His usage at Missouri hides some of Burden’s technical skills that will help him transition to the NFL, and it may lead \nsome to believe he’s good but undeserving of the WR1 title in the class.  \n \nThose technical skills exist in his game and if they’re not good enough for him to win early, they’re close. Burden’s game is \ngood enough that he can deliver at all three receiver roles – at least at a high level situationally. There’s good reason to \nbelieve he’ll have an instant impact in an NFL offense and emerge as one of the top-two offensive producers in the passing \ngame as a rookie.  \n \n\n \n53 \nBurden is fast enough to win downfield or pull away from pursuit after the catch. He can deliver a second gear late in the \nroute. If he already has a step, Burden uses his hands at the top of his stems just before the ball arrives to enforce the \nseparation he earned.  \n \nBurden’s release packages against press coverage are versatile and sudden, but he’ll need to be more artful with the pacing \nto excel. Burden may not be ready to challenge top cover corners who press him this year, but there’s enough skill there to \nsee how he can become that type of threat in the future.  \n \nOnce he’s into his stem, Burden uses pacing changes effectively to set up his breaks, which is another bit of evidence that \nhis release footwork will eventually follow.  \n \nBecause Missouri likes to target Burden across the field or on vertical shots we don’t see a lot of routes breaking back to the \nquarterback. When he runs then, Burden has good deceleration into hard breaks.  \n \nMost of his routes break across the field and in those cases, Burden has sharp turns so his breaks don’t drift. Burden snaps \nhis turns to generate added separation on these routes.  \n \nAn excellent zone receiver, Burden knows when to settle into a void and when to tempo his breaks across the field. He only \nshows his eyes when he has crossed beyond defenders who could cut off a target.  \n \nWhen Burden’s quarterback breaks the pocket, Burden knows when to work back to the passer and when to go downfield \nand uncover while disguising to the cornerback that the ball is coming.   \n \nBurden tracks the ball behind his break path on sail routes, turning his pads to address the ball with his hands. He tracks \nthe ball over his shoulder on routes of all distances and he uses overhand position as his first-choice with attacking routes \nwith his back to the quarterback.  \nBurden doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets arriving over his head. He can high-point without leaving his feet. He \nalso tracks the ball over his shoulder and makes one-handed grabs in the vertical game against tight coverage.  \nBurden attacks targets at the numbers and pads with overhand position. He’ll catch targets near his waist with underhand \nattack. He tracks targets behind his break path and extends well for the ball with overhand position.  \nBurden extends his arms with overhand attack to earn targets away from his frame. He’ll also extend to attack at the \nearliest window of arrival. His hands can be tighter when attacking to prevent the potential of targets going through his \nhands. I haven’t seen this happen, but when the hands are wide enough most receivers experience this problem with high-\nvelocity throws at the NFL level.  \nBurden’s positioning between the defender and the ball is timely and effective. He protects the ball from coverage as soon \nas he makes the catch. He’s going to become a quarterback’s favorite in the middle of the field and in the red zone because \nof how well he scrambles, uncovers, and earns position to win the ball.  \nAfter the catch, Burden is one of the two best runners in the open field in this receiver class. The other, Savion Williams, \nmight become a very good NFL running back, depending how the league envisions him.  \n \nBurden catches and pierces with excellent acceleration. When catching the ball on a route breaking to the boundary, he’ll \nset up defenders with a step or two where he obeys the ball. He’ll then make a tight spin inside to catch the defender over-\npursuing.  \nBurden sees the field well as a receiver. He knows how to use the boundary as his weapon to break back inside. He also \nuses his blockers and isn’t afraid to split defenders – and teammates on defenders – to make a straight path to the end \nzone.  \nHe’s a patient runner behind blockers, setting them up with pacing and movement to press blocks and exploit the cutback. \nAlthough he’s good at taking what the defense gives him and splitting players to work in a straight line, Burden is creative \nand willing to reverse field. When he does, he exhausts other options and sets up the reversal with presses downfield much \nearlier to draw the defense.  \nHe’s good at setting up cutbacks and bounces with presses and coordinated footwork—even quick combinations of \nmovement.  \n\n \n54 \nBurden has excellent short-area quickness and can make multiple defenders miss in traffic. He uses quick turns, stop-start \nmovements, and efficient stutters to make defenders miss in a phone booth.  \nOne of the reasons he can make defenders miss is his quick deceleration with the drop of his weight and jump cut away \nfrom opponents.  \nBurden has excellent patience and suddenness with his double up as an open-field runner. Burden layers moves in \nsuccession that are efficient and dynamic.  \nWhen taking fly sweeps, Burden can transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway with two quick steps. He has \na sharp lateral cut and he’ll use lateral movement to press creases on perimeter plays to set up cutbacks to the inside.  \nBurden also has an effective spin to the inside as he’s exiting the crease and taking on the defender over the top.  \nBurden’s quickness helps him pull through multiple reaches in traffic. His pad level is good enough to duck under reaches of \ndefenders and pull through. He keeps his feet moving through contact, and he has a well-timed stiff-arm to work through \nreaches to his frame and shrug off defenders in the open field.  \nHe may not be ready to become the team’s primary receiver this year because he’s not a dominant press-man receiver at \nthe line of scrimmage, but he’ll be an excellent slot-flanker option who can do just about everything else at a high level.  \n \nBurden gives a team so many ways to move the ball and score points, it’s going to be fun to watch. If he were in last year’s \ndraft, I would have taken him ahead of Marvin Harrison, Jr. – and annual subscribers know there was not a bit of hindsight \nanalysis embedded into that statement.  \n \nReleases: Burden aligns in a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at \neither side of his knee. Burden sinks lower into his stance and releases from the line with his pads over his knees, his head \nup, and without wasted motion. He rolls off his front foot. Burden can improve his arm motion to cultivate a sprinter’s gait \nand better sell the possibility of the deep route.  \nWhen setting up a two-man route combination as the inside receiver waiting out the outside receiver to go deep, Burden \nuses a double-up to change the pace of the route and set up the defenders playing over him.  \nHe has a sudden two-quick, but can improve the pacing to set it up. Burden uses a one-step stretch to steal a release in the \nrunning game. His three-quick is sudden when setting up an inside break at the top of a stem against off-coverage.  \nThere isn’t a contrast with patience and suddenness with most of his footwork off the line, but he sets up the stick with a \npatient-but-sudden quality. He also uses a delayed double-up that’s sudden when executed.  \nBirden has a hesitation but uses it more against off-coverage and could benefit to use it in combination with other footwork.  \nAt the top of stems against zone coverage, Burden sets up the defender with a stick and counters with a shed. Against \noutside-shade coverage getting a bump during the initial release, Burden reduces the shoulder.  \nThe only combinations of footwork and hand counters at the line of scrimmage against a defender that I’ve seen in four \ngames was a read step and a shoulder reduction (Auburn) and a pair of two quicks and a wipe counter (Alabama). I have \nseen a two-quick and shed counter at the top of a stem that was performed in succession. \nHe earned separation with both. He stacked the Alabama defender but the defender was in C3 and the S didn’t bite hard on \nthe play fake, which gave him time to cut off the vertical shot for the interception.  \nBurden attempts hand counters that aren’t the best choice for the position of the defender. For instance, it makes no sense \nto do a shoulder reduction at full speed with a defender about to cut off his path downfield and his hands are at his chest. A \nrip, wipe, or slot makes more sense.  \nSeparation: Burden can accelerate past cornerbacks that have an angle on him in the open field. He can beat cornerbacks \nat the line of scrimmage on vertical and deep routes. He’ll also stack them early or late.  \nLate in routes, Burden can use one hand to frame separation and catch the ball with the other on vertical targets.  \n\n \n55 \nRoute Stems: Against off coverage with significant cushion, Burden will give brief stem to the outside to enforce the \ndefender’s widen position but doesn’t oversell it if he already has the position on a shallower route.  \nAgainst off coverage, Burden will give a pace change to set up his stem and break.  \nRoute Setups: Burden shows his head and eyes at the top of stems to sell the stem leading into the break. On vertical \nroutes, Burden will work into the back of the defender before breaking back to the inside or outside.  \nRoute Breaks: With shallow out-breaking routes, Burden has a tight speed break with a sharp drive step and flat line step. \nBurden punches the boundary-side arm and generates snap with his turns. His head gets around to the quarterback quickly.  \nAfter five games, I’ve only seen Burden execute one hard break with weight drop, but he can do it on an intermediate route \nthat breaks outside and deliver a flat break.  \nZone Routes: When breaking across a zone, Burden tempos his break pace to maximize his availability. He also tempos his \nstems before breaking into the open zone so he’s helping his teammates’ routes set up the space he’ll break into.  \nBurden identifies the second-level defender and zone triangle. He works to depth and settles into the open area, presenting \na friendly target to his quarterback. When working vertical routes through a zone, Burden doesn’t show his eyes until he has \npassed the rollover or buzz defender.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work with his quarterback as the passer breaks the pocket.  \nRoute Boundary: Burden is aware of the boundary and toe taps to stay in bounds when facing the target. He can also drag \nhis feet at the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Burden tracks the ball behind his break path on sail routes, turning his pads to address the ball with his \nhands. He tracks the ball over his shoulder on routes of all distances and he uses overhand position as his first-choice with \nattacking routes with his back to the quarterback.  \nBurden doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets arriving over his head. He can high-point without leaving his feet. He \nalso tracks the ball over his shoulder and makes one-handed grabs in the vertical game against tight coverage.  \nLike using late hands, something he also executes well, Burden can work the scramble drill to a vertical target, stay with the \nDB tight, and lead the DB in one direction before uncovering late to where the ball will arrive in the opposite direction.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Burden attacks targets at the numbers and pads with overhand position. He’ll catch targets near his \nwaist with underhand attack. He tracks targets behind his break path and extends well for the ball with overhand position.  \nBurden extends his arms with overhand attack to earn targets away from his frame. He’ll also extend to attack at the \nearliest window of arrival. His hands can be tighter when attacking to prevent the potential of targets going through his \nhands. I haven’t seen this happen, but when the hands are wide enough most receivers experience this problem with high-\nvelocity throws at the NFL level.  \nPosition: Burden has an effective jump up and through, pullback, and embracing of the fall.  \nFocus: Burden can take contact to his back and/or chest when catching the football. He also tracks the ball over his \nshoulder and makes one-handed grabs in the vertical game against tight coverage. He can win downfield between two \ndefenders tight to him while tracking the ball over his shoulder.  \nTransitions: Burden catches and pierces with excellent acceleration. When catching the ball on a route breaking to the \nboundary, he’ll set up defenders with a step or two where he obeys the ball. He’ll then make a tight spin inside to catch the \ndefender overo-pursuing.  \nElusiveness: Burden has excellent short-area quickness and can make multiple defenders miss in traffic. He uses quick \nturns, stop-start movements, and efficient stutters to make defenders miss in a phone booth.  \nOne of the reasons he can make defenders miss is his quick deceleration with the drop of his weight and jump cut away \nfrom opponents.  \nHe has excellent patience and suddenness with his double up as an open-field runner. Burden layers moves in succession \nthat are efficient and dynamic.  \n\n \n56 \nWhen taking fly sweeps, Burden can transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway with two quick steps. He has \na sharp lateral cut and he’ll use lateral movement to press creases on perimeter plays to set up cutbacks to the inside.  \nBurden has an effective spin to the inside as he’s exiting the crease and taking on the defender over the top.  \nVision: Burden sees the field well as a receiver. He knows how to use the boundary as his weapon to break back inside. He \nalso uses his blockers and isn’t afraid to split defenders – and teammates on defenders – to make a straight path to the end \nzone.  \nBurden’s a patient runner behind blockers, setting them up with pacing and movement to press blocks and exploit the \ncutback. Although he’s good at taking what the defense gives him and splitting players to work in a straight line, Burden is \ncreative and willing to reverse field. When he does, he exhausts other options and sets up the reversal with presses \ndownfield much earlier to draw the defense.  \nHe’s good at setting up cutbacks and bounces with presses and coordinated footwork—even quick combinations of \nmovement.  \nPower: Burden’s quickness helps him pull through multiple reaches in traffic. His pad level is good enough to duck under \nreaches of defenders and pull through. He keeps his feet moving through contact.  \nBurden has a well-timed stiff-arm to work through reaches to his frame and shrug off defenders in the open field.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Burden at least stalemates cornerbacks striking him directly and can push forward for additional \nyardage. He can win a collision with a safety coming downhill and extend forward through the hit. He also stalemates off-\nball linebackers when hit high.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Burden drops the pads and bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks and safeties. He’ll \ndrop the hammer on a cornerback in the open field.  \nBall Security: Burden carries the ball high to his chest. The elbow swings as he runs in the open field, but it remains tight \nto his side. He takes contact to his ball-carrying arm without losing security. He uses the correct arm based on the side of \nthe field he’s running or the position of pursuit.  \nLarger defenders that blindside him can shake the ball free, if struck on the elbow.  \nBlocking: Burden breaks down within two yards of his opponents as a lead blocker on Man Over Me assignments. He \ndelivers his arms with an uppercut motion. The elbows are bent, the arms are tight, and he aims for the chest.  \nBurden is in a square and squat position and he shuffles his feet well laterally. He must close the gap between himself and \nthe defender so he doesn’t get thrown aside as easily after establishing contact.  \nBecause he doesn’t close the gap tight enough or throw a true uppercut with force as a stalk blocker, Burden’s efforts serve \nas either a wall-off blocker or a small speedbump for a defender.  \nWhen force to throw a punch – for instance, sealing a linebacker or safety at the edge as the tight receiver on trips, Burden \noverextends and leads with a pad rather than anchoring and striking. This method increases the chances of a defender \nworking around him and avoiding the block immediately.  \nWhen Burden is accurate the strike is effective enough to temporarily slow the defender, but he’s out of position to sustain \ncontact and control the opponent. I’ve seen one uppercut punch with an attempt to roll through the hips during the strike in \nthree games (Auburn), but he overextended into the contact and the roll through the hips was uncoordinated with the \nstrike.  \nDurability: No significant injuries during career.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Burden is a top-three pick for me in this class regardless of when you’re drafting. I’m 95 \npercent sure I’ll feel that way regardless of landing spot. The nice thing for most of you in dynasty leagues is that the \nfavorite No.1 overall selection is Tetairoa McMillan.  \n \nIf you’re savvy about your league, you might have the opportunity to trade down from an early spot, collect a receiver who \nwould have been a top-three talent in last year’s class, and get another pick for doing so.  \n\n \n57 \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nAttack, Transitions, Vision/Open-Field Decision-Making \n• \nPatience, pacing, and stiff arm \n• \nMature reversal of field \n• \nRelease, stem, stair-step, tracking, attack, focus.  \n• \nScramble drill, uncovers late, drags feet \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n58",
        "analysis": "Luther Burden III is a highly-rated wide receiver prospect (RSP WR1) with a diverse skillset and exceptional athleticism.  His college production, however, might undersell his true potential due to Missouri's offensive scheme.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Versatility:** Can play all three receiver positions effectively, showcasing situational excellence.  This makes him a valuable asset in any NFL offense.\n* **Athleticism & Speed:** Possesses impressive speed, allowing him to win deep and pull away after the catch.  He shows good acceleration and a second gear.\n* **Route Running:**  Excels at route precision, particularly in zone concepts, demonstrating excellent tempo and awareness of defensive positioning.  He displays sharp breaks and effective pacing changes to create separation.\n* **Ball Skills:**  Demonstrates strong hands, reliable tracking ability (even over his shoulder), and the capability to high-point the ball without jumping.  He shows an understanding of using his body to shield the ball from defenders.\n* **After the Catch:**  One of the best run-after-catch players in the draft class, showcasing excellent short-area quickness, elusiveness, vision, and the ability to make multiple defenders miss.  He uses a variety of moves effectively.\n* **Contested Catches:** Comfortable catching the ball in tight coverage and taking contact to the body.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Press Coverage:**  While possessing a versatile release package, he needs to refine his technique against press coverage to consistently win at the line of scrimmage against top NFL corners. His pacing and artistry in releases need improvement.\n* **Release Consistency:** While his releases are sudden, he needs to be more consistent and artful with his pacing to sell routes better and avoid predictable patterns.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided ranges from Brandon Aiyuk (a more polished, complete receiver) to Rashee Rice, Dontayvion Wicks, and Quintez Cephus (receivers with varying levels of NFL success and skill sets). This suggests Burden's ceiling is high, but his floor could depend on his development and team fit.  He projects as a player with a similar blend of athleticism and route-running ability to Aiyuk, but with a possibly higher ceiling given his run-after-catch skills.  However, if he doesn't develop his press-coverage release, he may end up closer to the Rice/Wicks/Cephus tier.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBurden is a high-ceiling prospect with the potential to be a dynamic offensive weapon in the NFL. His combination of athleticism, route-running skills, and after-catch ability is enticing. However, refining his press-coverage release and consistently applying his technical skills will be crucial for maximizing his NFL potential.  He’s a likely high-round pick who could become a top-two offensive producer in his rookie season if he develops according to his potential.\n"

He could also become a Pro-Bowl cornerback. Can he do \nboth?  \n \nIf we’re talking 70-80 years ago? Absolutely. It hasn’t happened in my lifetime of watching football and I’m skeptical there \nis an NFL coach who will be open to trying it out.  \n \nAt best, Hunter will see gadgetry work on offense, perform on special teams, and star as a cornerback. Or, Hunter will \nprimarily play wide receiver, but earn some duty as a cornerback in situational matchups.  \n \n\n \n59 \nAs much as a man can dream of Hunter delivering 70-90 catches for 1,000-1,200 yards and 10 TDs on offense while \nintercepting 8-10 passes and shutting down primary receivers on Sundays, I’ll need to see an entire year of it to believe it.  \nThat leads us to the biggest question about Hunter’s scouting report?  \n \nWhat position is Hunter going to play in the NFL? At this moment, it appears to depend on the coach and management of \nthe team that drafts him. I’m in the cornerback camp, although it’s disappointing to limit Hunter’s offensive potential.  \n \nIt means, as good as Hunter looks at wide receiver, it’s a big risk to select him in fantasy leagues before we know who \ndrafts him in the NFL and what their intentions are for using him.  \n \nFor the sake of this report, let’s presume he will be a full-time wide receiver. Hunter is a skilled route runner with big-play \nability as a vertical weapon and a runner after the catch.  \n \nAs good as Hunter is as a cover corner, he’s not as good against them at the line of scrimmage. He has a variety of moves \nand many of them work well because he can incorporate some pacing variation into the process that baits his opponents.  \n \nHe must develop this detail with all of his releases. Hunter also needs to be more selective about the moves he uses against  \noff-coverage when playing outside. Bad choices have gotten him pinned to the boundary.  \n \nHunter’s setups are effective although he can do more with pacing and attacking leverage at full speed. His breaks a precise \nand there’s little problem with their execution.  \n \nHunter’s work against man-to-man coverage is at a stage where it’s good enough to get him on the field and should only \nimprove as he adds more tools to his repertoire.  \n \nHunter’s doesn’t have difficulty finding the ball, but he can leave his feet unnecessarily for targets above his head. It means \nhe may lack confidence with gauging trajectory clearly on routes over the middle. These unnecessary leaps can cost Hunter \n1-2 steps as a runner after the catch and limit gains.  \n \nThis isolated bit of tracking is the only issue I have with Hunter’s pass-catching. His technique is sound. There’s little, if any \nclap-attacking or instances of using suboptimal attacks, and he wins against contact. Hunter also has effective positioning \non contested plays to earn and keep the ball in tight coverage downfield.  \n \nAfter the catch, Hunter gets his feet over shots with high knees when working the open field or around the corner. Hunter \nonly needs two steps to decelerate. He has a tight spin and good stop-start quickness.  \nHunter has patience with setting up lead blocks on screens and RPOs. He’ll press the blockers before accessing the crease \nwith a bounce or cutback. He’s decisive about getting downhill when there are blocks.  \nHe isn’t wise enough to hit creases and get downhill based on game scenario and unblocked defenders. He’ll try to bounce \nplays or even retreat when he shouldn’t. This is typical of players who are anointed the playmaker of their team—they take \nmatters into their own hands too often. He should grow out of this.  \nHunter is a legitimate playmaker who blends good technique and conceptual knowledge of the position with excellent \nathletic ability and creativity. If he doesn’t begin his career as a full-time receiver, there’s still a chance he may end it as \none. \n \nReleases: Hunter has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front leg. His arms hang at either side \nof his knee. He sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion.  \nHunter has lapses where there’s a slight rock off the back foot before he releases from the line. This happens with vertical \nroutes where there is no rock that is advisable.  \nHunter has a read step with a wipe counter. He attacks the leverage of the defender and waits for the defender to shoot his \nhands before countering. He also uses a blade release counter – shoulder reduction and shed combo – with the read step.  \nHe also uses a read step with a swat-swim counter or shed counter.  \nHunter uses a foot-switch to get outside tight coverage. He has a patient but sudden two-quick. He also uses it to steal a \nrelease. Hunter also combines a two-quick and stick to steal a release.  \n\n \n60 \nHunter reduces his shoulder from contact, but can get himself pinned to the boundary when he attempts to use it against \noff-coverage.  \nHunter has a double swat off the line and has good placement with his hands as well as violence. Hunter’s hesitation is \npatient and he’ll follow up with a violent read step.  \nHunter delivers an effective hip shift mid-step against off-coverage. He’ll counter a defender’s hands with a swat.  \nHunter can deliver a stick with a wipe counter. His double up to the inside has good quickness. Hunter has a capable lean-in \nto set up breaks inside. He has a good double-up and hip shift combo.  \nDespite his quickness, footwork, and hand counters, he gets pushed around and taken off his line frequently.  \nSeparation: Hunter can stack a defender immediately off the line. He wins intermediate- and vertical-distance routes.  \nRoute Stems: Hunter will widen his stem and run at the defender. Je \nRoute Setups: Hunter will take the back of the defender to set up a break and change pace with a patience taking of the \nback and sudden burst downhill. He’ll deliver a peek to the fade to set up a break inside on a vertical route. He has a \ncapable inset at the top of a stem to sell the post and then break on the fade.  \nRoute Breaks: Hunter has a three-step break with a long break step. He drops his weight into the break. He gets his head \naround and faces the quarterback with a friendly position. He’ll also attack the target by breaking back to the ball.  \nHunter’s line drive steps and line steps are flat with speed breaks with shallow outs.  \nZone Routes: Hunter identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. If the buzz \ndefender slides into the passing lane, Hunter slides to the open area.  \nHunter will tempo his breaks across a zone. \nRoute Boundary: Hunter drags his feet at the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Hunter leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at his shoulders and helmet.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Hunter uses overhand attack at the numbers. He will attack the ball at the earliest point. Hunter can \nalso high-point while taking contact to his back – including targets high and behind his break path.  \nHunter uses underhand attack away from his frame and below his knees. He’ll also dig out low throws, leaving his feet to do \nso.  \nPosition: Hunter has effective jump up and through positioning, he can attack the ball at the earliest window, and he’ll pull \nthe ball away from coverage. When going to the ground, he turns to avoid landing on the ball.  \nFocus: Hunter takes contact to his back and earns the ball against tight coverage.  \nTransitions: Hunter catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: He gets his feet over shots with high knees when working the open field or around the corner. Hunter only \nneeds two steps to decelerate. He has a tight spin and good stop-start quickness.  \nVision: Hunter has patience with setting up lead blocks on screens and RPOs. He’ll press the blockers before accessing the \ncrease with a bounce or cutback. He’s decisive about getting downhill when there are blocks. He isn’t wise enough to hit \ncreases and get downhill based on game scenario and unblocked defenders. He’ll try to bounce plays or even retreat when \nhe shouldn’t.  \nPower: Hunter has a capable stiff arm that wards off reaches to defenders. He has an effective balance-touch. Hunter can \npull through wraps to his waist.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Hunter can stalemate a nickel back when he has a downhill runway into the hit.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Hunter can bounce off a hard glancing shot from a cornerback.  \n\n \n61 \nBall Security: Hunter carries the ball close to his chest. He can take contact to his ball-carrying arm. He swings his arm \nwhile running so the elbow isn’t as tight to his side as it should be. He’ll switch the ball to the boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Hunter works to the safety in Most Dangerous Man Assignments. He also closes the gap and earns a chest-to-\nchest position. His arms are bent and he keeps his feet moving. However, he doesn’t drop his weight and this leads to \noverextension after initial contact. This can get his shed aside.  \nWhen he drops his weight against Man over Me Assignments, Hunter shuffles his feet but overextends. He still earns tight \nhands into the chest of the opponent and moves his feet well.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Hunter works toward the force player’s inside shoulder to turn the man outside. If he didn’t overextend, \nhe’d have better position to sustain the effort.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you want to gamble on Hunter’s upside as an offensive player, hoping he lands on a \nteam that gives him a legitimate offensive role, I’d wait until the fourth round of fantasy drafts that occur before the NFL \nDraft to take that shot.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nTempo-ing Break, Knowledge of Triangle, and Catch vs. Contact to Back \n• \nHigh-Point, Jump Up and Through, Sandwiched, Embrace the Fall \n• \nStick, Stack, Inset, Fade \n• \nDouble Up + Stick = Hip-Shift \n• \nMismanagement as a ball carrier \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n62",
        "analysis": "Travis Hunter is a highly-rated (WR2) dual-threat prospect capable of playing both wide receiver and cornerback at a high level.  His exceptional athleticism and skillset make him a unique talent, but his NFL future is uncertain due to his versatility and the potential for differing team uses.\n\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Offensive Skills:**  Excellent route runner with precise breaks and a knack for creating separation, especially on vertical routes.  High-points the ball well and displays good hands, winning contested catches consistently.  A dangerous runner after the catch with elusiveness and good acceleration/deceleration.  Shows understanding of route concepts and leverage.\n* **Defensive Skills:** Skilled cover cornerback with quickness, good footwork, and effective hand counters. Displays patient technique in reading the opponent before releasing.\n* **Athleticism:** Exceptional speed, agility, and quickness, making him a threat on both sides of the ball.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Offensive Role:**  If given a significant offensive role, he has the potential to be a high-volume receiver with 1000+ yard seasons. His ceiling is extremely high if he solely focuses on receiving.\n* **Situational Defensive Usage:** Even if primarily a receiver, he could be a valuable asset on defense in specific matchups.\n* **Gadget Plays:** His versatility lends itself to creative offensive schemes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **Offensive Consistency:**  Can sometimes be overly aggressive as a ball carrier, making poor decisions in choosing running lanes. Needs to improve decision-making in this area.\n* **Route Running Refinement:** While already skilled, he can refine his releases and counter moves against off-coverage to avoid being pinned to the boundary.  He also occasionally leaves his feet unnecessarily on high throws.\n* **Defensive Physicality:** Despite good techniques, he can get pushed around by stronger receivers at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  Chris Olave (for his route running and receiving skills) and Ricky Pearsall (for his overall athleticism and potential as a dual-threat player) are good benchmarks.  However, a direct comparison is difficult due to his unique two-way potential.  His NFL role will significantly impact his production and therefore his true comparison.  He could potentially develop into a more well-rounded version of either player, with the added defensive capabilities.\n\n\n**Overall:** Travis Hunter is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His future success depends heavily on the team that drafts him and their strategy for utilizing his talents. While his offensive potential is exciting, his defensive prowess and versatility provide a crucial safety net and a reason to select him high despite the uncertainty.  His fantasy value is contingent upon his NFL role and should only be considered in later rounds until his positional situation is clear.\n"

The suggestion is that Golden’s yards per route run (YPPR) looks like Mecole \nHardman’s.  \n\n \n63 \n \nThat may be true, but Hardman’s actual game has never looked like Golden’s. I wish this correlation bore fruit because it \nwould mean the brand of alto saxophone I own means I can improvise like Charlie Parker.  \n \nYes, Golden’s 4.29-second, 40-Yard Dash is an impressive mark, but it’s not as impressive as his overall game. If anything, \nit’s more impressive that Golden knows how to use his speed as a route runner beyond vertical routes.  \n \nGolden attacks stems at full speed with a lot of intermediate routes where many deep threats fail to sell that phase of the \nroute, making the process predictable for coverage. The attack during the stem as well as the angles Golden takes to set up \nhis breaks can bait defenders. The same is true with how Golden uses his eyes to emphasize the angle of his setups.  \n \nGolden’s breaks are no worse than competent and often good enough to separate from tight man-to-man coverage because \nthe sharpness of his turns and complete weight drop during the deceleration process. He’s not always executing these \nbreaks with the desired precision, but he has no problem with performing these tasks at a high level. He’ll address these \nlapses.  \n \nGolden attacks the ball at its earliest window when it arrives on the numbers. He can turn behind his break path, catch the \nball with overhand position away from his frame, and transition downhill -- obeying the ball -- in one smooth motion.  \nGolden is good at tracking the ball from one shoulder and rotating his body around to the opposite side where the ball is \narriving. His hand-eye coordination is a strength of his game.  \n \nGolden doesn’t lose catches due to contact. He’s good at pulling the ball away and turning his body to avoid landing on the \nball when he hits the ground.  \n \nThe one area where Golden can improve is inconsistencies with his jump up and through technique to position himself  \nbetween the defender and the ball. Golden can have better timing and attack technique. He also has shown—within the \nsame game—that he can execute with good timing and optimal attack technique. When he has more space to operate the \nexecution is better. When pinned to the boundary, his technique suffers.  \n \nAfter the catch, Golden has the quickness, body control, and vision to make multiple defenders miss in traffic and in the \nopen field. He’ll also finish with his pads and work through contact in the secondary.  \n \nGolden lacks the desirable size of a split end, but he has the speed of one and the budding skills to defeat the opponent’s \nbest cover corner deep. He can become a primary receiver at flanker in a West Coast Offense.  \n \nGolden can turn short passes into breakaway gains, but he can also make the plays in the middle of the field that move the \nchains. I have no doubt he can eventually thrive from the slot, if that’s a team’s desire.  \n \nGolden reminds me of players like Tim Brown and Jayden Reed. They can beat you in multiple ways and in multiple roles.  \n \nGolden is a match-up player—give him a route and tell him to win his matchup and he’ll do it. Hardman is a scheme \nplayer—get 10 teammates to create a scenario where they manipulate Hardman’s opponent into a disadvantage. The data \nmay have some coincidental similarities but the contexts of how it was generated couldn’t be farther apart.  \n \nReleases: Golden has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee. Golden sinks into his stance to begin his release. He rolls off his front foot with his pads over his \nknees. His arms move at their full range of motion and he attacks stems at full speed.  \n \nThere is a rock off that back foot before rolling off the front foot he can curtail from his release. It’s a tell for him. When he’s \nrunning a route where he expects the ball as an early read, he doesn’t rock off the foot. When he’s blocking or working as a \nsecondary option, he rocks off the back foot.  \n \nGolden uses a read step out to steal a release in the running game. He reduces his shoulder from contact as he works inside \na defender in the flat. He’ll also counter with a swat or a shed.  \n \nHis feet-switch and two-quick combo when stealing a release has a patient and sudden quality.  \n \nGolden delivers a violent stick and counters the defender’s hands with a shoulder reduction. He uses a read step and lean-in \nto set up an out against tight coverage in the end zone.  \n \nGolden has an effective two-quick and double swat to attack outside leverage and release inside.  \n \nSeparation: He can win intermediate and vertical routes against tight man-to-man and stack.  \n \nRoute Stems: Golden attacks stems at full speed on intermediate speed outs. He’ll dive his stems as a setup for a stair-\nstep, but his second phase of the stair-step—the vertical sale—wasn’t executed sharp enough on this rep. He’ll widen his \nstems and run at a defender, too.  \n \n\n \n64 \nRoute Setups: Golden shows his eyes inside while performing a lean-in to give the impression he’s blocking before \ndelivering a speed turn with a flat drive and line step and working back to the ball.  \n \nGolden delivers an inset at the top of an intermediate stem with a good stick and turn of the eyes inside before breaking on \nthe sail route.  \n \nGolden can deliver a sharp stair-step against zone coverage. He has an effective peek to the fade and then drop and pop \nwith good weight drop to execute the curl. \n \nGolden will also peek late to sell the corner route at the top of a stem up the seam. He’ll combine it with a late widening of \nthe stem toward the Cover 3 corner on the outside. As he reaches the corner, he counters the defender’s hands with a wipe.  \nGolden works into the back of the defender to set up a break back to the ball.  \n \nRoute Breaks: Golden has a long break step after attacking a stem at full speed. His drive step can be about 45 degrees \nflatter but he gets a flat line step out of the turn. He gets his head around early. \n  \nWhen delivering speed breaks on a shallow route both the drive and line steps are flat. This is the case with in- and out-\nbreaking shallow routes.  \n \nWhen the quarterback breaks the pocket and Golden hasn’t earned a target, he works with the quarterback to an open area \non the side of the field where the quarterback is traveling. \n  \nGolden has a long break step into a drop and pop break but the weight drop isn’t deep when facing off-coverage. When \nfacing tight man coverage the weight drop is there, but we need to see him attack his stem at full speed in these instances.  \nHe also has a long break step into a three-step break.  \n \nHis weight drop is good enough for whip routes against man-to-man and hitch-and-go’s against off-man. Golden also drops \nhis weight effectively to turn back on an underthrown/back-shoulder target.  \n \nGolden snaps shallow outs when he has a defender tight to him at the top of the stem.  \n \nZone Routes: Golden identifies the second level, defender, works too depth, and settles into the open space. He snaps his \nturns when settling.  \n \nWhen breaking across the field, Golden can wait to show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \n \nRoute Boundary: Golden can toe-tap tight to the boundary when catching the ball.  \n \nPass Tracking: Golden attacks the ball at its earliest window when it arrives on the numbers. He can turn behind his break \npath, catch the ball with overhand position away from his frame, and transition downhill -- obeying the ball -- in one smooth \nmotion. Golden is good at tracking the ball from one shoulder and rotating his body around to the opposite side where the \nball is arriving.  \n \nGolden can track over the shoulder with one hand.  \n \nHands/Catch Radius: Golden can extend his arms fully for a ball at number’s height away from his frame with underhand \nposition. Golden allows the ball into his frame on a speed out near the boundary with coverage trailing. He attacks with \nunderhand position when he had a great opportunity to use overhand.  \n \nHe clap-attacks low targets he extends for. He can squat for targets arriving below his knees. He extends for these targets, \nbut also clap-attacks. He can high-point the ball.  \n \nGolden must stop clap-trapping targets low and away from his frame because he’s too close to the ground to embrace the \nfall and lands on the football.  \n \nPosition: Golden can secure the ball while falling to the ground after a full extension of his arms for the ball and embrace \nthe fall so he doesn’t land on the football. Golden uses a pullback when catching targets as he faces a trailing defender.  \nHis jump up and through technique can have better timing and attack technique. He also has shown—within the same \ngame—that he can execute with good timing and optimal attack technique. When he has more space to operate the \nexecution is better. When pinned to the boundary, his technique suffers.  \n \nFocus: Golden can catch the ball with overhand attack and take a wrap to his back. He can take a hit and wrap to his back \non a back-shoulder target he clap-attacked while parallel with the ground.  \n \nGolden high-points the ball against tight coverage at his chest. He can track over the shoulder with one hand with a \ndefender grabbing the other.  \n \nTransitions: Golden will catch and pierce downhill. He obeys the ball.  \n\n \n65 \n \nElusiveness: Golden has an effective stick to set up his crossing the face of the defender over the top of him. He’ll spin \nthrough contact, hoping to work away from it. He has a tight spin that can make multiple defenders miss.  \n \nAt full speed, he can go from a downhill path to a boundary path – a 90-degree turn in one step by opening his hips with \nthe point of the toe.  \n \nVision: Golden is patient after his catch and pierce to press an inside lane against an unblocked defender and then \ncrossover and take the outside lane. He also identifies and eliminates pursuit angles quickly.  \n \nPower: Golden has a stiff-arm that wards off defenders reaching for his torso and he can run out of the reach. He drops his \npads into contact.  \n \nDirect Contact Balance: He has low pad level into a collision with a safety who has a runway and stalemates the defender.  \n \nIndirect Contact Balance: N/A. \n \nBall Security: Golden carries the ball under his left arm high to his chest, but loose at the elbow. He uses the left arm as \nhis default—even when working up the right boundary with pursuit over the top or to his left.  \n \nHe can carry the ball under his right arm up the right boundary, but it’s more the exception than the rule. He can take \ncontact to the ball and ball-carrying arm. He can also close the elbow tight to his frame when he knows he’s in heavy traffic \nand contact is imminent.  \n \nBlocking: Golden works inside against edge defenders with a square and squat position. His elbows are bent when he gets \nhis hands on the defender. He moves his feet to remain square with the larger defender as long as possible. He can anchor \nlong enough that the running back can turn the corner before the defensive end or linebacker sheds Golden and wraps the \nrunner from behind.  \n \nGolden will transition from route runner to blocker in the open zone and tilt into a linebacker or safety, delivering a \nshoulder. It would be better if he got square and shielded the defender.  \n \nAt the line of scrimmage, Golden is a “hugger” who takes contact with his arms wide rather than an attacker who punches \nfirst with his arms tight. This can lead to defenders beating him without much contact.  \n \nWhen Golden’s hugging doesn’t backfire, he can latch onto the defender and run his feet to move the defender away from \nthe path to the ball carrier. Golden can be patient to approach off-coverage. He’ll shuffle his feet and meet the defender \nhalfway and allow the defender to come some of the way toward him so he doesn’t over pursue. \n \nGolden closes the gap between himself and the defender well enough to earn position. The concern is that the wide hands \ncould lead to holding penalties in the NFL.  \n \nDurability: Foot injury in Cotton Bowl against Ohio State this year. He had a foot injury in November of 2023 that cost him \nsome of the Baylor contest and was day-to-day. He missed the second half of the WVU game with a groin injury in October \n2023. He had a back injury against Memphis the week prior. No significant time missed.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I bet Golden is no worse than a late first-round pick in fantasy leagues prior to the NFL \nDraft, but if he slips to the second round, it’s an ideal time to land him, given the number of running backs earning buzz \nfrom this class.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nLean-in, use of eyes, works back to QB, suboptimal attack, boundary toe-taps \n• \nAttacks stem, widens DB, peek, drop and pop \n• \nAttacks behind break, early window, stays on feet, obeys ball, stalemates direct hit \n• \nDouble move, high-point with defender in chest, embraces fall \n• \nFeet-switch, blade release, inset, catch over the shoulder \n• \nOpen-field vision and movement \n• \nJump up and through technique needs improvement \n• \nWell-executed jump up and through technique later in same game as above \n• \nDouble Move, deceleration, weight drop, clap-attack, embraces fall \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n66",
        "analysis": "Matthew Golden is a WR prospect with exceptional speed (4.29 40-yard dash) and route-running skills, exceeding the typical profile of a speed-only receiver.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elite Speed and Acceleration:** His speed is a game-changer, allowing him to win vertically and create separation on intermediate routes.\n* **Route Running:**  He displays advanced route-running techniques, including effective stems, sharp breaks, and the ability to sell routes effectively, creating separation even against tight man coverage.  He's adept at using his eyes and body angles to manipulate defenders.\n* **Ball Skills:**  Excellent hand-eye coordination, consistently attacking the ball at its earliest window.  He's secure in the air and rarely drops passes, even under contact.  He shows proficiency tracking the ball over his shoulder and making difficult catches.\n* **After the Catch Ability:**  Possesses excellent vision, agility, and the ability to make defenders miss in the open field and power through contact.\n* **Versatility:**  Can excel in various roles, from deep threat to slot receiver, and contribute as a blocker.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Consistency:** While possessing high-level skills, he shows some inconsistency in his jump up and through technique, particularly when pinned to the boundary.  Improving this consistency would elevate his game significantly.\n* **Size:** Lacks ideal size for a split end, although his speed and skill compensate.\n* **Release:**  A tell in his release (rocking off the back foot) can be exploited by defenses.  Refining this could make him even more elusive.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report draws comparisons to Tim Brown (versatility, ability to win in various ways), Jayden Reed (similar skill set), Lee Evans (deep threat potential), and Curtis Samuel (versatility).  However, it explicitly differentiates him from Mecole Hardman, stating that while their yards-per-route-run may be similar statistically, their playing styles and effectiveness within their respective schemes are fundamentally different.  Golden is described as a matchup player who wins individually, unlike Hardman who relies more on scheme.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nGolden projects as a high-potential starting-caliber wide receiver in the NFL.  Addressing his minor inconsistencies and refining his technique will solidify his status as a top-tier player. His combination of speed, route-running ability, and after-the-catch skills make him a very exciting prospect.\n"

The reality is that it wouldn’t shock me at all if Bond proves to be Golden’s equal, \nif not the more productive player in the NFL. \nIf you saw Marvin Mims’ ascent with the Broncos in 2024, you learned that Sean Payton found a solution to get Mims on the \nfield and exploit the receiver’s strengths while minimizing his weaknesses. Mims excels at the catch point and after the \ncatch, but he has problems separating at the line of scrimmage and executing perimeter routes.  \n \n\n \n67 \nBond is Marvin Mims without the route issues. A better way of saying it, but requires some memory and age from readers, \nis that Bond has a lot of T.Y. Hilton to his game that could grow into Isaac Bruce’s skills.  \n \nBond has a strong array of releases, he stacks defenders well on intermediate and vertical routes, and he has the long \nspeed of a legitimate deep threat. This isn’t new to anyone who is casually familiar with Bond’s game.  \n \nWhat is less apparent to many is Bond’s route running against man-to-man coverage. He sets up breaks with a wide array \nof tools, and he executes precise breaks and works back to the ball.  \n \nAlthough Bond has a detail to address with how he attacks two specific target placements, one is an isolated problem and \nthe other is an occasional lapse of technique. Otherwise, his tracking, positioning, and catching are reliable. \n \nBond is a dangerous runner who manages traffic well. He knows when to be decisive and when to be patient. When he \nattacks his acceleration is a legitimate weapon against pursuit angles. \n \nBond lacks the size of a traditional WR1 in a starting lineup, but he has what it takes to become a top-end WR2 for his team \nwho can, at times, look like a WR1. If he continues improving his routes and addresses his specific lapses with attack, Bond \nmight transcend that WR2 label. \n \nReleases: Bond has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee. When he releases, he rocks off his back foot and rolls off the front foot. He has reps where he doesn’t rock \noff the back foot, but he still isn’t sinking into his stance. These reps are still the exception rather than the rule.  \nBond’s pads are over his knees and he attacks vertical stems at full speed.  \nBond delivers a blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed – to counter the hands of a defender playing off coverage \nwith outside shade. He also delivers a decisive wipe against inside leverage.  \nBond uses a double-up with a shoulder reduction or wipe as a counter. He uses a two-quick at the top of stems. Bond also \nuses two-quick and three-quick footwork to steal a release. He also delivers the three-quick to set up in-breaking routes.  \nHis feet-switch and wipe counter gets him inside outside leverage. Bond uses a hip shift at the top of stems against off \ncoverage.  \nBond has a double swat off a hitch-and-go. He has an effective two-quick with a swat-swim counter on slants.  \nBond uses a lean-in at the top of his stem against tight coverage to set up in-breaking routes.  \nSeparation: Bond can beat cornerbacks on intermediate and vertical stems (15-40 yards). He will stack defenders in the \nintermediate and vertical ranges of stems.  \nRoute Stems: Bond widens stems against off coverage and runs at the defender. He’ll also dive his stems against inside \nshade.  \nRoute Setups: After widening a stem and running at the defender playing off-coverage, he delivers a peek with his helmet \nto the boundary to set up the post. He can also drop his weight and turn his frame and head to the boundary to sell the \npeek as part of a hitch and go.  \nHe gives head and shoulder fakes at the top of stems. He delivers an inset at the top of a stem he stair-stepped against \nman coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Bond has a long break step. He can transition from that long break step into a three-step break with deep \nweight drop. He gets his head around early.  \nWith shallow speed outs, Bond has flat drive and line steps. He runs away from the defender out of the break and presents \na friendly target. He can also deliver a long break step into flat drive and line steps. \nHe works back to the ball with a friendly position to the quarterback. This includes working hard to cut off the defender \nwhen the target is egregiously underthrown.  \nBond has effective weight drop into whip routes and drop and pop routes. He can deliver a long break step into the drop and \npop.  \n\n \n68 \nBond can snap turns on speed outs.  \nZone Routes: Bond doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he passes the zone/rollover defender. He identifies the \nsecond-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open space.  \nWhen Bond’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to open space and tries to work with the quarterback. He will tempo \nvertical breaks.  \nRoute Boundary: Bond can high-point and toe tap the boundary with both feet while pushed or leaning out of bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Bond tracks the ball over his shoulder with underhand position near his chest. When a target is at \nshoulder-height and away from his frame, Bond can get crossed up with his attack and use an attack that lacks uniformity \nof hands positioning—trapping the ball high-low.  \nBond catches targets over his head without leaving his feet unnecessarily. He attacks the ball at the earliest window.  \nHands/Catch Radius: He catches targets with underhand position at his waist. He can squat low and attack with \nunderhand position as well.  \nBond high-points well and can win in clutch situations where he’s force to create separation while the ball is in the air and \nmake an acrobatic play. When using overhand position, he has lapses where he clap-attacks targets.  \nHe can attack the ball away from his frame with underhand position below his knees while on the move.  \nPosition: Bond embraces the fall when adjusting to low throws. He can pull back from the defender after securing the high-\npoint target.  \nFocus: Bond can take a wrap or hit to his chest or back after catching a target.  \nTransitions: Bond catches and pierces downhill. \nElusiveness: Bond only needs two quick steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway. With some \nruns, Bond only needs one thanks to his curvilinear speed. He only needs one when working to the far-side boundary and \ntransitioning downhill.  \nVision: Bond spots open space among unblocked defenders and works to those areas. He identifies open creases his \nblockers create and he’s patient with allowing a block to develop before accessing the crease.  \nWhen he hits creases, he hits them decisively and uses his acceleration as a weapon to work past angles of pursuit.  \nPower: Bond drops his pads into contact at the end of runs. He can run through lower-body wraps and upper-body reaches \nfrom defensive backs. \nBond uses the stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Bond can stalemate a safety when both defender have a runway into the collision. He has a \nbalance-touch to regain his stride when temporarily off balance.  \nBall Security: Bond carries the ball under his left arm up the left boundary. He uses the appropriate boundary-side arm or \narm away from the nearest pursuit. He carries the ball near his chest but swings the ball. His elbow is wide from his frame.  \nWhen Bond is in tight traffic, he keeps the elbow and arm tighter to his side and chest. He can maintain possession with a \ndefensive back pulling at the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlocking: Bond will earn a square and squat position with Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man assignments. Bond gets \npushed backward when beaten to the punch. He isn’t a puncher – he extends his arms but looks away as he’s doing so and \ndoesn’t deliver a strike. He uses a jab more than an uppercut.  \n\n \n69 \nBond is better at shielding than dictating position. Although his hands aren’t tight enough and he’s often too far from the \ndefender to eliminate space between them, Bond doesn’t overextend, he moves his feet, and he can turn a defender away \nfrom the ball carrier.  \nDurability: High ankle sprain in SEC Championship game in December 2024. He missed the first-round College Football \nPlayoff game against Clemson game the following week.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Bond could be a relative value if most of the public doesn’t have him as a top-five talent \nat this position. If you have multiple first-round picks in a rookie draft before the NFL Draft, you might decide Bond is worth \na late-first or early-second. I’m betting you can wait until the first half of the second round.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStems, runs at DB, peek, and post \n• \nUncovers after ball is in the air, high-point, boundary, clutch \n• \nRead step, stack, peek \n• \nDives, shoulder reduction counter, inset, tracking, digs out ball \n• \nHitch-and-go, peek, weight drop, double swat, stack, diving grab vs hit \n• \nCollege Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n70",
        "analysis": "Isaiah Bond is a WR prospect ranked highly (WR4) with a projected starting role in the NFL.  His strengths lie in his exceptional route running, particularly against man coverage, where he utilizes a diverse arsenal of releases and precise breaks.  He excels at the catch point, showing strong hands and high-pointing ability, and is a dangerous runner after the catch, possessing good vision, acceleration, and the ability to manage traffic effectively.  His comparisons to Marvin Mims (excellent at catch point and after the catch, but struggles with separation) and T.Y. Hilton (speed and elusiveness) are apt, but the profile suggests he surpasses Mims in route running and has the potential to develop into a player with the skillset of Isaac Bruce (versatility and all-around excellence).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Exceptional technique, diverse release package, precise breaks, effective against man and zone coverage.\n* **Catch Point:** Strong hands, high-pointing ability, reliable tracking, secures catches in traffic.\n* **After the Catch:** Excellent vision, acceleration, elusiveness, manages traffic well, uses acceleration to evade tackles.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Route Running:**  While excellent, addressing two specific target placement issues could elevate his game further.\n* **Increase Size:**  Lack of traditional WR1 size could limit his role in certain offensive schemes, though his skill set can compensate.\n* **Consistency:** While his catching is generally reliable, eliminating occasional lapses in hand placement will make him more consistent.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Primary:** Marvin Mims (without the route running limitations), T.Y. Hilton (speed and elusiveness)\n* **High Ceiling:** Isaac Bruce (versatility and all-around excellence)\n\n\n**Weaknesses (Implied):**\n\n* **Size:** Lacks ideal size for a traditional WR1.\n* **Durability:** High ankle sprain in 2024 suggests vulnerability.\n* **Blocking:** While he shows some effort, he is not a strong blocker.\n\nOverall, Bond projects as a high-value, high-floor prospect with significant upside. His strong route running and after-the-catch ability make him a valuable asset, and with continued development, he has the potential to become a top-end WR2 or even a WR1 depending on his continued growth and opportunity.\n"

He’s most often aligned as the \nflanker, but he also earns usage as a split end. He excels at the jump up and through, making him an asset at the \nboundary, seam routes, anywhere he can earn a contested target.  \n \nFrom a fantasy perspective, I get how it’s more appealing to have a Nico Collins type of player than whomever I used to \ncompare the smaller receivers ranked ahead of him on my board. Considering that Travis Hunter might not be a full-time \nreceiver and the two receivers I have ahead of McMillan on my board are in the same tier as McMillan, I’d have little \nargument with any placing McMillan as WR2.  \n \n\n \n71 \nFor the NFL, McMillan is the highest ranked receiver of his appealing archetype in this draft. Short-term, McMillan will have \nsome acclimation that could limit his production as a rookie.  \n \nIf McMillan is playing split end, his release game will need to be sharp against press coverage. He’ll sometimes win against \nCover-2. However, Cover-3 and press-man will be a different story.  \n \nRight now, McMillan’s releases need more craft. He has a lot of maneuvers in his toolbox, but almost none of them have the \ncontrast between patience and suddenness that beats NFL press-man.  \n \nEven against Cover-2 McMillan has allowed the cornerback to slow him down unnecessarily. He won’t win on size and length \nalone in the NFL.  \n \nMcMillan must have a better plan before the snap than he does and it should include alternatives. He’s pinned too easily at \nthe boundary because he becomes too goal-focused on sticking with a bad plan.  \nIf the leverage of a defender is different than what he planned to attack, McMillan must adjust. Otherwise, it’s a losing \nproposition.  \nWhen McMillan gets free or earns a free release, he has some effective setups, but he must begin attacking the leverage of \nhis opponents at full speed for his work to translate quickly to the NFL. The breaks he uses are precise but they lack the \nsnap to optimize separation from tight coverage.  \n \nHopefully, you’re seeing a theme here: McMillan has the tools to separate from defenders, but he’s not optimizing them. \nThis could make his life more difficult early in his career if he doesn’t execute the details that make routes sing.  \n \nSome of this difficulty earning separation has bled into his zone routes. Against shallow zone coverage, McMillan must be \nsavvier against the coverage triangle and settle between defenders rather than tempo toward the outside defender and \nwork back to the ball. He minimizes separation in this instances. He has done this against Utah and Colorado. \n \nIf McMillan didn’t have lapses with clap-attacks, he’d have an elite score as a pass catcher, and he’d be among the best \npure receivers in this class.  \nMcMillan clap-attacks a variety of targets. The core issue may have to do with him extending his hands in directions that \nrequire a significant adjustment and/or accounting for a defender. \nHe clap-attacks hitches and combines that lapse with not looking the ball all the way into his frame. This happens when he’s \ntoo focused on transitioning down-field as a ball carrier before securing the target.  \nHe’ll also clap-attack targets that require a wide extension from his frame — with or against the break. McMillan also has \nsmall clap-attacks with targets above his head but these lapses occur less frequently than the others mentioned. Still, the \nNFL magnifies bad technique and it could grow into a potential problem.  \nDespite these issues, he makes a lot of athletic plays. McMillan can take a hard hit to his back or chest as he extends over \nhis head to catch the target. He can high-point and take the wrap to his legs. McMillan can also extend away from his \nframe, take contact, and maintain possession of the ball.  \nAfter the catch, McMillan is quick enough to make the first man miss, but not sudden enough to exploit the cutback lanes he \noften spots. He attempts to exploit them when running at full speed, but often doesn’t get there in time. He’s better as a \nstop-start runner early the catch.  \nHe needs 2-3 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach to the far-side numbers. He flips his hips effectively to \nreverse field or make sharp turns away from pursuit that’s closing fast.  \nMcMillan identifies pursuit arriving from over the top or attempting to cut off his path, and he finds a way to work downhill. \nHe’s a patient open-field runner who sees cutback lanes, but lacks the suddenness to exploit the ones he identifies unless, \nin the process of avoiding a defender, he creates an open lane behind that defender.  \nMcMillan has moments where he must develop the maturity to know when to attempt a cutback and when to barrel downhill \nand use his size and strength in one-on-one scenarios. He gives up his strengths trying to get cute in the open field.  \n\n \n72 \nAt the same time, McMillan’s creativity is a strong part of his game as a ball carrier. As long as he doesn’t let his lapses \nbleed into game-script scenarios that require conservative runs, he’ll excel.  \nSo far, McMillian demonstrates a good understanding of game script scenarios. He knows when to make the first man miss \nat the boundary and get out of bounds after earning the easy yardage and stop the clock.  \nOverall, McMillan creates against unblocked defenders, showing awareness of open space, adaptability, creativity, game \nmanagement, and patience.  \nIf McMillan can upgrade his man-to-man routes from the release through the break, he could become a primary receiver \nwho earns reliable volume and generates big plays. If not, he could still have a shot to move inside and become the high-\nvolume big-slot who can also earn mismatches outside.  \nReleases: McMillan has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands hang at either \nside of his front thigh.  \nMcMillan sinks lower into his stance and comes off the line without wasted motion. When he has any lapses, he’s rocking off \nhis back foot after he sinks lower into his stance.  \nHis pads are over his knees, his head is up, and he pumps his arms with a sprinter’s gait. When facing off-coverage with a \nlot of cushion. McMillan doesn’t attack these stems at full speed. \nMcMillan attacks the leverage of his coverage. He has a two-quick release, but the move needs some craft – there’s no \ncontrast with patience and suddenness. The closest he gets to patience and suddenness is when he works the read step. \nHe’s had two releases in three games that had a patient-but-sudden quality and both were read steps.  \nMcMillan’s double-up has good range of motion with the footwork and it’s sudden but the setup with patience isn’t really \nthere. He combines a read step and double up against off-man coverage.  \nWhen releasing against press coverage, McMillan counters the defender’s hands with his. He has a sudden swat. When \nnecessary, he’ll swat and follow up with a wipe. These are counters he pairs with two-quick footwork.  \nMcMillan can get hung up on off-man coverage from the shallow CB on Cover-2. He must have a better plan to attack inside \nleverage and work outside. He tries to chop with his outside arm when he doesn’t do enough with his inside arm (a swim \nwould work) to clear the defender. This slows him down and takes him out of position to win the honey-hole shot the \nquarterback is delivering between the CB and the S.  \nMcMillan also gets hung up and jams where he has the correct counter, but he doesn’t use it with the confidence and \nviolence to shed the man. He winds up hanging onto the defender’s arm that jammed him.  \nHe’s better with a double-swat against the jam. His double-up swat to set up the slant has a violent swat.  \nWhen facing off-coverage McMillan uses the wipe with violence as he passes the shallow Cover-2 defender who reaches for \nhim. He has a shed, but the shed requires more violence.  He has a wipe/shed combo with the same arm but the violence \nisn’t there. \nWhen you uses the shed on its own, it lacks the violence to do the job and he gets hung up and pinned to the boundary. \nThe shed works for McMillan only when he’s in a two-way-go scenario.  \nMcMillan’s double swat is his most effective hand counter. He performs this well when he delivers the read step with \npatience and suddenness.  \nHe gets too goal-focused on sticking with the stem he plans in his mind rather than attacking the leverage and working back \nto the outside. As a result, he gets pinned too easily to the boundary.  \nHe’ll use a foot switch with a double swat but he overextends from the foot switch to swat and he stumbles out of the \nrelease.  \nMcMillan steals a release with a read step in the run game and it’s one of the only display of patience and suddenness I’ve \nseen with his release footwork. The only other is a stutter/duckwalk while stealing a release.  \nMcMillan has a capable blade release where he reduces the shoulder and follows up with a shed with the same arm.  \n\n \n73 \nSeparation: When he earns early separation against tight man-to-man coverage, McMillan will stack a defender. He earns \nseparation one-on-one in the intermediate and vertical ranges of the field.  \nRoute Stems: On quick slants, McMillian uses a diamond release to widen the press defender outside. He’ll also widen an \noutside shade defender on intermediate routes up the flat. He’ll accelerate into the back of the defender when the defender \nis playing off-man with a shallow cushion.  \nMcMillan dives inside to set up out-breaking routes.  \nRoute Setups: He must attack at full speed when working down the field. He sells vertical routes with a late widening of \nthe stem and a head fake or use of his eyes to sell the potential for the outside break before breaking inside.  \nMcMillan uses a stair-step setup with over routes when working from the slot against off-coverage. He’ll use a stick at the \ntop of his stems and show his eyes in the direction of the stick to sell the move against tight coverage at his back hip.  \nRoute Breaks: On short hitches, McMillan uses a long break step and drops his weight into the break. He creates a friendly \ntarget for the quarterback.  \nWhen McMillan’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to depth against this coverage on the scramble drill and then \nbreaks back to the quarterback to earn separation.  \nHis breaks on routes more than five yards from the line of scrimmage lack snap.  \nMcMillan executes tight speed breaks with a long break step, tight drive step, and flat line step. His drop and pop break to \nthe outside is effective.  \nZone Routes: Against shallow zone coverage, McMillan must be savvier against the coverage triangle and settle between \ndefenders rather than tempo toward the outside defender and work back to the ball. He minimizes separation in this \ninstances. He has done this against Utah and Colorado.  \nWhen he can get to the next level of zone, he tempos breaks well to work with his quarterback. He doesn’t show his eyes \nuntil he crosses the buzz or rollover defender.  \nMcMillan identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles in the open area.  \nRoute Boundary: McMillan is aware of the boundary on out-breaking and back-shoulder routes and toe-taps inbounds with \ndefenders tight to him.  \nPass Tracking: McMillan reaches behind his break path on shallow crosses to earn the ball. He extends for the ball at its \nearliest point with targets just above helmet level on short slants and doesn’t leave his feet. The same is true with \nintermediate out routes against zone coverage.  \nMcMillan tracks the ball over his shoulder on deep posts. He displays late hands with back-shoulder fades against tight \ncoverage.  \nHands/Catch Radius: McMillan catches targets at his chest with overhand position on slants. He extends his arms for \nunderhand attacks at his waist. He also extends his arms away from his chest when using overhand position.  \nMcMillan has lapses where he clap-attacks a variety of targets. The core issue may have to do with him extending his hands \nin directions that require a significant adjustment and/or accounting for a defender. \nHe clap-attacks hitches and combines that lapse with not looking the ball all the way into his frame. This happens he’s too \nfocused on transitioning down-field as a ball carrier before securing the target.  \nHe’ll also clap-attack that require a wide extension—with or against the break. McMillan also has small clap-attacks with \ntargets above his head but these lapses occur less frequently than the others mentioned.  \nIf McMillan didn’t have these issues, he’d have an elite score and he’d be among the best pure pass-catchers in this class.  \nPosition: McMillan can jump up and through to earn high-points against coverage that’s trailing him on routes breaking \nacross the field like a deep over or sail route. He’s effective with the pull-back against multiple defenders and embraces the \nfall while still earning two feet inbounds at the sideline.  \n\n \n74 \nMcMillan has lapses with his attack of the ball when engaging in jump up and through high-points. He uses underhand \nposition and had a lot of opportunity to use the overhand attack and pull-back from the defender. Instead, McMillan traps \nthe ball to his chest with underhand position and takes a hit to the ball and chest from the defender.  \nHe makes the catch, but this doesn’t project well at the NFL level for most receivers. \nFocus: McMillan can take a hard hit to his back or chest as he extends over his head to catch the target. He can high-point \na slant and take the wrap to his legs.  \nMcMillan can extend away from his frame, take contact, and maintain possession of the ball.  \nTransitions: McMillan catches and pierces, but he must obey the ball. When the ball is on his back shoulder he should turn \noutside. He’ll turn inside and, if he can make the inside defenders miss, he’ll work back outside.  \nElusiveness: McMillan has an effective stick and flips his hips quickly enough to avoid pursuit in the open field. He spins \nthrough contact to continue forward for extra yardage, even if he doesn’t break through the defender’s wrap.  \nHis spin is one of his better moves, especially when running at full speed and facing pursuit over the top.  \nMcMillan is quick enough to make the first man miss, but not sudden enough to exploit the cutback lanes he sees and \nattempts when running at full speed with even a moderate runway of momentum. He’s better as a stop-start guy early after \nthe catch when momentum isn’t a factor.  \nHe needs 2-3 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach to the far-side numbers. He flips his hips effectively to \nreverse field.  \nVision: McMillan identifies pursuit arriving from over the top or attempting to cut off his path, and he finds a way to work \ndownhill. He’s a patient open-field runner who sees cutback lanes but lacks the suddenness to exploit the ones he identifies \nunless in the process of avoiding a defender he creates an open lane behind that defender.  \nMcMillan has moments where he must develop the maturity to know when to attempt a cutback and when to barrel downhill \nand use his size and strength in one-on-one scenarios. He gives up his strengths trying to get cute in the open field.  \nAt the same time, McMillan’s creativity is a strong part of his game as a ball carrier. As long as he doesn’t let his lapses \nbleed into game-script scenarios that require conservative runs, he’ll excel.  \nSo far, McMillian demonstrates a good understanding game script scenarios. He knows when to make the first man miss at \nthe boundary and get out of bounds after earning the easy yardage and stop the clock.  \nOverall, McMillan creates against unblocked defenders, showing awareness of open space, adaptability, creativity, game \nmanagement, and patience.  \nPower: McMillan works through reaches to his lower legs. He has a violent stiff arm to ward off reaches or chop through \nsome wraps—even if he doesn’t maintain his balance. He pulls through cornerback wraps.  \nDirect Contact Balance: McMillan can bounce off a direct collision with a cornerback.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: McMillan bounces off hard glancing shots from safeties hitting his side and/or hip.  \nBall Security: McMillan keeps the ball high to his chest in the open field and when changing direction. Although there are \nlapses, McMillan keeps his elbow tight to his frame.  \nHe has a habit of carrying the ball under his left arm regardless which side of the field he’s at. When McMillan is at the right \nboundary, he will tuck the ball to his right arm.  \nBlocking: McMillan is a patient stalk blocker who squares his target and earns a squat position with weight drop. He’s prone \nto overextending, but he closes the gap enough that he doesn’t get too far over his knees. If he has to run to his \nassignment and cover some distance, he is more prone to overextending.  \nMcMillan attacks the defender’s chest with tight hands, but he throws jabs rather than uppercuts. He keeps his feet moving \nafter making contact.  \n\n \n75 \nHe’ll run off a defender up the boundary on running plays and tilt into the opponent, using the defender’s momentum to his \nadvantage.  \nWhen McMillan handles Most Dangerous Man assignments, he’ll work tight into the chest of the defender to deliver his \nshoulder or forearm. He earns a flat lead to earn position for his strike.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I believe there’s a substantial gap between Luther Burden III and McMillan before we \nlearn about landing spot, so I doubt I’ll be getting opportunities to draft McMillan in those leagues. The same will be true for \nyou if you follow this pre-draft ranking.  \n \nAfter the NFL Draft, McMillan’s landing spot could move him 3-4 spots up my board, but I doubt he overtakes Burden as the \ntop receiver. Still, if you believe it’s better to have the top player of a specific archetype ahead of a top option of another, \nMcMillan could be your guy. I don’t subscribe to it, but there are arguments for this belief that have merit. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \nLacking violence and aggression vs. jam \n• \nNot attacking stems at full speed, not on same page with QB vs coverage \n• \nJammed to the boundary – needs a better stem plan based on leverage.  \n• \nWhen he attacks stems with full speed, but predictable \n• \nClap-attacked slant vs. tight coverage \n• \nHigh-point and wrapped \n• \nDouble-up Stick jump up and through and one-handed grab vs DPI \n• \nJump up and through, high-point, pull back, and boundary vs. contact \n• \nWorking back to the ball    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n76",
        "analysis": "Tetairoa McMillan is a highly-ranked WR prospect (WR5) with exceptional size (6'4\", 219 lbs) and athleticism.  His game is characterized by a high-point ability and contested catch prowess, earning comparisons to Nico Collins.  However, his development is not without its challenges.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:** His height and build allow him to excel at high-pointing the ball, winning contested catches, and making plays at the boundary.  He demonstrates impressive ability to take hits and maintain possession.\n* **Contested Catch Ability:**  He is adept at securing catches in tight coverage, showcasing strength and body control.\n* **After-the-Catch Potential:** Though needing improvement in suddenness, McMillan shows flashes of elusiveness, creativity, and the ability to make defenders miss, utilizing his size to his advantage. He displays good vision and patience in the open field.\n* **Game Awareness:**  He demonstrates a good understanding of game situations, knowing when to secure yardage and stop the clock.\n* **Physicality:** He is willing to engage in physical battles with defenders, both as a receiver and a blocker.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route Running:** While possessing athletic tools, his route running needs refinement. He lacks consistent \"patience and suddenness\" in his releases, especially against press coverage.  His breaks lack snap, and he needs to better adjust to leverage changes pre-snap.  Zone route running also requires improvement.\n* **Ball Tracking:**  He experiences \"clap-attacks\" – issues with inconsistent hand placement and focus on the ball – leading to drops. This significantly impacts his overall catching efficiency.\n* **Open-Field Running:** Though showing flashes, his open-field running lacks the suddenness to consistently exploit cutback lanes. He sometimes relies too much on creativity instead of utilizing his size and strength.\n* **Release Technique:** Needs to improve the violence and consistency of his release moves against press coverage; he frequently gets jammed at the line.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Nico Collins:** This comparison highlights McMillan's size, contested catch ability, and potential as a boundary receiver.  However, Collins possesses more refined route running at this stage of his career.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nMcMillan possesses significant upside due to his physical gifts and competitive spirit.  However, his inconsistent route running and ball-tracking skills need significant improvement for him to reach his full potential.  His NFL success will hinge on the refinement of his technical skills and consistency in execution. A team focused on developing his technique could turn him into a valuable asset, but his early-career production might be limited due to these weaknesses.\n"

Higgins is near the top of the list.  \n \nIf Higgins’ hand strength were a little better when defenders swat their hands on his hands and/or the ball, Higgins would \neasily be the best pass catcher in this class. As is, he’s still an asset.  \n \n\n \n77 \nHiggins has good releases from the line that should only get better. The same is true with his setups near the top of his \nstems and breaks. His route running is effective and with only minor details to address, if at all.  \n \nThe only exception is lapses with zone coverage where Higgins doesn’t identify the defense accurately and settles into areas \nthat are not open. Once he straightens out when he should settle and when he should keep running, he’ll be fine. This \ndoesn’t happen all the time, but expect some confusion as he acclimates to a league with more complex ways of disguising \ncoverage.  \n \nAfter the catch, Higgins isn’t a dynamic runner unless he has earned the ball on the move. His creativity is limited to some \nquick stop-start movement and the ability to deliver a leg and take it away.  \nHiggins also has a hard stick to set up a lateral cut across the face of pursuit over the top. He combines it with a good head \nfake. He can make two defenders miss in tight space with his footwork, but he’s more efficient than dynamic. \nHiggins has a good feel for working against the grain of pursuit and making defenders miss so he can earn yardage with his \ncutbacks. He’ll dip downfield to press a north-south lane and bounce to the open outside crease.  \nHiggins can make multiple unblocked defenders miss in tight space to earn meaningful yardage. He also knows when a \nstraight line and splitting defenders is the best option.  \nAt his size, Higgins knows how to finish. When wrapped high, Higgins keeps his feet moving through contact. He has good \ntiming and range with his stiff arm to ward off reaches.  \nHe can drop his pads and pull through a cornerback’s wrap to his torso. He can also carry a cornerback on his back, \ndiscarding the defender as he turns the corner.  \nIf paired with an excellent quarterback, Higgins could become an excellent possession-plus option like Tee Higgins and Mike \nWilliams. His game is a mix of these two—not as fluid as Tee but not as powerful as Williams. Still a promising mix.  \n \nReleases: Higgins has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front leg. The arms hang at either \nside of the front knee. Higgins sinks into his stance and comes off the line with no wasted motion.  \nWhen he has lapses with wasted motion, there’s a slight rock off the back foot while rolling off the front foot.  \nHiggins will set up a release as a blocker stalking the cornerback and once he closes, he delivers a swat-wipe combo to work \npast into the honey hole of Cover 2.  \nHiggins uses a hip shift at the top of his stem. He has a two-quick off the line, and he’ll use it to steal a release in the run \ngame. He’ll also counter it with a wipe, although he gets hung up from a defender’s jam.  \nHe uses a foot-switch or sudden read step off the line to release inside. He uses a double-up at the top of the stem on a \nspeed out.   \nHiggins’ read step has a patient, but sudden quality. He also combines it well with a sudden double up. He counters hands \nwith a violent shed. His stick also has a patient, but sudden execution and when he turns the coverage’s hips with it, he \ntakes the back of the defender.  \nHiggins counters the hands of a defender inside of him with a shed. He’ll set up a throw-by with a shed, although the throw-\nby is really more of a push-off.  \nHe’ll also reduce the shoulder from defenders shooting their hands from an outside shade position.  \nHiggins uses a lean-in to set up breaks inside against outside-shade coverage, but he must snap the break and earn a \nflatter break with his drive and line steps.  \nHe has a violent stick with an inset at the top of stems against off-coverage. He has a subtle peek at the top of stems on \nvertical routes. He could emphasize this more.  \nHiggins hesitation and two-quick are a good combination for vertical routes. He uses the two-quick and counters with a \nshed.  \n\n \n78 \nHe has a capable swim when in tight coverage with a defender in a tight position.  \nSeparation: Higgins’ patient but sudden hesitation leads to separation on vertical stems in the intermediate and vertical \nranges of the field.  \nHe will stack a cornerback on a vertical route within 12-15 yards.  \nRoute Stems: Higgins will dive inside to set up a teammate’s route on the same side of the field against the shallow zone. \nHe attacks leverage at full speed.  \nRoute Setups: Higgins takes the back of the defender playing off coverage to set up a three-step break. He’ll run at the \ndefender playing off coverage on an intermediate route to set up the vertical potential of the break but then break \ninside/outside.  \nHiggins will sell the fade or out with a peek to set up the double move to the go route. He’ll stair-step a break inside and \nback to the quarterback.  \nRoute Breaks: Higgins has a drop-and-pop break. His speed break has a flat drive step. His line step can be a little flatter \nwith intermediate breaks. His line step is flatter on shallow speed outs. He executes speed outs with a good pace.  \nHiggins has a long break step with weight drop at the top of his stem on short hitches. His weight drop isn’t sudden and \nthere’s no acceleration into the break. In contrast, his three-step break has good weight drop.  \nHiggins’ turns with short breaks need more snap. His turns with breaks long than five yards downfield have snap.  \nHe’ll work toward an open area against man coverage when the initial break doesn’t earn a target.  \nZone Routes: Higgins will tempo breaks between zone defenders on vertical routes. He turns his head to the quarterback \nafter clearing the buzz defender.  \nHiggins also settles into open zones after identifying the second-level defender. There are some zones where he doesn’t \nread the triangle effectively enough and he tempos across a zone when he should settle – especially after he has turned to \nlook at the quarterback and the quarterback is breaking the pocket.  \nRoute Boundary: Higgins can tap and drag off a high-point against tight coverage. He can also toe-tap as he backs his \nway toward the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Higgins can track the ball over his shoulder with underhand position tight to his frame. He also tracks \ndirectly over his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: He can attack with overhand position at the numbers and at the earliest point. He can make a later \nturn behind his break path and catch the ball with overhand position. He digs out low throws with underhand position \nextended from his frame and even below his knees while remaining in a balanced position.  \nPosition: Higgins will embrace the fall when extending away from his frame to catch the football. He can jump up and \nthrough over the top of a defender.  \nFocus: Higgins can go airborne for a less-accurate target and take a hit to his chest on the way down. He can pull the ball \naway from a defender in his chest on a jump up and through. Higgins can make catches at his numbers or beltline when \nworking across the field with a defender tight to his back. He can extend through the break path for the ball and take a hard \nshot to his chest.  \nIf his hand strength were better when defenders swat their hands on his hands and/or the ball, Higgins would easily be the \nbest pass catcher in this class.  \nTransitions: Higgins can show more awareness of coverage over the top so he transitions away from a defender rather \nthan into him. Even so, he adheres to catch-and-pierce principles.  \nElusiveness: Higgins has some quick stop-start movement and the ability to deliver a leg and take it away. He also has a \nhard stick to set up a lateral cut across the face of pursuit over the top. He combines it with a good head fake.  \nHe can make two defenders miss in tight space with his footwork.  \n\n \n79 \nVision: Higgins has a good feel for working against the gain of pursuit and making defenders miss so he can earn yardage \nwith his cutbacks. He’ll dip downfield to press a north-south lane and bounce to the open outside crease.  \nHiggins can make multiple unblocked defenders miss in tight space to earning meaningful yardage. He also knows when a \nstraight line and splitting defenders is the best option.  \nPower: When wrapped high, Higgins keeps his feet moving through contact. He has good timing and range with his stiff \narm to ward off reaches.  \nHiggins pulls through multiple light reaches. I would say the reaches don’t even qualify as legitimate tackle attempts. He \ncan drop his pads and pull through a cornerback’s wrap to his torso. He can also carry a cornerback on his back, discarding \nthe defender as he turns the corner.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He’ll drop his pads into an oncoming cornerback and generate a push.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Higgins bounces off glancing shots to his legs and side from safeties with momentum into the \nhit. He has an effective balance-touch.  \nBall Security: Higgins tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm and high to his chest. His elbow is loose from his side. \nHe can take contact to the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlocking: Higgins identifies Most Dangerous Man assignments and works downfield to the defender. He gets a flat enough \nlead to square the defender and does so with a squat stance.  \nHiggins loses patience with his stalk on Man Over Me assignments. He begins his approach with a square and squat position \nbut when he gets within 3-4 yards, he rushes and overextends rather than allowing the defender to come to him cut off the \ndefender’s path with balanced and controlled movement.  \nWhen he’s patient enough with his approach, he doesn’t close the gap as tight as he could, but he is close enough to shoot \nhis hands with tight position to the chest and elbows bent. He doesn’t uppercut and roll through the hips with a true punch. \nHe keeps his feet moving after establishing contact.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you’re seeking the receivers who offer the best chances to deliver first-year production \nin the NFL, McMillan is likely the last strong bet on the list. Higgins has a shot because he’s a reliable pass catcher with size \nand speed and his release packages are just good enough that he could acclimate fast enough to a full-time role.  \n \nHiggins is a second-round rookie pick before the NFL conducts his draft. He might slide to the early part of the third round in \nsome formats, but not much further.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nTracking, Late Hands, Behind Break Point, Pull-Back, Hit \n• \nJump Up and Through, Tight Coverage, Boundary \n• \nEarliest Window and Contact Balance \n• \nStair-Step and Snap of Break \n• \nOne-Handed Snap Away from Frame, Boundary  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n80",
        "analysis": "## Jayden Higgins: Player Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:**  Higgins' 6'4\", 214-pound frame and excellent hands make him a highly effective target, especially in tight coverage. He excels at securing the ball in contested situations, displaying impressive body control and ability to adjust to poorly thrown passes.  He demonstrates consistent high-pointing ability and can make catches at various points on his body (numbers, beltline).\n* **Route Running:** Possesses solid route-running skills with effective releases and precise breaks, particularly on vertical routes.  His patient yet sudden hesitation creates separation, especially in the intermediate and vertical ranges. His route stems are well-executed, and he shows a good understanding of how to attack leverage.  While some improvement is needed in reading zone coverages, his fundamentals are strong.\n* **After the Catch:** Though not exceptionally dynamic, Higgins shows good contact balance and elusiveness for his size. He's adept at using a hard stick, head fakes, and cutbacks to create extra yardage, making multiple defenders miss at times. He displays excellent power and balance while maintaining his feet through contact, using stiff arms and effective pad level to break tackles. He finishes plays effectively, even when taking hits.\n* **Reliable Hands:**  Higgins boasts a very high catch percentage, displaying consistency and reliability even when facing pressure.  His hand strength, while a potential area for improvement, is already notable; the evaluator believes improved hand strength would catapult him to the top of his class.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Zone Coverage Recognition:** Higgins needs improvement in identifying and reacting to zone coverages.  He sometimes settles into areas that aren't open, a problem that should improve with NFL-level coaching and experience.\n* **Hand Strength:** While already good, improving hand strength, especially in resisting defender swats, would significantly elevate his game and make him a more dominant receiver.\n* **Post-Catch Explosiveness:** While capable, Higgins isn't exceptionally dynamic after the catch. Developing more explosive run-after-catch abilities would significantly increase his value.\n* **Blocking:** While he identifies assignments effectively, his technique needs refinement for more consistent and impactful blocking.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe profile explicitly compares Higgins to **Tee Higgins** and **Mike Williams**. He's seen as a blend of the two: not as fluid as Tee Higgins but not as powerfully built as Mike Williams.  This suggests a receiver with a good mix of size, reliable hands, and route-running ability, capable of being a valuable possession receiver in the NFL.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nJayden Higgins projects as a high-potential second-round pick with a strong likelihood of making an impact early in his NFL career.  His size, reliable hands, and solid route running make him an attractive prospect, and addressing the opportunities for improvement could turn him into a star player.\n"

I wonder if they believe that’s a legitimizing \nfactor that will appeal to fans who logo-scout players. I’ll broach the folly of logo scouting with another TCU prospect a little \nlater.  \n \nBech had a breakout season in 2024 as a well-built possession receiver with better short-area explosion than long speed. \nHis short-area quickness, acceleration, and footwork makes him a promising option at the line of scrimmage who can defeat \npress coverage with his movement and size. Additional work with refining his footwork so he’s using pacing to bait his \nopponent will help him reach that goal.  \n \n\n \n81 \nBech has a pair of effective route setups against off-man coverage. His breaks back to the quarterback are sudden and his \nbeaks inside and outside have sharpness.  \n \nBech is a reliable pass-catcher who wins the ball away from his frame and uses optimal attack positions to do so. He can \ntake hits and win targets in tight coverage.  \n \nThe one area of his receiving game that needs work is his positioning with back-shoulder targets and underthrown passes. \nBech tips off his intentions and loses the opportunity to establish favorable position.  \n \nReleases: Bech has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang straight at \neither side of his front knee.  \nBech sinks into his stance when he begins his release from the line of scrimmage. He rocks off the back foot before rolling \noff the front foot when he sinks into his stance. He has reps where he eliminates this wasted motion of the rock, but he \ndoesn’t sink as deeply as he should. His pads cover over his knees and he comes off the line with his head up.  \nBech uses a feet-switch at the line to set up a release outside or inside man coverage. He counters the defender’s hands \nwith a wipe.  \nBech uses a stick to attack leverage inside and release outside. He has a swat-swim combination but uses the opposite \nhands for each move than what you’d expect based on the location of the defender and it might limit the effectiveness of \nthe combination. This happens against inside leverage. He uses a more traditional swat-swim combo at the top of breaks \nagainst coverage playing outside leverage.  \nBech uses a swat to work past a defender at his inside hip when releasing outside. He reduces his shoulder at the top of \nstems against off coverage. Bech uses a shed to counter defenders shooting their hands when he releases inside.  \nBech also uses a feet-switch to steal a release. He’ll also use a pair of hesitations. At the top of his stems he has a two-\nquick to set up an outside break. He also uses a hip shift at the top of stems to set up an inside break against off-coverage.  \nBech uses a read step to attack outside leverage. His hesitation and read step combo has patience and suddenness. He \nmust cultivate this pacing artistry with other releases.  \nBech decelerates well when he uses a long break step in the open field as a runner to force pursuit to overrun its angle. \nHe’ll also duck under the contact as he’s making the break step. He flips his hips efficiently and suddenly to get inside or \noutside.  \nBech has effective jump cuts to avoid pursuit inside, outside, or over the top. He only needs one step to transition downhill \nfrom an east-west runway.  \nAfter the catch Bech can create in open space against multiple unblocked defenders with patience, decisiveness, and \nwisdom. He has good peripheral vision with backside pursuit.  \nWhen contact is imminent, Bech has good placement with his stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He keeps his feet \nmoving when wrapped at the waist or above, dragging defensive backs downfield before falling forward. He’ll lead with his \npads to attack cornerbacks when finishing in the open field.  \nBech can run through multiple reaches and win yards after a collision. He can also keep his feet and buy time for \nteammates to help him push through multiple wraps for additional yardage.  \nBech is about the same level of talent as Michael Wilson of the Cardinals, but he’s not as refined of a route runner. His \nhealth history is better.  \nSeparation: As a route runner or a ball carrier, Bech can sustain the separation he earns against safeties.  \nRoute Stems: Bech will dive inside to work away from the shallow Cover 2 defender. He’ll widen an outside defender and \nwork into his back to set up a break back to the quarterback.  \nRoute Setups: Bech will stair-step a sail route. He’ll set up the post or seam with a peek to the boundary at the top of his \nstems against off-coverage. Bech has a capable inset to bait a high safety downhill after Bech dives inside with his stem.  \n\n \n82 \nRoute Breaks: When running shallow speed breaks, Bech has a long break step and flat drive and line steps. He snaps his \nturns with a good punch of the boundary-side arm. He gets his head around fast and runs out the break with a friendly \ntarget to the quarterback.  \nBech also uses a long break step to set up a three-step break with weight drop. He uses this break at the boundary with in-\ncuts that also have a flat drive and flat line step.  \nBech has a sudden drop and pop break—even when he doesn’t drop his weight. He snaps the turn and works back to the \nquarterback. Bech can drop his weight into the drop and pop after delivering a long break step. \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Bech works with the quarterback to find an open space.  \nZone Routes: Bech identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks between zone defenders or \nthrottles down into the open area with a friendly target. This depends on the route.  \nWhen working vertical breaks against zone coverage, Bech waits to show his eyes until he has passed the rollover/buzz \ndefender.  \nRoute Boundary: Bech toe-taps the boundary on out routes that he tracks over his shoulder.  \nPass Tracking: Bech attacks targets at his numbers at the earliest available window of arrival. He tracks the ball over his \nshoulder with coverage bearing down on deep posts. He can also make a full extension for the ball high and over his \nshoulder.  \nBech tips off back-shoulder fades, looking for the ball too soon after the break and not running to depth and earning jump \nup and through position first.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Bech catches targets at the numbers and shoulders with overhand position. Bech uses underhand \nattack for targets arriving below his chest. He extends his arms to attack away from his frame.  \nBech high-points effectively and transitions downhill with a good retraction of the ball as he’s doing so. He also digs out low \ntargets below his knees.  \nThe biggest issue with Bech’s technique is that he attacks with his hands too far apart when using overhand attack. This \nleads to juggling the ball and drops due to clap-attacks.  \nPosition: Bech’s jump up and through positioning must happen earlier on back-shoulder plays so he can get his back to the \ndefender before attacking the ball. He embraces the fall when making full extensions for a target.  \nBech has an effective pull back when tracking vertical routes over his shoulder against tight coverage. He must cultivate this \nwhen executing jump up and through positioning and other positions at the catch point.  \nFocus: Bech can take a hit to his chest and the ball as he secures a slant over the middle or a deep post with a linebacker \ntrailing him close. He can take contact to his back while securing a target.  \nBech works tight passing lanes effectively, catching the ball in small windows where he gets hit in the back and chest during \nthe play. He can get ping-ponged with hits to his chest in succession and maintain possession of the ball.  \nTransitions: Bech must be more vigilant with obeying the path of the ball on hitches and curls so he can maximize his \ngains when he catches and pierces downhill. He chooses the path with the least number of defenders, but these paths also \noffer the most boom-bust potential for yardage.  \nElusiveness: Bech decelerates well when he uses a long break step in the open field as a runner to force pursuit to overrun \nits angle. He’ll also duck under the contact as he’s making the break step. He flips his hips efficiently and suddenly to get \ninside or outside.  \nBech has effective jump cuts to avoid pursuit inside, outside, or over the top. He only needs one step to transition downhill \nfrom an east-west runway.  \nVision: Bech can create in open space against multiple unblocked defenders with patience, decisiveness, and wisdom—\nwhen he’s not transitioning after the catch. He has good peripheral vision with backside pursuit.  \n\n \n83 \nPower: Bech has good placement with his stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He keeps his feet moving when \nwrapped at the waist or above, dragging defensive backs downfield before falling forward. He’ll lead with his pads to attack \ncornerbacks when finishing in the open field.  \nBech can run through multiple reaches and win yards after a collision. He can also keep his feet and buy time for \nteammates to help him push through multiple wraps for additional yardage. Bech can run through wraps to his lower body \nfrom cornerbacks.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Bech stalemates direct shots from safeties immediately after transitioning downhill from the catch \npoint. He can run over a cornerback.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Bech bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks when both have momentum into the \ncollision. He can bounce off a hard glancing shot to his side and shoulder from a linebacker who has the momentum.  \nBall Security: Bech tucks the ball high to his chest and can take a hit to the ball and ball-carrying arm. He can take hard \nswats from backside pursuit to his ball carrying arm. When he catches a target working outside the left hash, he’ll tuck the \nball to his left arm.  \nBlocking: As a stalk blocker, Bech shuffles his feet toward the Man Over Me assignment with knees bent in a squat stance. \nHe’s patient with his approach once he gets within two yards of the defender, allowing the defender to initiate the contact \nand then countering the defender’s movement so he can earn position and drive the defender away from the ball carrier.  \nBech closes the gap effectively, earns the correct shoulder of the defender, and generates a push with good hand position \nand footwork.  \nBech is also patient with his approach on Most Dangerous Man assignments against safeties. He’ll earn a flat lead to cut off \nthe defender’s path to the ball carrier. If he has to work toward a high safety, he loses patience and declares a position too \nearly, tipping off the defender.  \nBech transitions from route runner to blocker when his quarterback breaks the pocket. Despite the hands position and the \nstance, Bech doesn’t sustain blocks long enough when the assignment isn’t taking place at the line of scrimmage.  \nDurability: Played only eight games in 2023 due to a knee injury. Camp injury in 2022—shin splints.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Bech could thrive in a slot-flanker role in the NFL. There are enough talents in the league \nwith his skills that Beck might be waiting behind a receiver for 1-2 years before he gets his shot.  \n \nDraft capital and landing spot could change his rookie draft value significantly. Before the NFL Draft, Bech is a nice third-\nround pick. If he lands somewhere with an immediate opportunity to start, he could be a second-round value. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nWidens and Takes Back of CB, Break Step, Snap, Works to QB, Attacks Early, Stiff Arm \n• \nWidens Stem, Peek, Tracking, Catch vs. Contact \n• \nTipping off Back Shoulder Fade and Miss-Timing Jump Up and Through \n• \nDeceleration and Duck Under, Ball Security, and Finish \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n84",
        "analysis": "Jack Bech is a well-built (6'1\", 214 lbs) possession receiver who excels in short-area quickness, acceleration, and footwork.  His strengths lie in his ability to defeat press coverage, win at the catch point, and make plays after the catch. He's a reliable pass catcher who can take hits and maintain possession, even in tight coverage.  His route running shows sharpness in breaks and setups, particularly against off-man coverage.  He's also a capable blocker, especially as a stalk blocker.\n\nHowever, Bech needs improvement in his back-shoulder fade routes and handling underthrown passes, often tipping off his intentions.  His hand placement when making overhand catches needs refinement to reduce drops.  While he shows promise as a run-after-catch player, his transitions after the catch sometimes lack efficiency.  His blocking consistency is also an area needing work outside of the line of scrimmage. His injury history (knee and shin splints) presents a risk.\n\nNFL Player Comparisons:  Michael Wilson (Cardinals) and Josh Palmer are cited as similar players.  Bech is considered comparable to Wilson in talent level but is less refined as a route runner, while possessing a better health history.  The comparison suggests a player with similar size and potential but perhaps requiring more time to develop polished route-running skills.\n\nOpportunities: Bech's success in the NFL depends heavily on draft capital and landing spot. A team with an immediate need at receiver could make him a second-round value, while a less opportune situation might push him to the third round or later.  He could thrive in a slot-flanker role, but he might need a year or two to fully develop and claim a significant role.\n"

Unfortunately, Akharaiyi suffered an undisclosed injury to begin the year and \nstruggled through the rest of the season.  \nOne strong season from a smaller program isn’t the stuff that catches the eyes of NFL decision makers. The skills \nAkharaiyi’s tape displayed at Mississippi State and UTEP is better than the box score.  \n \n\n \n85 \nAkharaiyi has patient, but sudden release packages against man coverage, and he delivers his hands with violence. He \ncombines his moves efficiently and when he earns separation, he stacks defenders at every range of the field to control the \nroute.  \n \nAkharaiyi also uses pacing effectively when setting up routes. He knows when to attack at full speed and when to slow the \npace. Akharaiyi also executes breaks with precision  \n \nThese skills make Akharaiyi a promising route runner against man coverage and his understanding of the triangle of \ndefenders near his route make him a promising player against zone. He works well with the quarterback when the first \nbreak doesn’t earn a target.  \n \nHe shines as a pass catcher. Akharaiyi makes athletic adjustments to win the ball and also understands how to position \nhimself optimize his pass-catching against tight coverage. He’s a tough and acrobatic ball-winner in traffic with excellent \ntracking ability.  \n \nAkharaiyi is also an adept runner after the catch. He has a healthy toolbox of moves and knows how to get his feet over the \nlow shots of defenders in pursuit. He has contact balance against larger defenders and finishes strong.  \n \nAkharaiyi’s struggles at Mississippi State will drop him below preseason draft radar but if any scouts and personnel directors \nstudy at least two years of tape, they’ll see the talent worthy of a UDFA contract.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Probably best suited for a flanker, but might have the ceiling to play split end, too.  \nReleases: Akharaiyi has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His hands rest close \ntogether at the front knee. He often rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front foot. There are enough routes where \nhe sinks into his stance without rocking off the back foot that this is a minor issue Akharaiyi can clean up with his game and \nwithout significant issue.   \nAkharaiyi will sell the vertical potential of the route with his pads over his knees and pumping his arms at full range of \nmotion. He doesn’t do this with every route, but he does it well on curls against off coverage.  \nAkharaiyi has a two-quick release to steal a release or a two-quick and a stick combo. He has a read step to set up outside \nleverage and counter the defender’s hands with a shed, swim, or wipe. His swat-swim counter is explosive.  \nHe uses a double up and swat combination to steal a release. He also uses a trigger step and a double up. He has a patient \nhesitation and a sudden two-quick to get outside tight coverage while stealing a release.  \nAkharaiyi also pairs a two-quick with a wipe. His stutter release is effective against off coverage to set up a vertical route. \nHe uses the two-quick against tight coverage and show his eyes inside during it to suck the defender inside and then \nrelease outside.  \nHe has a quick double up and he’ll counter the defender’s hands with a shoulder reduction. He can combine the shoulder \nreduction and the shed into a blade release.  \nAkharaiyi combines a hesitation with a double up. He performs it with a patient and sudden combination.  \nSeparation: Akharaiyi stacks defenders with vertical stems in the intermediate, vertical, and deep ranges of the field.  \nRoute Stems: Akharaiyi widens stems to set up his breaks inside against outside leverage. He dives to set up inside \nleverage. He attacks stems at full speed, especially when diving or widening. He’ll run at the defender and counter the \ndefender’s hands at the top of the stem with a shoulder reduction.  \nRoute Setups: Akharaiyi delivers an inset at the top of stems to the inside as a setup for an outside break. He can stair-\nstep in-breaking routes. He’ll use a nice pace change to set up a flat defender and go deep on the man on schemed plays \nwhere he acts as a lead blocker than then changes the pace to accelerate downhill.  \nAkharaiyi drops his weight effectively into double moves like stutter-and-go. He’ll take the back hip of the defender and \nattack the stem at full speed to set up a curl or hitch.  \nRoute Breaks: Akharaiyi has a long break step and transitions into a three-step break with weight drop. He finishes with a \nfriendly target to the quarterback.  \nHis speed breaks have a sharp and flat drive step and flat line step. He gets his head around to the quarterback. He also \nworks back to the ball.  \n\n \n86 \nAkharaiyi can run a sharp and sudden drop and pop break with good weight drop and work back to the ball out of the break.  \nZone Routes: Akharaiyi tempos his breaks between zone defenders and in open space, and looks to the quarterback when \nhe’s ready for the ball. He works back to the quarterback or an open area when his first break doesn’t earn the target. He \nalso settles into the open area between the zone triangle.  \nRoute Boundary: Akharaiyi can lean toward the boundary while tracking directly over his head and drag both feet \ninbounds. \nPass Tracking: Akharaiyi tracks targets over his back shoulder and address the target at the earliest point with overhand \nattack. He can make a leaping grab for a target arriving over his shoulder. He displays late hands at the catch point. He can \ntrack the ball directly over his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Akharaiyi can high-point to his outside shoulder when he was looking for the ball from his inside \nshoulder. He can catch targets at his waist with underhand attack. He also catches targets below his knees and can dig out \nlow throws.  \nPosition: Akharaiyi can embrace the fall after a leaping catch. Akharaiyi can perform a jump up and through with an \noverhand high-point and pull-back against tight coverage  \nFocus: Akharaiyi catches targets at his waist with underhand position, taking a hit to his side as he does so. He can take a \nhard hit to the chest as he retracts a high-point target.  \nTransitions: Akharaiyi uses catch and pierce principles and obeys the direction of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Akharaiyi has adept movement with stutter steps, stop-starts, dips, and spins. He also kicks his feet over the \nreaches of defenders. He only needs 1-2 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter run. I’d have him ranked higher if the \ntransition I saw was a 90-degree turn. It was close but not there.  \nAkharaiyi has an explosive stick to set up alleys inside. He counters the defender’s reach with a stiff arm.  \nVision: Akharaiyi is a decisive runner who attacks downhill and finds open space. He’ll split defenders when it’s the best \npotential choice.  \nHe can create in the open field when there are 3-4 unblocked defenders and no help for him. I didn’t see him run any plays \nin three years where he could demonstrate patience as a runner but I would expect he has it even if I can’t score it.  \nPower: Akharaiyi uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches. He pulls through reaches to his frame. Akharaiyi keeps his feet \nmoving through contact and can pull/push defensive backs downfield while they wrap him high. He also has a capable \nbalance-touch.  \nDirect Contact Balance: I didn’t see any instances of direct collisions in three years of tape. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Akharaiyi bounces off glancing shots from linebackers.  \nBall Security: Akharaiyi tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm and high to his chest. He can take contact to the ball. \nHowever, his elbow is often loose from his side and the right contact can knock the ball free.  \nBlocking: Akharaiyi extends his arms into the chest of the defender with tight hands. He keeps his feet moving. He can \nlatch onto the chest plate and he’s the aggressor with Man Over Me assignments, and he sustains his efforts. His hands are \nstrong enough to withstand shed attempts from corners and regain his position to run the defender out of the play.  \nAkharaiyi will set up force defenders to earn position as the runner makes his way to the perimeter and then takes the \noutside shoulder and forces the defender away from the ball carrier. He can also work inside-out on the force player and \nseal him to the outside.  \nAkharaiyi earns as square and squat stance with his legs wide to address Most Dangerous Man assignments. He’ll run off a \ndefender, tilt into him at the top of his route, and drive the defender away from a path to the ball carrier.  \nDurability: Dealt with an undisclosed injury in 2024 that limited his effectiveness.  \n \n\n \n87 \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Not many UDFAs become starting receivers because of the privileges of draft capital and \nthe legitimate talent of early-round selections, but Akharaiyi is worth monitoring. If he becomes a camp darling heading into \nAugust, he’ll be worth acquiring for expanded dynasty rosters during the fantasy preseason.  \n \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDives stem, shows eyes at right time vs. zone, extension over shoulder, embraces fall \n• \nHigh-point vs. Contact to Chest/Side \n• \nShoulder Reduction-Two-Quick-Go-Tight-Coverage \n• \nTwo-Quick, Shows Eyes Inside, Release Outside, Stack, Catch Over Shoulder \n• \nTrack Directly Over the Head Lean toward Boundary, Drags Feet \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n88",
        "analysis": "Kelly Akharaiyi is a wide receiver prospect with a high ceiling but whose draft stock has been negatively impacted by an injury-plagued season at Mississippi State.  He possesses exceptional route-running skills, particularly against man coverage, showcasing patient yet sudden releases, precise breaks, and effective pacing. He's a strong, acrobatic ball-winner in traffic with excellent tracking ability and solid after-the-catch potential.  His blocking skills are also noteworthy, showing aggression and technique in pass protection.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Route Running:**  Displays a sophisticated understanding of route concepts, including effective use of stems, breaks, and pace changes to create separation.  His release package is varied and effective against both man and zone coverage.\n* **Strong Hands and Catch Radius:**  Excellent at high-pointing the ball, making athletic adjustments to secure catches, and effectively catching the ball in traffic.\n* **After-the-Catch Ability:**  Possesses a diverse set of moves and good contact balance, making him a threat to gain yards after the catch.\n* **Blocking:** Shows surprising strength and technique in his blocking, particularly in pass protection.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Consistency:** Needs to demonstrate consistency in performance. His injury-shortened season at Mississippi State raises concerns about durability and overall consistency.\n* **Showcase Durability:** Recovering fully from his undisclosed injury and proving his long-term durability is crucial for his NFL prospects.\n* **Increase Production:** Needs to translate his skills into consistently high production numbers to further convince NFL scouts.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Roddy White/DeAndre Hopkins - This comparison highlights his combination of route-running precision (White) and contested catch ability (Hopkins).  However,  consistent high-level production needs to be demonstrated to truly reach this comparison.  The comparison also suggests he might be best suited as an X receiver.\n\n\n**Overall:** Akharaiyi is a talented receiver with a promising skillset. However, his injury and inconsistent production in 2024 have significantly impacted his draft prospects. He's likely a priority free agent who could develop into a valuable contributor in the NFL, particularly if he addresses his durability concerns and consistently showcases his skills.\n"

He’s a flanker or \nfuture slot receiver whose best work is in open space.  \nMatch Egbuka with linear routes that work across the field at a variety of depths, and he can deliver a lot of production \nbecause of his value as a runner after the catch. Ask Egbuka to spend most of his time working timing routes against tight \nman-to-man coverage, win consistently at the boundary, and earn contested catches, and there’s potential for \ndisappointment.  \n\n \n89 \nThis is the difference between Egbuka’s game belonging on the continuum of Puka Nacua’s and having Nacua’s skills and \ntalents. Egbuka game is in the same city, but not the same neighborhood.  \nEgbuka opts for the wrong attack of targets and allows the ball into his frame when there’s no need to do so. He’s often \nunprepared to use the correct attack for targets that aren’t pinpoint accurate, but reasonably catchable.  \nThis behavior impacts his effectiveness with targets against tight coverage and contested plays requiring athletic \nadjustments. These targets occur most often against man coverage, timing routes, and plays at the boundary.  \nEgbuka’s timing routes lack sharp detail at the break point. It leads him to drift out of breaks and gives good cover corners \nthe angle to break up targets.  \nEgbuka will thrive as an outlet receiver who catches short passes in space and wins intermediate and deep targets on \nslower-developing routes across the middle of the field. Yes, he’ll have some victories with timing routes and contested \nplays on vertical routes, but it’s likely you’ll see his share of struggles there, too.  \nWith continued work, Egbuka might find himself in the Nacua’s neighborhood of skills. Right now? That’s a projection.  \nAlthough this receiver class has a lowly perception relative to recent classes, there are still players in this group who have \ngreater versatility and refinement with their game who can deliver immediately at a high level. Egbuka can do so in a \nrestricted role – and with an ideal fit, he might produce like a starter – but that doesn’t make him as valuable until we see \nthat fit. \nEven if the fit is promising, there’s refinement ahead that could slow his statistical rise to fantasy prominence.  \nReleases: Egbuka begins with a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His arms hang at \neither side of his front leg and the hands are uncrossed. He rolls off the front foot without wasted motion. His pads are over \nhis knees and he sells the vertical with that position and his arms drumming like a sprinter out of the blocks.  \nHe uses a wipe to counter the hands of off coverage at the top of his stem. He has an effective double up to set up breaks \nto the inside.  \nEgbuka’s two-quicks with a swat-swim counter is effective against press coverage. He uses a hesitation to steal a release on \nrunning plays.  \nEgbuka will use a one-stem stretch to attack the leverage of an off-coverage defender and then counter the defender’s \nhands with a wipe or a shed. He’ll also use a hard stick.  \nEgbuka reduces his shoulder from a flat defender playing shallow inside shade in zone.  \nSeparation: Egbuka has the speed to beat cornerbacks on vertical routes and he will stack them.  \nRoute Stems: Egbuka will dive inside or widen outside to attack the leverage of zone defenders.  \nRoute Setups: Egbuka will accelerate toward the defender at the top of the stem to set up the three-step break. He’ll stair-\nstep stems to set up breaks. He also peeks at the top of stems to influence coverage.  \nWhen given the defender’s back during a stem, he’ll attack the back hip to set up his breaks. Egbuka sells the inset with \nexcellent detail and length against the high safety on a deep over route.  \nRoute Breaks: His pop-and-drop is effective with short routes. He also has an effective one-long, three-quick with weight \ndrop into the break step.  \nEgbuka’s speed breaks have a sharp drive step. His line step can be a lot flatter but the next step after is flat. He doesn’t \nsnap his turns on these breaks. He rounds off too many speed breaks.  \nAs a senior, Egbuka’s speed breaks on shallow routes have flat drive and line steps. There is more snap to his turns and \nhe’s punching the boundary-side arm to make it happen. His intermediate speed turns still drift because the line step isn’t \nflat enough and he’s giving up room for a trailing cornerback to win the ball—regardless of the accuracy of the target.  \nHe finishes friendly with his chest and eyes facing the quarterback and breaks toward the target.  \n\n \n90 \nZone Routes: Egbuka will work to an open area after his first break doesn’t earn a target. He’ll identify the second-level \ndefender, work to depth, and throttle down to the open spot. \nHe’ll also tempo breaks across the window of the zone. He waits until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender to show his \neyes.  \nEgbuka should snap his turns on routes under shallow zones.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary, but must work on dragging the feet to get both inbounds when high-\npointing a target breaking toward the sideline. Egbuka can toe-tap near the sideline and get inbounds when turning away \nfrom his break path and catching a target that demands a full extension of his arms.   \nPass Tracking: He tracks the ball effectively over his shoulder as well as behind his back shoulder while still breaking \ndownhill. He leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at his chest where he’s using underhand attack.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Egbuka can catch the ball at thigh level working away from the ball with underhand position. He can \nextend fully with underhand position to earn the ball. He high-points effectively.  \nHe has lapses with attack position, using underhand position with targets arriving at chest and shoulder height. He’s not \nprepared to use the correct attack when targets arrive behind his anticipated break path, and he has dropped balls because \nof it. Even as a senior, he opts for underhand attack and allowing the ball into his frame when he has every reason to attack \nat the earliest point and gain a step as a runner.  \nWhen he can turn toward the vertical route target, he can extend his hands overhand to attack at the earliest point while \nstill on the move downhill. He also digs out low targets thrown behind him with sliding catches.  \nPosition: Egbuka passes up opportunities to execute jump up and through positioning for keeping his back to the defender \nand tracking targets over his shoulder and difficult angles. He can make the catch.  \nEgbuka executes pull-backs against trail coverage when catching the ball over his shoulder.  \nFocus: He can take a hit to the chest or back while catching over his shoulder with underhand position. He can take hits to \nhis back while attacking the ball at its earliest point with underhand position, even if he has lapses with attack position he \nshould correct.  \nEgbuka can take hard shots to his back as he catches the ball with overhand position away from his chest.  \nTransitions: Egbuka has tight catch-and-pierce transitions downhill. When specific routes dictate him to obey the trajectory \nof the ball with his transitions, he’ll turn downhill in the direction that the ball was placed.  \nElusiveness: Egbuka gets his feet high enough to work over low shots from pursuit in the open field. He’ll spin to attempt \nto pull away from wraps. His stick is sharp. \nHe has curvilinear movement to bend around pursuit and weave into open alleys. He can use it at top speed or deliver \ntransition at the boundary on a run to the far sideline and transition downhill with two small steps without losing much \nspeed at all.  \nVision: Egbuka can press lanes and weave his way through tight creases so he can earn open field. He can attack downhill \nwith excellent pace to set up his cutbacks with a blocker.  \nPower: Egbuka will split defenders in the open field and finish plays with low pad level to get under or drive through hits. \nHis stiff-arm is strong enough and well placed against defensive backs and linebackers to earn extra yardage when he keeps \nhis legs moving.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Egbuka wins direct collisions with cornerbacks, often initiating them.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He’ll drop his pads or forearm into an oncoming cornerback and bounce off a hit to his legs and \nhips. He can also bounce off a hit to his chest and pads from a linebacker and spin away with the help of a stiff-arm. \nBall Security: He carries the ball high to his chest in traffic. He uses the boundary-side arm and takes swats to the ball. \nHe’ll switch the ball as he works away from pursuit to the opposite side of the field.  \n\n \n91 \nBlocking: Egbuka will close the gap with Man Over Me blocks. He punches with straight jabs with his hands. The punch has \npop, but he locks out his arms too often.  \nIn exceptional circumstances when a defender is too close for him to lock out with a jab, he’ll actually perform an uppercut \nor when he’s focused on turning a defender, he’ll begin with an uppercut  and sustain position. Egbuka is prone to dropping \nhis head and getting beaten to the punch.  \nHe will move his feet when he locks onto a defender. \nWith Most Dangerous Man blocks, Egbuka hustles to get the inside shoulder of his off-coverage opponent from the slot to \nseal him to the outside in the run game. He may not commonly punch with a technically-sound method, but his effort and \nintensity are notable when his block is vital to the play’s success.  \nEgbuka is impatient with his attack against force defenders as a lead blocker and he gets too aggressive late in the \napproach and telegraphs his position too early.  \nDurability: Missed one game as a freshman for undisclosed reasons. Missed some practices with undisclosed injuries and \nwas a gametime decision for one week during his career. Otherwise, no significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Egbuka is worth an early third-round pick in this draft before we learn of the NFL’s \nreferendum. It could rise a round with an ideal fit with an offense similar to the Rams’ scheme.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHighlights \n• \nFull 2024 Highlights \n• \n2021-2022 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n92",
        "analysis": "Emeka Egbuka is a talented wide receiver prospect with a high ceiling but also some limitations.  His strengths lie in his speed, after-the-catch ability, and route-running (particularly in open space and on deeper, developing routes across the middle).  He excels at stacking cornerbacks on vertical routes and has good elusiveness and vision after the catch.  His release techniques are also well-developed.  However, he struggles with tight man coverage, contested catches, and precise timing routes, often opting for an underhand catch even when an overhand approach would be better. His route breaks can be rounded, and he needs to improve his boundary awareness.  He also needs refinement in his blocking technique.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Speed and Elusiveness:**  Exceptional speed allows him to win vertically and make big plays after the catch. He displays impressive agility and the ability to weave through defenders.\n* **After-the-Catch Ability:**  A natural runner with good vision and the ability to break tackles.\n* **Route Running (Open Space):** Effective route running, especially on routes that allow him to gain separation using his speed and across the middle of the field.\n* **Release Techniques:**  Displays a diverse arsenal of release techniques to beat press and off-coverage.\n* **High-Pointing the Ball:** Adept at high-pointing the ball and making difficult catches.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Route Precision:** Sharpen his route running, particularly on timing routes and breaks in tight coverage.\n* **Refine Catch Technique:**  Improve his hand usage and consistently use optimal catch technique.\n* **Strengthen Contested Catch Ability:**  Develop the strength and technique to win more contested catches.\n* **Enhance Boundary Awareness:**  Become more consistent in staying in bounds and executing plays near the sideline.\n* **Develop Blocking Skills:**  Become a more consistent and effective blocker.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum ranges widely:\n\n* **Puka Nacua:** The highest comparison, implying a potentially similar level of success, though the report suggests Egbuka isn't quite at Nacua's level of skill versatility.\n* **Jermaine Kearse:**  Suggests a potential role as a reliable, possession receiver, but possibly lacking the elite athleticism.\n* **Quincy Morgan:** A less prominent comparison, likely hinting at a similar size and skill set, but perhaps with less overall impact.\n\nThe overall comparison suggests a player who could be a productive starter in the right system, but not necessarily a star-caliber wide receiver.  His success will heavily depend on scheme fit. He’s more of a \"big-play\" potential than a high-volume receiver at this stage.\n"

If you prefer a conservative approach with these receivers \nin this draft, make sure you read this and the fantasy advice at the end of the report. \n \n\n \n93 \nRoyals an appealing playmaker who can turn an opportunity into game-breaking outcome. Utah State featured Royals on a \nheavy dose of screens, RPOs, and crossing routes – patterns where they could get him big running lanes.  \n \nEven when Royals didn’t receive those ideal lanes to carry the ball, he could create them on his own. He’s an agile runner \nwith excellent stop-start skills and efficient lateral cuts.  \n \nRoyals has the ceiling in his game to become more than a “Mecole Hardman with Hands.” For that to happen, he has work \nahead of him as a route runner.  \n \nThis is where I can see an argument that Royals’ Depth of Talent score should have been 2.5-5 points lower. That difference \ncould have placed Royals at WR27 or even WR39.  \n \nThis is why I hate ranking. The margin between many of these players is small, but the gap between their rankings is \nmassive. While this statement reflects how the differences in details play out, it is not necessary a reflection of value.  \n \nPut Cordarrelle Patterson at running back early in his career and the details of his evaluation shine through. Place demands \non him at wide receiver that aren’t compatible and he has a lot less value.  \n \nMake Robert Woods a slot receiver in a run heavy offense where he’s an outlet option and he’s not nearly as valuable as \nwhat his evaluation states. Allow Woods to become a slot/flanker hybrid in an offense that allows him to use the greatest \nrange of his route tree, and he’s a Pro Bowl producer.  \n \nRoyals is not a strong route runner by conventional standards, but his ability to develop into one is projectable. The \ncomponents are there, but the stitching that binds them together in one coherent process isn’t all there.   \n \nThe stitching isn’t flawed and has to be removed and reworked as much as it’s missing and needs to be added. That’s easier \nin the case of development.  \n \nAs a result, I’ve made the call to score Royals closer to his projection instead of his current reality. There’s always \nprojection with every evaluation, but there’s more to Royals’ report than usual.  \n \nIf you use the Depth of Talent Score for Royals as a guide for where to draft him, I’ve embedded value where you’re \npotentially reaching for him 1-2 rounds earlier than you should. Don’t do that. In this draft, let him fall to you and hope he \ndevelops into the player I’m projecting.  \n \nThe issues with Royals’ game that are a projection are mostly before he catches the ball.  \n \nRoyals has a variety of release maneuvers, but he doesn’t use pacing to execute them and he’s not going to beat as many \nNFL defenders with pure speed when they press him at the line of scrimmage. At the same time, Royals has a variety of \nmoves and he stacks defenders when he earns separation. \n \nAdding the use of pacing shouldn’t be as difficult of a task, considering that Royals already does a good job with pace \nchanges when he’s setting up defenders for breaks during his stems. It will be important that Royals refines his release \nmaneuvers because he has allowed savvier defensive backs to pin him to the boundary and run him out of the play.  \n \nOnce into his routes, Royals attacks leverage effectively and uses pacing to setup breaks. He’s capable of flat breaks. He \nmake them even better if he snap his turns.  \n \nRoyals’s routes against zone have lapses, too. He shows his eyes too early to the quarterback and doesn’t always read the \ntriangle of defenders as a guide for where to settle. This can create communication issues with his quarterback that leads to \nturnovers.  \n \nRoyals’ best chance of getting open in the NFL before he addresses these issues are on manufactured targets like RPOs, \nscreens, crossing routes with heavy misdirection baked into the play, and vertical routes between zone defenders.  \n \nAs a pass-catcher, Royals has lapses with clap-attacks, but also makes a wide variety of plays on targets away from his \nframe in every direction. His positioning to the ball is better with certain targets than others.  \n \nAfter the catch, Royals can be electric.  \n \n\n \n94 \nRoyals is recovering from a foot injury which could limit his production as a rookie. Royals claims he’ll be ready by training \ncamp.  \n \nThe skeptic and cynic in me believes this is something Royals has to say because he’s hoping to lose as little money as \npossible from a potential slide in draft capital. Running back Jonathon Brooks wasn’t remotely ready to play in training \ncamp, but he told the media the same thing.  \n \nWhile Royals’ foot injury and Brooks’ ACL tear are completely different injuries, both require significant rehab. Royals might \nbe ready—hell, he ran the 40-Yard Dash at the NFL Combine. He’ll likely be ready.  \n \nStill, I’m sure there’s a potential dose of gamesmanship here. You can’t blame him.  \n \nAt the same time, if he ran at the NFL Combine and the foot isn’t football-ready, that 4.42-second, 40-Yard Dash might be \non the low side of his explosion.  \n \nI’m enthusiastic about Royals’ ceiling and how a team could use him productively in his current state of evolution. However, \nthere are reasons not to value him as high as his evaluation.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? He plays almost exclusively on the left side of the formation. Some conceptual work may be \nahead for Royals, but nothing insurmountable. \nConceptual: As an option QB he has a believable pump fake to set up a run. You don’t always see that. Just a fun fact. \nReleases: Royals has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side \nof his front leg.  \nRoyals releases with a sink into his stance and comes off the line without wasted motion, rolling off the front foot. His pads \nare over his knees and his head is up. Royals has repeat lapses of rocking off the back foot even when there isn’t reason to \ndo so.  \nRoyals reduces his inside shoulder from an off-coverage defensive back shooting his hands toward the receiver. He has a \nread step with a shed counter. Neither move has any contrast between patience and suddenness. Neither has violence.  \nRoyals has a stick with a wipe counter at the top of his stems against off-coverage. He’ll use a wipe at the top of stems as \nhe breaks inside or outside. He has a read-step and wipe combo off the line. He also has a read-step and swim combo to \nwork inside and on a crosser against tight coverage.  \nRoyals’ double up is sudden but lacks craft. He counters with a shed.  \nRoyals has a two-quick but there’s nothing setting it up that’s compelling. He uses it to steal a release in the run game. He’ll \nalso use a hesitation to steal a release.  \nHe’ll use a swim counter while stealing a release. When running a short out, he’ll deliver a swat counter after the two-quick.  \nRoyals uses a three-quick to work inside on the slant when he has a two-way go.  \nRoyals has a read-step with a lean-in to set up short in-breakers.  \nRoyals will work outside an outside a defender playing close enough to the boundary that Royals will take himself out of \nbounds to work in that direction when the better play would be to attack inside and then work back to the outside.  \nSeparation: He can earn separation in the intermediate range of the field on a vertical stem. He can take an outside \nrelease against a defender despite a wide split and then stack the defender and buy space away from the boundary before \nfading back to it.  \nRoute Stems: Royals will dive inside to attack inside shade coverage or widen to attack outside shade. He attacks stems \nagainst off-coverage at full speed.  \nRoute Setups: Royals sets up fades with a pace change near the top of the stem and gives a shed to counter the \ndefender’s hands. He’ll take the back of a defender.  \n\n \n95 \nHe’ll stair-step a short in-breaking route with a dive inside, straightening out the stem toward the defender and then use a \ntwo-quick to set up his break inside.  \nHe has decent weight drop with a stutter on the hitch-and-go.  \nRoute Breaks: Royals has a quick three-step break within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage. His speed breaks have a flat \ndrive step and a flat line step. There is no snap. The break step lacks great length. He isn’t accelerating into his breaks.  \nRoyals gets his head around and make his frame a friendly target out of his break, but his breaks lack snap. He can snap a \nturn on a shall out against tight coverage, but I saw this on one route in five games.  \nRoyals works to an open spot when his first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nZone Routes: Royals identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When the first \nbreak isn’t targeted, he’ll work to find an open area. He must read the zone triangle better so he can find the open area to \nwork toward.  \nRoyals tempos breaks across zone coverage, but must wait to show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. \nHe shows his eyes too early.  \nRoyals also has shown multiple times in 2024 that he doesn’t know when to settle and when to continue across the field for \nhis quarterback. He’ll have a defender playing tight man, and he settles on a route crossing the field rather than continue \nmoving and the quarterback is expecting Royals to continue.  \nRoute Boundary: Royals is aware of the boundary and gets to the ground inside the sideline when extending for the target \ntoward the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Royals leaves his feet unnecessarily for high targets, but he also has targets where he can extend fully \nover his head on the move and not break stride—no leap at all. He also has the hand-eye coordination to make one-handed \ncatches over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Royals uses tight overhand attack with targets at his facemask. He’ll high-point targets and dig out \nlow throws below his knees.  \nRoyals has been prone to clap-attack with his overhand position, leading to drops. He can reach behind his break path and \ncatch targets wide of his back shoulder with a clap-attack, but the technique isn’t reliable. He also clap-attacks underhand \ntargets with side-by-side attack.  \nPosition: He is late with jump up and through opportunities to earn position and clap-attacks with the high-point – \nsometimes in exaggerated fashion. He must improve how to embrace the fall so he doesn’t land on the football. He’s better \nat embracing the fall when he’s extending for the target on the run.  \nRoyals has an effective jump up and through against trailing coverage. He uses underhand position or overhand position \nbased on the trajectory of the ball. He has a good pull-back and embraces the fall.  \nFocus: Royals can high-point a target and tack contact to his back as well as high-point in stride and take a hard shot to his \nchest.  \nTransitions: Royals uses catch-and-pierce principles as a ball carrier.  \nElusiveness: Royals has quick stop-start movement and can give a leg and take it away against pursuit arriving from over \nthe top. He also steps over low shots. His two-quick footwork freezes pursuit from over the top and helps him clear a \ncrease.  \nRoyals uses a spin so he can access his stiff arm when carrying the ball on the same side as pursuit. He’s sudden in traffic. \nHe can point the toe, open his hips, and split defenders with a lateral cut on the move.  \nVision: Royals can avoid contact in high traffic areas while working downhill. He’s a decisive straight-line runner and does \ncapable work with screens, RPOs, and crossing routes. He can also create in traffic against unblocked defenders and earn \nyardage that forces him to work laterally.  \n\n \n96 \nPower: Royals can run through wraps to his legs. He has good pad level into contact. He has a capable balance-touch after \nworking through a wrap.  \nRoyals uses a stiff arm to ward off contact from defensive backs. He uses it in conjunction with a spin, especially when he’s \ncarrying the ball under his inside arm and pursuit is coming from the inside.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Royals bounces off hits from cornerbacks. \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots from safeties and linebackers.  \nBall Security: Royals tucks the ball high to his chest. He tucks the ball to his right side even though he’s on the left side of \nthe field and the immediate pursuit is toward his right side. His elbow is loose from his frame.  \nHe can use his left arm to carry the ball, but it must become a regular habit.  \nBlocking: As a stalk blocker Royals needs to deliver a punch to sustain contact. He must improve his approach—earn a flat \nlead to cut off his assignment. He can drop his weight into a squat position.  \nRoyals gets his hands tight enough to work into the chest of the opponent. He also moves his feet to drive the defender off \nthe line. He moves his feet well enough to redirect as the defender redirects.  \nDurability: Season-ending foot injury in 2024.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Don’t draft Royals at a spot commensurate with his Depth of Talent score until we see the \nresults of the NFL Draft. I’d let him fall 1-2 rounds lower than the players who have early-round ADPs in my top-10.  \n \nAfter the NFL Draft, I’ll likely have him lower on my Post-Draft board unless the fit and draft capital is excellent. Not \nexcellent by media-hype Mecole Hardman standards, but stricter standards I apply. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMiss Tracking and Clap-attack \n• \nThree-Step Break, Weight Drop, High-Point, Breaks Wrap \n• \nHigh-Point-Hand-Strength-Contact \n• \nWhat Royals Does Well Right Now – Speed/YAC \n• \nNot on the Same Page with QB: Man vs. Zone Breaks \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n97",
        "analysis": "Jalen Royals is a WR prospect ranked WR10, possessing a blend of exciting potential and notable flaws.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **After-the-catch ability:** Royals is exceptionally dynamic after securing the ball, showcasing excellent agility, stop-start quickness, and lateral movement to create yards.  He excels at making defenders miss.\n* **Athleticism:**  His 4.42 40-yard dash time and overall athleticism are undeniable assets. He can create separation with his speed and acceleration, particularly on screens, RPOs, and crossing routes.\n* **High-pointing ability:** Royals demonstrates impressive ability to high-point the ball, securing catches above his frame.  He can extend to make catches in various directions, both in stride and while leaping.\n* **Run-after-catch (YAC):** His exceptional YAC ability significantly boosts his value.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route running:**  This is his biggest weakness. While he possesses a variety of release moves, he lacks consistency and refinement in his route execution. He often shows his eyes too early to the quarterback, struggles with precise breaks, and doesn't always read zone coverages effectively.  This leads to missed opportunities and potential turnovers.\n* **Release technique:** He needs to improve his pacing and use of releases against press coverage. He sometimes allows defenders to disrupt his routes at the line.\n* **Foot injury:** A recent season-ending foot injury raises concerns about his readiness and long-term durability, despite claims of being ready for training camp.\n* **Scheme fit:**  He heavily favored the left side of the formation in college, which may require adjustments at the NFL level.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided is Chris Chambers - x - John Ross/Corey Coleman. This suggests a player who blends Chambers' size and athleticism with the speed of Ross and Coleman, but without their consistency.  The \"x\" indicates a midpoint – he's not quite any of them, but possesses elements of each.  The report implies he has the ceiling to become more than a \"Mecole Hardman with hands,\" indicating Hardman as a lower-bound comparison.  His potential is high, but his inconsistency could limit his production.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nRoyals is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His after-the-catch ability and athleticism are undeniably impressive, but his significant flaws in route running and the uncertainty surrounding his foot injury could lead to a lower-than-expected NFL impact.  He is projected to be a valuable asset *if* he can significantly improve his route running technique.  The scout suggests drafting him lower than his initial ranking suggests, letting him fall in the draft to secure better value.\n"

If not, Williams has the receiving \nskills to become of truer vision of what the Vikings hoped when they drafted Cordarrelle Patterson. \n \nPatterson was an excellent college receiver at Tennessee. Patterson could run routes, make contested plays, and he was a \nterror in the open field.  \n\n \n98 \n \nAccording to my colleague Russ Lande, many scouts ascertained that Patterson had difficulty translating information from \nthe whiteboard to the field. Patterson had difficulty with the conceptual adjustments NFL receivers had to make at the line \nof scrimmage and early post-snap so they’d be on the same page with their quarterback.  \n \nIf Patterson didn’t have this difficulty, he could have become a productive starter in the NFL in addition to a dangerous \nreturn specialist with running back talents. As many repeat RSP subscribers know, Patterson was the best open-field runner \nI have ever seen as an evaluator.  \n \nWilliams has the physical and the technical tools to become a starting NFL receiver. He has learned a variety of maneuvers \nto release from coverage at the line of scrimmage. The next step is to develop better pacing with their execution so he can \nbait cornerbacks. \n \nAlthough Williams lacks a lot of route setups at this point of his career, his willingness to attack leverage at full speed is a \nrefined tactic that few receiver prospects do well at the college level. This makes the setups he uses all the more \nconvincing.  \n \nTwo of types of breaks that Williams runs need cleaning up. He gets hung up with his footwork coming out of one break and \ndoesn’t drop his weight enough with the other.  \n \nThese are correctable issues. As is the case with his setups, Williams delivers his breaks with a detail that many prospects \ndon’t, and that’s snapping the turns with the punch of his sideline arm.  \n \nAs an evaluator, I’d rather see a wide receiver prospect with a few tools in his kit, but delivering refined execution with \nthem in hand. It’s easier to add more tools when the ones the player has have details that create added separation.   \n \nTCU receivers are victims of logo scouting. Fans point to them only getting use on one side of the field. They also point to \nJalen Reagor, Josh Doctson, and Quentin Johnston – early-round receivers whose careers disappointing relative to \nexpectation – and say TCU is a bad college for drafting wide receiver prospects.  \n \nBesides the fact that logo scouting is a bad idea, Williams is a different player than these three. He also played different \nroles at TCU during his career and lined up in different spots.  \n \nIf Williams bears any similarities to one of these players, it’s to Johnston’s good traits. They are promising route runners \nand skilled after the catch.  \n \nWilliams has some catch-point issues, but they are not as problematic as Johnston’s. Williams doesn’t have difficulty \ntracking the football on vertical routes and earning position where he can optimize his opportunity to catch the ball.  \n \nWhen Williams has a lapse with good technique, it’s a focus drop to check coverage, open field, or the boundary. Another \ntype of lapse occurs with targets on his numbers. He attempts to use underhand position rather than overhand position.  \nYou see this a lot in the NFL. He attacks at the earliest point, but the position isn’t ideal.  \nA third lapse is something I see far less of with his game, but it’s clap-attacking targets over his shoulder with underhand \ntechnique while extending his arms for the ball. This is one of Johnston’s issues as well, but it was far more prevalent with \nJohnston’s game in college and as a rookie.  \nWilliams makes difficult-clutch catches and he makes the easy catches. If he remains a receiver in the NFL and he drops the \nball, you’re going to hear arm-chair logo scouting. Just leave the foolishness alone. It’s like trying to argue with a drunk \nflat-earther.  \nAfter the catch is where Williams’ career could go an entirely different direction. He’s one of the two best ball carriers at the \nreceiver position in this class, and what Williams can do with the ball in his hands is unique to any receiver or tight end this \nyear.  \n \nThe 6’4”, 222-pound Williams is a big, swift, agile, and powerful running back. Not “like a running back.” A running back.  \n \nBy the standards the RSP evaluates running backs, Williams has elite power and elite contact balance. He runs through \nreaches, wraps, and hits from all three levels of the defense – often on the same touch.  \n\n \n99 \n \nWilliams has experience working between the tackles because TCU has used him as a perimeter runner and a between-the-\ntackles back. He has learned a lot about how to blend patience and decisiveness based on his keys.  \n \nWilliams has good footwork and hip mobility to set up blocks as well as bait unblocked defenders. I’m also scouting Wiliams \nas a running back. Much of what you’ll read here will be in that chapter, but with the same insights about his potential as a \nreceiver.  \n \nIf Williams can prove that he’s adept at translating the whiteboard to the field as receiver, he could become a valuable \nhybrid option. An offense could easily feature Williams from the backfield as a receiver.  \n \nWilliams’ new team could potentially generate excellent matchups against linebackers and safeties in space. If the defense \nresponds with a smaller defender over Williams to cover from the backfield, the quarterback can audible to a run and \nWilliams will gain the matchup advantage between the tackles.  \n \nAs long as Williams displays the intelligence and character a team seeks from a player with his skills, he should be an easy \nselection and one a team makes with enthusiasm because there are multiple ways Williams can help a team win—receiver, \nrunner, and return specialist. He could excel at one, two, or all three roles.  \n \nPhysical: He routinely runs through reaches and wraps.  \nTechnical: He routinely works back to the quarterback out of breaks.  \nReleases: Williams has a balanced and staggered stance with his hands resting at either knee. When facing zone coverage \nor off-man, Williams sinks into his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion. He could sink a little deeper.  \nHis body lean from his stance is good. He keeps his pads over his knees, drives out of the stance with a sprinter’s gait, and \nhe pumps his arms early. He sustains that arm pump longer against off-man coverage.  \nWilliams uses read steps when he faces tight man coverage. He’ll use read steps or a double up to steal a release. Williams \nwill also combine a read step with a double up to attack tight coverage at the line on a fade. His hard stick is effective at the \ntop of stems on short routes.  \nWilliams also combines a read step with a swat-swim counter. Against off-coverage, Williams uses a stick and counters the \nhands with a shoulder reduction.  \nWilliams has a sudden two-quick release to get inside press. Against press, Williams uses a foot-switch with a wipe counter \nto work inside the defender’s jam. He uses his feet before countering with his hands.  \nWilliams combines a two-quick with a wipe counter to get inside defenders playing him tight at the line. He combines a read \nstep with a two-quick.  \nHe also has a three-quick release where he emphasizes the last step to deliver the stick before breaking inside against tight \ncoverage.  \nHe has a stutter release but like many of his releases, he must cultivate some pace variation to generate a patient but \nsudden quality. His footwork is sudden, but he must develop more patience and pace variation.  \nSeparation: Williams is a good operator in the shallow zones because he’s quick, physical, and has length. This helps him \nseparate from tight quarters and work back to the ball and then turn up-field quickly.  \nWilliams stacks defenders early on intermediate and vertical routes.  \nRoute Stems: Williams stems inside to attack the inside leverage and set up out-breaking routes. He’ll also stem outside to \nattack outside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Williams accelerates into his stair-steps on intermediate and vertical routes to sell the off-coverage into \nturning its hips the wrong way. He’ll punctuate that sale with an inset. \nWilliams will work into the toes of off-coverage playing outside shade to set up breaks to the inside. He’ll also take the back \nof the defender, too.  \n\n \n100 \nRoute Breaks: When running short routes, Williams has a long break step and displays weight drop. I need to see him do \nthis against man-to-man with intermediate timing routes.  \nWilliams executes intermediate curls with good weight drop as part of a three-step break against zone coverage. He also \nworks back to the quarterback and away from the zone defender. When Williams has lapses, he doesn’t extend his break \nstep and drop his weight enough to make the break three steps.  \nWilliams’ drive step and line steps are sharp for flat breaks in fin routes and other short in-breaking speed cuts. He gets his \nhead around quickly—even snapping it around on slants.  \nWilliams snaps his speed breaks on outs against off-coverage. He snaps the curl with a good punch of the sideline arm.  \nSnap-plus-two breaks where he turns his hips inside and runs out the break aren’t smooth and he gets hung up with his \nfootwork.  \nZone Routes: When his quarterback breaks the pocket, Williams works into open space and continues to show his eyes to \nthe passer. He tempos his breaks when working across a zone.  \nWilliams waits to show his eyes to the quarterback on intermediate and vertical zone breaks until he has cleared the buzz or \nrollover defender.  \nWilliams identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open space. Williams also identifies the \ncoverage triangle and settles inside it.  \nRoute Boundary: When attacking outside the numbers and high-pointing within five yards of the boundary, Williams drags \nthe heel as he reaches the ground to ensure he gets in bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Williams leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at helmet or just above helmet level – most often when \nthe route is more than 10 yards past the line of scrimmage. He tracks the ball over his shoulder with full extension and \ntakes contact to his back.  \nWilliams tracks the ball directly over his head and he’s often successful with doing so. There are targets where Williams \nwould be better off turning his head to the opposite shoulder and re-locating the ball instead of continuing to track it directly \nover his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Williams catches the ball with overhand position wide of his frame and above his head without \nleaving his feet with short targets. When working vertical targets where he’s facing the ball, Williams has lapses where he \nleaves his feet for overhand targets at the numbers.   \nWhen Williams is earning targets in shallow zones, he keeps his feet on the ground despite the target forcing him to extend \nover his head for the ball. He also catches the ball at the earliest point of the target.  \nStill, it’s good that Williams uses overhand position with targets at his numbers. He’ll extend underhand for targets at his \nwaist. He makes clutch catches between defenders late in games when down.  \nWilliams makes difficult extensions away from his frame with overhand position for targets. He’ll also reach behind his break \npath and do it with high targets, targets at the numbers, and targets below his knees.  \nWilliams digs out low targets and fully extends his frame to get under the ball with underhand technique.  \nWhen Williams has a lapse with good technique, it’s a focus drop to check coverage, open field, or the boundary. Another \ntype of lapse occurs at the numbers when he attempts to use underhand position rather than overhand position. He attacks \nat the earliest point, but the position isn’t ideal. A third lapse is something I see far less of with his game, but it’s clap-\nattacking targets over his shoulder with underhand technique while extending his arms for the ball.  \nWilliams high-points effectively and can snare the ball with one hand and clap onto it with the other after securing it with \nthe first hand. He has hand strength to resist the prying hands of a defender.  \nPosition: Williams embraces the fall so he doesn’t land on the ball. Williams as an effective pull-back technique to turn \naway from the defender in tight coverage as he makes the catch. Williams can jump up and through to high-point the ball \nbetween defenders and embrace the fall.  \n\n \n101 \nFocus: Williams can take hard contact to his back and shoulders as he secures vertical targets. He also can take hard \ncontact to his chest after extending away from his frame and securing the target on the move. He can work tight spaces \nbetween defenders and take hard shots late in games.  \nWilliams will high-point with a defender tight to his back and still win the ball. He’ll also high-point between defenders and \nwin while hit in the back and the chest.  \nTransitions: Williams uses catch-and-pierce technique to transition downhill. He also obeys the ball.  \nElusiveness: Williams uses sticks and dips to avoid pursuit and he’ll gets his heels up to avoid defenders reaching for his \nfeet a second time as he lifts out of wraps and reaches. He times hurdles well in the open field. He’s also good at timing \nducks under reaches and wraps.  \nWilliams has sharp pressure cuts and short lateral and jump cuts. His curvilinear speed along with his ability to open his \nhips with the point of the toe helps Williams earn the short-side edge and bend around linebackers and defensive backs.  \nWilliams can deliver moves in succession, including dynamic cuts, to make multiple defenders miss in the open field. He \nonly needs 1-2 steps to setup a transition downfield from a perimeter approach.  \nVision: Williams reads his blocks and sets up those blocks with presses. He has good timing with moving away from \nunblocked defenders in tight confines. Williams reads pursuit effectively in the open field and makes efficient dips to find \nopen space.  \nWilliams has strong peripheral vision with pursuit from behind and outside. When used as a runner from the backfield, \nWilliams must read safety leverage better on gap plays where he has an opportunity to cutback inside a defensive back on a \nperimeter run.  \nPower: Williams pulls through reaches to his lower legs from linebackers. He pulls through reaches to his upper body from \ndefensive linemen. He’ll also pull through wraps from linebackers wrapping his upper body. He has an effective stiff-arm to \naid him. He keeps his feet moving through multiple wraps, reaches, and hits, and pushes the pile. \nWhen working the perimeter on a designed play, Williams drops his pads under the wrap attempts of defenders, and this \nhelps him turn the corner and get up the boundary for additional yardage.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Williams bounces off direct shots from safeties and cornerbacks. He has a strong balance touch \nas well.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Williams bounces off the glancing shots of defensive linemen with a runway. He’ll bounce off \nhard shots to his legs from linebackers with a runway. It can be a small runway as a red-zone ball carrier.  \nBall Security: Williams carries the ball high and close to his chest. The elbow is tight to his frame, and he doesn’t swing the \nball in traffic. The ball can get loose from his frame when working in the open field and shedding wraps or making dynamic \nelusive moves.  \nWilliams switches the ball to his boundary-side arm when he gets the first opportunity.  \nBlocking: Williams is a physical blocker. He’ll overextend with his hands, but he squares up the defender with a squat \nposition. When he overextends, his arms can get too straight for him to avoid getting rag-dolled in the NFL against stronger \ndefenders.  \nMore often, Williams closes the gap quick enough for his arms not to get locked out. He also keeps his hands tight enough \nto get into the breastplate of the defender.  \nHe shuffles his feet well to generate lateral movement as a stalk blocker. After delivering a punch and getting his hands into \nthe defender, Williams keeps his feet moving to maintain position against the defender.  \nWilliams also comes off his perimeter assignments, locates the safety and delivers hard shots to the chest with his forearms \n– timing the trajectory of his path to the safety from a good distance. He can handle Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man \nassignments on the same play.  \nDurability: Played only 14 games in freshman and sophomore seasons due to injuries.  \n\n \n102 \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Before the NFL’s referendum on these players, I’m willing to consider Williams in the \nsecond round because, at worst, I expect he can become a starting receiver with an 800-1,100-yard ceiling. At best, he \ncould become a running back with a ceiling of 2,000 yards from scrimmage and double-digit scores.  \n \nIf the NFL team that drafts Williams chooses Williams as a running back, I’ll likely have him as a first-round selection.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStem, stair-step, inset, tracking, vs. contact \n• \nClutch catch between two defenders \n• \nWorks back to the ball and open-field running \n• \nLow and behind with underhand and away from frame \n• \nSharp break vs tight coverage \n• \nPower and Contact Balance \n• \nFull-extension grab \n• \nHigh-points with jump up and through between two tight defender for TD \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n103",
        "analysis": "Savion Williams is a highly-rated (WR11) 6'4\", 222-pound wide receiver prospect from TCU with exceptional versatility and physical tools.  His profile suggests a player on the cusp of being an immediate NFL starter.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Physicality and Power:** Williams possesses the size, speed, agility, and power of a running back, routinely running through tackles and showcasing elite contact balance.  He excels at breaking tackles and pushing the pile, making him a unique dual-threat.\n* **After the Catch:** He's considered one of the two best ball-carriers among receivers in his class, with unique abilities in the open field.  His vision, elusiveness (using sticks, dips, hurdles, and ducks), and power make him a dangerous runner.\n* **Receiving Skills:** While needing refinement, he displays promising route running, especially his ability to attack leverage at full speed and his detailed execution of breaks.  He excels at high-pointing the ball and making difficult catches, even in tight coverage.\n* **Versatility:**  His skills translate seamlessly to multiple positions (receiver, running back, return specialist), offering tremendous positional flexibility for NFL teams.\n* **Release Techniques:** Williams possesses a diverse set of release techniques to beat press coverage, showcasing impressive footwork and hand usage.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  While he has the tools, he needs to improve the consistency and pacing of his route running, particularly in his breaks and setups.  This includes better weight distribution and footwork.\n* **Translating to the Field:**  Like Cordarrelle Patterson, his NFL Player Comparison, Williams needs to consistently translate his knowledge from the playbook to on-field execution.\n* **Catch Point Consistency:** While he makes difficult catches, he has lapses in technique, particularly with targets at his numbers and over his shoulder.  Improving catch technique will be key.\n* **Positional Uncertainty:** While his versatility is a strength, the NFL team will need to determine his optimal position (WR or RB).\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Cordarrelle Patterson:**  The primary comparison, highlighting Williams' potential as a dynamic, multifaceted player with running back-like skills. However, the comparison also points to the need to improve his ability to translate theoretical knowledge to on-field performance.  Patterson's college success wasn't fully translated to consistent NFL production at wide receiver, even though he became a valuable special teams player and running back option.\n* **Quentin Johnston (with caveats):**  Williams shares some similarities with Johnston in route running and after-the-catch ability but is considered to have fewer issues with catch-point technique.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWilliams possesses exceptional athleticism and physical tools.  His success in the NFL hinges on refining his route running, improving catch consistency, and showcasing the ability to execute on the field what he understands conceptually. If he does, he has the potential to be a highly valuable offensive weapon, potentially even a star, playing multiple roles. The evaluation suggests he projects to at least a starting-caliber wide receiver, with a possible higher ceiling as a running back.\n"

Noel might be that option.   \n \nNoel possesses excellent stop-start quickness and re-accelerates well. He applies this athletic skill effectively as a route \nrunner and ball carrier. He’s not as refined as Golden in any area of the game, but his game has few things to clean up—\nmostly opportunities to add.  \n \n\n \n104 \nOne thing that may hold Noel back from starting early is his release work. Noel has a variety of moves, but he’ll need to \nlearn more and incorporate a contrast of patience and suddenness to the footwork with the new maneuvers and the old.  \n \nNoel uses a host of setups at the top of his stems. His breaks are cleaner in some ranges of the field more than others, but \nthere isn’t a significant issue holding Noel back from tightening up the execution where there’s some sloppiness.  \n \nNoel catches the ball with good attack and make plays on targets that arrive with high and low trajectories. He can win \nagainst tight coverage and contact.  \n \nNoel runs to open space and manipulates defenders in the open field. He knows when to get downhill and take what the \ndefense gives him. He follows his blocks.  \nNoel can press a defense work with his blocks for yardage. He has an effective stiff arm to ward off a defender’s reaches in \nthe open field. He gets his pads under hits or drops his pads into contact. He’ll run through cornerbacks with his contact \nbalance.  \nNoel could earn a significant role this year. Eventually, he has the tools to become an every-down starter who can work \ninside and outside.  \n \nTechnical: Noel can throw the ball 45 yards with catchable accuracy on an option pass to his right.  \nReleases: Noel has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang on either side of \nhis front knee, but just in front of the leg. Noel sinks well into his stance before coming off the line with no wasted motion. \nHe rolls off the front foot.  \nNoel has lapses—and frequent enough label a bad habit – of rocking off the back foot before rolling off the front foot.  \nNoel has a sudden read step or stick. He can reduce his shoulder or use a shed against defenders shooting their hands to \nhis inside shoulder. He’ll also counter a defender’s hands off the stick with a swat or a double swat.  \nNoel has a blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed combo – against inside shade leverage.  \nNoel has a wipe counter to a defender shooting his hands at Noel’s outside shoulder.  \nNoel uses a hesitation and two-quick combo with a wipe counter to work outside a defender after attacking the defender’s \ninside leverage. He also uses the two-quick to steal a release in the running game.  \nHe uses a double up with a wipe counter to attack outside leverage at the line.  \nSeparation: Noel has notable stop-start quickness off the line or from a static position. He’ll blow by an out-of-position \nsafety in the middle of the field on the post or deep over and sustain separation from the secondary to flip the field. He can \nbeat corners and safeties one-on-one on a deep post with the help of a double move mid-stem.  \nNoel has elite speed, but I’ve noticed that he earns separation early and his quarterback’s arm doesn’t match Noel’s top \ngear. A lot of routes break across the field so the quarterback can exploit the deep range of the field while mitigating the \ndanger of underthrowing a straight vertical target. There are a lot of rail shots and seam shots where Noel is slowing down \nafter his break because the ball lacks the velocity/distance to match Noel’s speed.  \nI’ve only seen Noel stack a player once in two years’ games. It was on an intermediate route where he delivered an inset \nand he stacked the defender for a brief moment to deliver the inset. I don’t normally project that a player will stack and \ngive him credit for doing so, but Noel is that exception based on what I shared above. \nRoute Stems: Noel will dive his stems against inside shade to set up a wipe to the outside. He’ll take the back of a \ndefender who turns his hips toward the original stem. He’ll also widen a stem late against an off-coverage defender.  \nRoute Setups: Noel uses his eyes, head fakes, and his feet in combination at the top of stems to set up breaks, including \ndouble moves like out-and-ups. Noel uses a stair-step to work the deep over, but he can prolong the vertical sale of the \nsetup.  \nNoel has a capable inset to set up the stutter-and-go that baits the off-coverage defender over the top of him. Noel sells a \nshoulder fake to the outside to serve as a peek at the top of his stem but must sell with the head and eyes.  \n\n \n105 \nNoel also sells the peek better on a deep post.  \nRoute Breaks: Noel has a long break step into a three-step break. When executing hard breaks on intermediate curls, he \ncan drop his weight into the break step. He will work back to the quarterback out of the break.  \nWhen breaking outside, Noel gets his head around early to look for the ball and maintains a friendly position with his frame.  \nOn speed outs, Noel’s drive step isn’t flat enough and he initially drifts with his breaks. He has compensated with flatter line \nsteps. When running shallow speed outs, Noel can deliver a flat drive step and flat line step.  \nNoel has a drop and pop break, but the weight drop can be deeper.  \nZone Routes: Noel works into the open zone on vertical routes after identifying the second-level defender. He tempos his \nbreaks and doesn’t turn his eyes to the quarterback until he has cleared the buzz or rollover defender.  \nWhen working under the zone, he settles into the open area and presents a friendly target. He must deliver his turns with \nsnap.  \nRoute Boundary: Noel is aware of the boundary and toe-taps in stride on out routes.  \nPass Tracking: Noel tracks the ball over his shoulder with his back to the quarterback. He’ll attack at the earliest point with \nsome routes over the shoulder, using overhand position. He displays late hands when working vertical routes with coverage \ntrailing him.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Noel can attack targets at waist level with underhand position away from his frame. When attacking \na target arriving at the numbers, Noel extends his arms with overhand position at the earliest point of arrival.  \nNoel extends well underhand and wide of his frame when the target is below his knees and slides for the catch. He can high-\npoint.  \nPosition: Noel makes sliding dig-outs of low targets and embraces the fall while doing so.  \nFocus: Noel can track the ball over his shoulder on the seam route and take a hit to his chest as he makes the catch. He \ncan take contact to his back while catching the deep post.  \nTransitions: Noel can catch and pierce downhill with his back to the defense.  \nElusiveness: Noel only needs 1-2 quick steps to transition downhill from a sideline-to-sideline path. He plays with pacing \neffectively to set up unblocked defenders. He has sudden footwork and can slide and/or lift his feet away from shots. Noel \ngives a subtle quarter-turn with his back to the flat linebacker coming downhill as he catches a stick route. This freezes the \ndefender to the outside as Noel turns downfield to the inside.   \nVision: Noel runs to open space and manipulates defenders in the open field. He knows when to get downhill and take what \nthe defense gives him. He follows his blocks.  \nBecause of the nature of the offense and routes he runs, there weren’t limited reps to see Noel demonstrate patience and \ngame management as a runner. Noel demonstrated that he could press a defense inside and work outside his blocks for \nyardage. He also showed that he would step out of bounds in two-minute situations to conserve the clock after bleeding the \nplay for the yardage that was available.  \nPower: Noel has an effective stiff arm to ward off defender reaches in the open field. He gets his pads under hits or drops \nhis pads into contact. \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Noel can drop his pads into a cornerback and run through, knocking the opponent on his back.  \nBall Security: Noel tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm. The ball hangs loose from his chest and his side. He can take \ncontact to the ball when he knows it’s coming.  \n\n \n106 \nBlocking: Noel slides inside with good quickness when squaring an off-ball linebacker on Most Dangerous Man assignments. \nHe earns a squat position and moves laterally to maintain it as he closes on the defender, taking the air out of the \ninteraction.  \nNoel’s hands can be tighter but he earns position on the defender with his arms bent at the elbows so he’s not easily rag-\ndolled against a larger defender. He keeps his feet moving and when the defender changes direction without shedding him, \nNoel can drive the defender to the ground because he has maintained position.  \nHe will run off a defender and tilt into him to transition from route runner to blocker.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Noel is a viable second-round pick who might fall to the third round in many rookie drafts. \nDespite a near-starter grade, bet on Noel sitting on the bench as a low-to-mid-level contributor this year.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBlocks LB with Good Position and Placement \n• \nEmbraces the Fall \n• \nStem and Release Work for 75-Yard TD \n• \nPeek, Post, Track, and Catch vs. Contact \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n107",
        "analysis": "Jaylin Noel is a WR prospect ranked WR12 by RSP, possessing a blend of speed, quickness, and route-running ability.  His game is characterized by excellent stop-start acceleration and the ability to re-accelerate effectively after breaks. He's a strong run-after-catch player who can manipulate defenders in the open field and finish runs powerfully. His ability to win against tight coverage and contact is notable.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Speed and Agility:**  Elite stop-start quickness and acceleration.  Excels in creating separation, particularly on deep routes.\n* **Route Running:**  A diverse route tree with capable breaks, although refinement is needed in consistency. Effectively uses setups and sells fakes to beat defenders.\n* **After the Catch:**  Runs to open space, follows blocks effectively, and possesses a strong stiff arm.  Demonstrates good contact balance.\n* **Ball Skills:**  Catches the ball well with strong hands in various positions and trajectories, including against tight coverage.  Good at tracking the ball over his shoulder.\n* **Blocking:**  Shows promise in pass protection, earning good position and demonstrating tenacity.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Consistency:** Needs to refine his route execution, particularly the consistency of his breaks and releases.  Improving his release work, particularly in incorporating patience and suddenness, is key.\n* **Overall Refinement:** While possessing raw talent, he needs further development in all aspects of his game to reach his full potential.\n* **Quarterback Limitations:** His speed sometimes outpaces his quarterback's ability to deliver the ball accurately and with sufficient velocity.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The scouting report compares him to Matthew Golden (high-end potential), John Metchie (refined route runner), and Devin Duvernay (versatile contributor).  This suggests a potential range of outcomes from a high-level starter to a solid rotational player.  His comparison spectrum highlights his potential but also acknowledges the need for refinement.\n\n**Overall:** Noel is a high-upside player with potential to be a rotational starter, even an eventual every-down player,  but he needs to improve consistency and polish his technique to fulfill that promise.  He's a likely mid-round draft pick.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR13 \nJersey No. 2 \nHeight/Weight: 6’4”/202 School: Arkansas / Texas A&M-Commerce  \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Brian Thomas - Hakeem Nicks - Chris Henry/X/Josh Reynolds - - Justin Hunter  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 84.7 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \nArmstrong is on the cusp of the Starter tier: Starting immediately with a large role and learning on the go. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \nOpp \nAub '24 \nTen '24 \nLSU '24 \nTex '24 \nOverall \nRec \n5 \n9 \n7 \n6 \n27 \nYds \n47 \n139 \n94 \n74 \n354 \nTds \n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n1 \nPinpoint (PP) Targets \n3 \n4 \n6 \n2 \n15 \nPinpoint (PP) Caught \n3 \n4 \n6 \n1 \n14 \nPinpoint (PP) Dropped \n  \n  \n  \n1 \n1 \nPinpoint % \n100% \n100% \n100% \n50% \n93% \nGeneral (G) Targets \n1 \n  \n1 \n1 \n3 \nGeneral (G) Caught \n1 \n  \n1 \n1 \n3 \nGeneral (G) Dropped \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nGeneral % \n100% \n#DIV/0! \n100% \n100% \n100% \nPP Targets vs Contact \n2 \n  \n  \n1 \n3 \nPP Caught vs Contact \n1 \n  \n  \n1 \n2 \nPP Dropped vs Contact \n1 \n  \n  \n  \n1 \nPP vs Contact % \n50% \n#DIV/0! \n#DIV/0! \n100% \n67% \nG Targets vs Contact \n1 \n4 \n  \n1 \n6 \nG Caught vs Contact \n  \n4 \n  \n1 \n5 \nG Dropped vs. Contact \n1 \n  \n  \n  \n1 \nG vs. Contact % \n0% \n100% \n#DIV/0! \n100% \n83% \nTight Coverage Targets \n2 \n3 \n  \n2 \n7 \nTight Coverage Caught \n1 \n3 \n  \n2 \n6 \nTight Coverage Dropped \n1 \n  \n  \n  \n1 \nTight Coverage % \n50% \n100% \n#DIV/0! \n100% \n86% \nMiss-Tracked Targets \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nRoute Mixup \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nJuggled \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nDifficult \n  \n1 \n  \n1 \n2 \n \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Armstrong has the length, strength, and skills to become a productive receiver. He’ll thrive over the \nmiddle, after the catch, and isolated at the boundary in the intermediate and vertical passing game.  \n \nArmstrong’s game immediately reminds me of the best we’ve seen in the NFL from Josh Reynolds – dig routes, the red \nzone, and tracking at the boundary. There’s also potential for more.  \n \n\n \n108 \nThink along the lines of a modern-day Hakeem Nicks who matches up one-on-one along the perimeter and has power to win \nafter the catch. Then, mix in a dash of crisp route running and length that Brian Thomas has to offer. \n \nThe 4.51-second, 40-Yard Dash may seem like a gigantic, “yeah, but…” to his evaluation, but that mark is more than good \nenough for a starting possession receiver. According to NFL Network’s, Daniel Jeremiah, the fear was that Armstrong might \nrun in the 4.6-4.65 range.  \n \nThe fact Armstrong ran within a range that’s well within the tier of a player with starter speed in the NFL is good news. If \nhe’s going to maximize his ability to separate against man-to-man, Armstrong must embed more pacing nuance into his \nrelease packages.  \n \nArmstrong has the short-area quickness to earn separation with his footwork and control the route early. He’s successful \nearning separation against college defenders without great release footwork, but that’s about to change.  \n \nHis route setups have promise but they require more emphasis for them to work in the NFL. Armstrong is close to making \nthat happen.  \n \nArmstrong’s breaks are better in some ranges of the field and routes than others. The fact he can execute them well in the \nplaces he does projects well for him improving elsewhere.  \n \nArmstrong’s catch-point skills are the strength of his game. He’s a good tracker, has strong hand-eye coordination, and he \nowns the boundary from the break point to the catch point.  \n \nArmstrong’s positioning between the defender and the ball is sound and he makes a lot of plays against tight coverage and \ncontact. He’s comfortable in these scenarios.  \n \nArmstrong can be sudden or dynamic as a mover, but he rarely combines both qualities into a single move or run. Still, he \ncan get yardage after the catch despite leaving some of it on the field.  \n \nOverall, Armstrong plays like a future contributor with big-play upside who could eventually work his way into a starting \nrole.  \n \nReleases: Armstrong has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front leg. The hands rest at either \nside of the front knee. Armstrong step off his front foot without other wasted motion. His arms move at half the range of \nmotion.   \nArmstrong has a two-quick release to the inside leverage defender to release outside. He’ll use a pair of two quicks to steal \na release or get a release on a slant. He’ll also use a hesitation and a read step or double up to steal a release.  \nArmstrong uses a feet-switch to set up a release inside outside leverage. Armstrong combines a two-quick with a swat, \nwipe, shed, or swim.  \nArmstrong uses a double up to attack the outside leverage defender. He counters it with a wipe. He takes the shoulder away \nfrom reaches from inside leverage at the top of a stem against off-coverage.  \nHe can deliver a stick and counter the defender’s hands with a shoulder reduction at the top of a stem on a crosser.  \nNone of these moves have any contrast of patience and suddenness, but he has the short area quickness to develop \nexcellent maneuvers if he works on executing with artistry.  \nSeparation: Armstrong earns separation on intermediate and vertical routes. His acceleration helps him earn early \nseparation and his long speed is just good enough to maintain it because of his size, length, and positioning.  \nHe can stack early in a vertical route and then buy back the space from the numbers to the boundary on the fade.  \nRoute Stems: Armstrong will dive his stems to attack inside leverage. He’ll also take the back of the defender to set up a \nbreak. He attacks stems at full speed and with his pads low. He’ll also run at the defender.  \nRoute Setups: Armstrong will turn his head inside with a defender trailing and open his chest to the inside for an inset, but \nhe doesn’t hold it as long as he should to bait the defender.  \n\n \n109 \nArmstrong will stair-step a short crosser with a pair of read steps—the first to set up a dive and the second after he \nattacked the vertical part of the stem.  \nArmstrong can give a brief peek at the top of his stem to set up a deep post.  \nRoute Breaks: Armstrong’s speed break has a flat line step, but the drive step has him drifting early in the break. His digs \nhave a flat drive step out of a three-step break and he works back to the ball early.  \nArmstrong has a long break step into a drop and pop, but there’s no weight drop and that limits the deceleration and his \nturn is out of control. This happens with intermediate breaks. When running short routes, he can drop his weight into the \ndrop and pop out of a break step. The short routes improved as the season progressed, which makes sense considering he \nmissed the first two games with a hamstring injury.  \nArmstrong gets good weight drop into three-step breaks on intermediate routes and he can do it with a long break step.  \nZone Routes: Armstrong identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When his \nfirst break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll slide to another spot to help his quarterback. He tempos his breaks across zones to \nmaximize the time he’s open for his quarterback.  \nHe has a good feel for pacing at the top of his stem and early break to work between a tight zone on a route like the dig.  \nRoute Boundary: Armstrong toe-taps the boundary. He can also tap the front foot and drag the back foot while extending \nfor the ball against tight coverage.  \nPass Tracking: Armstrong can attack the ball over his head without leaving his feet unnecessarily. He’ll attack over his \nhead while breaking across the defender while taking contact to his back and even the ball. \nWhen high-pointing, he’s capable of attacking the ball at its earliest point.   \nHe tracks the ball over his shoulder while extending toward the boundary.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Armstrong will high-point or extend for the ball effectively. He can reach behind his break path and \ncatch the ball with a slight clap-attack with overhand position.  \nArmstrong doesn’t work too close to the boundary during his stem, which allows him to buy back space during the break on \na fade.  \nPosition: Armstrong can jump up and through for the ball. He will time his leap to get straight into the air. He can use \noverhand attack to secure the ball. Armstrong embraces the fall after extending for the target.  \nFocus: He can take hits to his back, chest, and the ball and earn the ball. He’ll win against some hard shots to his chest. He \ncan extend for the ball and stay in bounds against tight coverage.  \nHe has a capable pullback on targets with tight coverage to his back.  \nTransitions: Armstrong will catch and pierce downhill. He obeys the ball to dictate transitions.  \nElusiveness: Armstrong spins off hits. He only needs two steps to transition downhill. He’s not a sudden and dynamic \nmover as much as he is a sudden or dynamic mover.  \nVision: Armstrong reads the leverage of defenders on blockers. He’ll press toward the defender and cutback to the \nblocker’s leverage. \nHe often uses efficient moves or dynamic moves in tight space to make the first man miss and then get downhill as quick as \npossible. He’s creative against the first pursuer, but doesn’t string moves together as well afterward. \nHe can adjust to backside pursuit arriving on the periphery of his vision and make multiple cutbacks as he works across and \ndown the field. \nPower: Armstrong uses his stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. When he drops his pads, he can get under hits.  \n\n \n110 \nArmstrong can do more to lower his pads into contact. He will drop his pads, but not enough to get stood up by a defender \nwhose pads are lower. He will push through multiple defenders wrapping him high in the secondary and earn yardage until \nbrought to the ground.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can win glancing shots against safeties who are flat-footed that he meets with downhill \nmomentum.  \nBall Security: Armstrong carries the ball high to his frame and can take contact to the ball and the ball-carrying arm. He \ncan carry the ball low and loose from his frame like a smelly, dirty diaper. Even when he initially tucks the ball to his chest, \nhis movements lead Armstrong to loosen up his security. He will carry the ball away from the nearest pursuit angle.  \nBlocking: Armstrong can earn a squat and square position to close the gap with the defender. Armstrong’s arms are too \nwide and he’s more of a hugger than a striker when this happens. When he gets his hands tight, he can strike the chest and \nknock a cornerback off-balance.  \nArmstrong will work inside to the linebacker and attack the inside shoulder to fan the defender outside, but he must close \nthe gap so he can truly drive the defender to the boundary. When he shuffles his feet with a wide base, he can handle \nlinebackers in the flat to seal them to one side of the field.  \nDurability: Missed first two games with a hamstring injury in 2024.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Armstrong will likely get drafted late on Day Three. In rookie drafts before the NFL Draft, \nArmstrong might not get drafted in a lot of leagues with formats of 4-5 rounds.  \n \nIn these scenarios, Armstrong will be a reasonable investment beginning at the tail-end of the fourth round. After the NFL \nDraft, Armstrong could see his draft capital rise to early Day Three and that could increase his fantasy value by a round.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nBoundary work, tracking, extension, embraces the fall \n• \nAccelerates into the top of his stem and hard break with weight drop \n• \nEarly Attack \n• \nAttack, tracking, and pullback \n• \nMaintains line, frames separation, one-handed grab, boundary work \n• \nTwo-quicks, slant, catch vs contact  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n111",
        "analysis": "Andrew Armstrong is a WR prospect with intriguing size (6'4\", 202 lbs) and strong hands, projecting as a rotational starter with potential to become a full-time starter.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Catch Point Dominance:**  Armstrong excels at high-pointing the ball, showcasing excellent tracking skills, hand-eye coordination, and the ability to win contested catches, even against tight coverage and contact.  He's comfortable working the boundary.\n* **Size and Strength:** His physical attributes allow him to win jump balls and create yards after the catch (YAC). He uses his frame effectively to shield defenders.\n* **Intermediate and Deep Routes:** He shows proficiency on intermediate and vertical routes, using his acceleration and length to create separation.  His dig routes are a particular strength.\n* **YAC Ability:** While not exceptionally elusive, he can power through tackles and generate consistent YAC.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** While showing promise, Armstrong needs to improve his route running consistency, particularly incorporating more nuance and pacing into his releases to create better separation against NFL-level defenders.  His breaks are inconsistent across different route types and field positions.\n* **Speed:** While his 4.51 40-yard dash is adequate for a possession receiver, enhancing his quickness and agility could unlock more potential for separation.\n* **Ball Security:**  He needs to improve his ball security, as he sometimes carries the ball loosely.\n* **Blocking:** His blocking technique needs refinement; he's more of a \"hugger\" than a powerful striker.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report draws comparisons to several players, highlighting different aspects of his game:\n\n* **Josh Reynolds:**  Armstrong's dig routes, red-zone prowess, and boundary work are reminiscent of Reynolds' game.\n* **Hakeem Nicks:**  This comparison emphasizes Armstrong's size, strength, and ability to win one-on-one matchups along the perimeter.\n* **Brian Thomas:** This comparison points to Armstrong's potential for crisp route running and length.\n* **Chris Henry:** This comparison likely highlights his physicality and ability to win contested catches.\n* **Justin Hunter:** This comparison might refer to his size and deep-threat potential (although less explicitly stated).\n\n\n**Overall:**  Armstrong possesses a compelling blend of size, catching ability, and YAC potential.  Addressing his route-running and ball security concerns will be key to maximizing his NFL potential and achieving his full starting potential.  He's a Day 3 draft prospect with upside.\n"

He makes exciting plays with the ball in the air and runs well after the \ncatch—displaying agility and power.  \n \nI remember my first time seeing Terrell Owens on television. These were qualities that caught my eye. They are qualities \nthat people associate with stars in the making.  \n \n\n \n112 \nPerhaps Harris becomes that next star who everyone could see coming early on for the same reasons. What I can tell you is \nthat there was a lot more that Owens learned to do in San Francisco that made him a star. Without those skills, Owens \nwould have been a preseason star who delivered little more than highlight reel eye candy in August.   \n \nHarris is on the right track. He demonstrated knowledge of a lot of techniques and concepts, but his execution of these skills \nat this point is a continuously improving work in progress.  \n \nHarris uses a lot of different release combinations against coverage. Some have artistry, but just as many aren’t as refined.  \n \nHarris has a variety of route setups, but doesn’t apply them with the expertise that will be as convincing to NFL defenders. \nThey’re often not so convincing to college defenders.  \n \nOne thing that will help is if Harris attacks his stems with greater ferocity and executes with precision and snap that’s often \nmissing. This is one the biggest differences between Harris being a contested-catch and zone option and becoming a strong \nman-to-man route runner.  \n \nRight now, Harris is best-known for his contested-catch and zone work. Although he’s known for his flashy receptions, there \nare a variety of technique lapses with his hands.  \n \nHarris clap-attacks high-point opportunities too often. He also uses underhand attack in situations where it’s not optimal \nand hurts his chances to earn the ball.  \n \nDespite these occasional gaffes, Harris adjusts well to the football and positions himself effectively to win contested plays. \nHe’s a good tracker of the ball.  \n \nAfter the catch, Harris shines. He has a good feel for working to open space in the secondary and can find secondary lanes \nagainst 2-3 defenders in pursuit to break big plays.  \nHarris is patient with setting up defenders pursuing from over the top. He manages his decision-making based on game \nscript. He can create lanes by press blocks and handle unanticipated obstacles.  \nHarris is a strong runner who can pull through wraps and work past multiple points of contact.  \n \nHe’ll begin his career with situational usage that generates big enough plays to get fans and teammates excited. If he can \nrefine the routes, he’ll become one of the top-two producers in a team’s passing game.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? The patience-and-suddenness of his double-up was more artful as the 2023 season \nprogressed.  \nTechnical: He has the arm to throw the ball 50 yards but must display much greater accuracy and/or judgment with the \nreceiver’s route.  \nReleases: Harris has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee. He can generate a deeper sink into his stance, but he doesn’t waste  movement and rolls off his front foot. \nHe gets his pads over his knees  \nHarris has instances of rocking off his backfoot before rolling off his front foot into the release.  \nAgainst tight press-man coverage, Harris has a quick double-up and shed counter to attack inside shade leverage with his \nfeet and then release outside. He also combines a foot-switch with a wipe against tight coverage with outside shade and \nhe’s ultimately releasing to the inside.  \nHarris has a two-quick release to attack inside shade and work outside. Harris will counter the two-quick with a wipe. His \ntwo-quick has a patient-but-sudden quality. So does his two-quick and shed.  \nHe’ll combine a two-quick and stick. He has a hesitation move but could take an extra step to really sell it.  \nHe’s developing a competent read-step/shoulder reduction combo to earn outside position.  \nHarris can counter a defender’s hands with a double swat or with a blade release where he reduces the shoulder and sheds \nthrough it.  \n\n \n113 \nOne of his best moves is a read step to attack the outside leverage and a violent wipe to work back to the inside.  \nHe has a nice hesitation to set up his stick or read step against outside shade defenders.  \nHarris will use a stick at the top of his stem against off-coverage 2-3 yards off him. \nHe’ll steal a release when not the intended target.  \nSeparation: He can stack a defender on an intermediate stem but he is not a true speed receiver. He can flip the field with \nhis speed, but a high safety at the opposite hash can run him down if there’s more than 40 yards of field to cover.  \nHarris has enough acceleration and speed to earn 1-3 steps on some SEC cornerbacks on go and fade routes that cover 28-\n42 yards –- the RSP’s designated vertical range for a pass. The deepest range is 43-plus, the deep range.  \nRoute Stems: He’ll dive inside with stems or at the top of his stem run at the defender to get the off-coverage defender on \nhis heels late.  \nRoute Setups: Harris will attack the back of a defender when it’s given to him. He has some vertical routes where he will \nstick into the back of the defender, but he’s have more success with taking multiple steps into the back of the opponent.  \nHarris will deliver an inset at the top of stems on intermediate routes against a defender trailing him on the inside.  \nHis favorite vertical route is the stutter-and-go, but the weight drop isn’t convincing enough. He bends his back to crouch \ninto the weight drop but he decelerates into the movement rather than accelerating into it.  \nHarris likes to use his eyes to sell defenders in a direction near the top of stems.  \nRoute Breaks: He drifts out of speed breaks on short outs, but his line step is flat enough to eventually flatten the line of \nthe break. He must develop sharper break steps and drive steps. He drive step is flat enough when facing off coverage but \nnot flat when facing tight man-to-man.  \nHarris can be prone to falling during hard breaks because he leads too far backward when dropping his weight. When he \ndoesn’t fall, he’s gearing down into the weight drop too soon and it slows the break. Harris is not accelerating into the top of \nhis stem. He can slip out of spot routes coming out of a hard break because his feet aren’t in a good spot to square at the \nturn. It forces a last-second adjustment with his feet that can take him off balance.  \nHarris has improved some of his hard breaks. He can run a curl with a hard break to the inside combined with a speed turn \nand flat drive and line steps to the outside. The hard break serves as an inset.  \nHe gets his head around quickly and there’s some snap to this turn with a punch of his boundary arm, but not with enough \nroutes. His drop and pop break lacks it. It also lacks weight drop.  \nWith shallow stop routes, Harris has a long break step and a three-step break overall but it needs more snap.  \nAgainst tight coverage on routes breaking outside or inside, Harris must break back to the ball to generate more separation \nto attack the ball without a defender having position to knock the ball away. He must also improve his work when his first \nbreak is covered and he has to work open for his quarterback. He’s slow to react and doesn’t seem confident about where \nhe should be moving next.  \nWhen running the slant, Harris does a good job getting a flat break that prevents the DB from undercutting the route from \ntrail position and if the quarterback leads Harris further downfield, he can then adjust the break path.  \nZone Routes: Harris will identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and settle into the open area. He must display \nbetter awareness of the coverage triangle so he knows when to settle into an open area or continue across the zones. He’s \nhad mix-ups with his quarterback at Louisiana Tech.  \nAt Ole Miss, Harris showed he could tempo his breaks on vertical breaks between the LB and S. He would wait to show his \neyes until he cleared the buzz defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Harris can toe-tap both feet inbounds on short out routes. He can also plant and drag either falling \ntoward the boundary or facing away from the boundary and falling backward. Harris also displays some understanding for \nwhen to fade late to the boundary so he owns more of that horizontal space with the route.   \n\n \n114 \nPass Tracking: Harris has late hands, snapping his arms to the ball as it arrives without tipping off his intentions to the \ndefender. He can win back-shoulder targets over his head with one hand tight to the boundary. He tracks the ball well, only \nleaving his feet when necessary.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Harris catches the ball with good overhand attack with targets at the numbers or shoulder pads. He \ncan attack jump throughs with overhand position over the chest of the trailing defender and gets both hands on the ball at \nleast before the defender can knock the ball or Harris’ arms from the grasp of the ball.  \nAs his career has progressed, he attacks the ball with underhand position more often and loses more often in contested \nsituations as a result. For a phase of his career, it was almost the exclusive method of attack. It worked for him, but it led \nto more drops when the defender could use their hands to pull at his arms or the ball.  \nHarris can high-point a short stop-route with one hand while wrapped from behind. He has the skill to retract the ball as \nwell.  \nHe can dig out low throws when he’s breaking back to the ball or to the outside with underhand position.  \nWhen Harris has lapses with high-point targets, he clap-attacks which leads to him fighting the ball. When he has lapses \nwith targets away from his frame, he’s trying to transition before securing the ball.  \nPosition: Harris has an effective jump through in terms of position and timing as long as the ball isn’t too underthrown. He \ncan attack targets with overhand position but defaults more often to underhand position, trapping the ball. He’ll pull his \nupper body away from defenders once he makes the catch.  \nHarris will embrace the fall to avoid landing on the ball when extending away from his frame for a target that will take him \nto the ground.  \nFocus: Harris can make a back-shoulder catch and take contact to his chest and the ball as he secures the ball. He can take \ncontact to his back as a pass catcher, but also has lapses with clap-attacks that lead to drops.  \nTransitions: Harris will catch and pierce.  \nElusiveness: Harris has a quick first-step and can make the first defender miss with one move before he accelerates \ndownfield. Harris uses sticks, stutters, lateral cuts, and hesitations with pacing to set up defenders in pursuit and make \nthem miss. He can layer moves to do so.  \nAs a runner, Harris is effective at dropping his weight and juking unblocked defenders in space. He has an effective spin and \nalso ducks away from contact.  \nVision: Harris has a good feel for working to open space in the secondary and can find secondary lanes against 2-3 \ndefenders in pursuit to stretch runs another 20-40 yards. He’s patient with setting up defenders pursuing from over the top.  \nHe manages his decision-making based on game script. He can create lanes by press blocks and handle unanticipated \nobstacles.  \nPower: Harris can run through reaches and wraps to his waist and upper legs. He has improved his pad level in 2024. \nWhen he moves his feet, he can pull forward through wraps and hits. When he doesn’t, he’s stuck where he’s contacted.  \nWhen he drops his pads, he can use a stiff-arm to shed defensive backs wrapping him. He pulls through multiple reaches.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a cornerback hitting him high with a glancing shot. He has an effective \nbalance-touch. \nBall Security: He’ll tuck the ball high to his frame and use the boundary-side arm to carry the ball. He can take contact to \nthe ball and maintain possession.  \nBlocking: Harris will transition from route runner to blocker, attacking with his elbows bent and aiming for the defender’s \nchest. He’ll move his feet effectively so he’s not overextending. He uses a wide stance with a squat attack he cultivates \nwithin two yards of the opponent. When he keeps his feet moving after earning position and engaging, he can sustain his \nefforts against defensive backs.  \n\n \n115 \nHarris executes Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man Assignments. He doesn’t back down from combative defenders in \nthe run game.  \nHarris will get a flat lead to seal edge containment in the run game. He shields opponents and doesn’t punch with the \nauthority that could make a difference for his run-game work.  \nHe’ll peel off one blocker and work to the next one that’s deeper. Harris has upside as a blocker if he can deliver a punch \nand establish control early with it.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Harris has the eventual ceiling of peak seasons where the range of production will be 80-\n100 catches, 1300-1500 yards, and 10-15 scores. A more realistic baseline of production will be 60-80 catches, 900-1100 \nyards and 7-9 scores.  \n \nHarris would be a bargain in the early third round of rookie drafts. There are good odds that he won’t fall beyond the second \nhalf of the second round unless the league awards 1.5 PPR points to tight ends.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nIDing and processing the zone triangle \n• \nOne-handed highpoint  \n• \nOne-handed back-shoulder boundary  \n• \nTracking \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n116",
        "analysis": "Tre Harris is a WR prospect with high potential but needs refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Contested Catch Ability:** Excellent at high-pointing the ball and winning jump balls, showcasing good ball tracking and body positioning.  He's effective at adjusting to poorly thrown passes.\n* **After the Catch:**  Excels at making defenders miss and creating yards after the reception, displaying agility, power, and vision. He's patient in setting up blocks and navigating traffic.\n* **Physicality:** Strong runner who can break tackles and power through contact.  He shows a willingness to block and engage defenders.\n* **Route Running (Potential):** Demonstrates knowledge of various route concepts and release techniques, but consistency and execution need improvement.  He has shown flashes of artistry.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  Needs to improve his precision and snap in route execution, especially against man coverage. His stems, breaks, and weight distribution often lack the necessary ferocity and consistency to consistently create separation.\n* **Hand Technique:**  While good at high-pointing, he inconsistently uses optimal hand placement, leading to drops.  Over-reliance on underhand attacks hurts his consistency.\n* **Deep Route Speed:** While possessing adequate acceleration, he's not a true burner and struggles against deep safeties.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Alshon Jeffery:**  Shares Jeffery's size, contested-catch ability, and physicality.  However, Jeffery's route running was more polished early in his career.\n* **Quentin Johnston:** Similar size and after-the-catch ability. Johnston also had questions about his route running coming out of college.\n* **Bryan Edwards:**  Similar physical traits, but Edwards' NFL career hasn't lived up to expectations, potentially highlighting the importance of Harris refining his route running.\n\n**Overall:** Harris possesses the physical tools and after-the-catch skills to be a productive NFL receiver. His ceiling is high, potentially reaching WR1 status if he addresses his route-running consistency and hand technique. However,  he could also land in a rotational role if his development stalls.  His draft stock hinges on how much he improves these technical aspects before entering the league.\n"

He’s a skilled route runner with good hands who has the game to develop into a pro’s pro.  \n \nA five-star prospect considered the No. 2 overall player in the 2019 class in California, McCoy signed with USC in December \n2018. He enrolled there in the spring semester of 2019, and transferred weeks later to Texas.  \n \n\n \n117 \nHe participated in spring practice with the Longhorns and then transferred back to USC in the summer. He left in 2021 and \ntransferred to Tennessee where he played all 12 games for the Volunteers and was second on the team in receiving. He \nremained in Tennessee until he finished his college eligibility.  \n \nMcCoy can win timing routes against man-to-man coverage, and he has enough speed to stretch zone defenses and win \nthat way in the vertical game. In other words McCoy is quicker than fast and savvy with footwork.  \n \nMcCoy has a strong array of releases and executes them with a blend of patience and suddenness. Once into his routes, \nMcCoy has developed effective setups and route breaks as his career progressed. By 2024, McCoy cleaned up the sloppiest \nparts of his route game. The key phases of McCoy’s routes have precision and snap.  \n \nMcCoy has good hands and he makes the plays expected of him and adjusts to targets away from his frame. His tracking \nhas occasional irregularities when the ball arrives above his head, but it rarely leads to dropped passes as much as McCoy \nleaving his feet unnecessarily.  \n \nMcCoy has a good blend of power, contact balance, and agility. He’ll get yards after the catch, and if opponents are sloppy \nwith pursuit angles and tackling, McCoy will make them pay.  \n \nMcCoy reminds me of a blend of Hakeem Nicks and JuJu Smith-Schuster when both were young players and still had \nenough long speed to win against cornerbacks when isolated one-on-one on the backside of a formation.  \n \nWith good health in his future, McCoy could become the 2-3 most productive option for his team’s passing game.  \n  \nPhysical: McCoy’s short-area quickness/change of direction is better than his acceleration and long speed.  \nTechnical: McCoy has a variety of release maneuvers and his hands and feet are sudden and violent in execution. If he had \ngreater acceleration and speed, he’d have upside as a primary receiver in the NFL.  \nMcCoy would benefit from attacking the ball at the earliest point when covered tight on in-breaking routes. This could \nprevent the defender from getting hands on the ball.  \nReleases: McCoy has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands rest at either side \nof his front knee. He sinks lower into his stance to begin his release and doesn’t waste any motion as he rolls off the front \nfoot. His pads lean over his knees and his head is up and looking downfield.  \nMcCoy has a patient, but sudden read step. He’ll also set it up with a hesitation. He’ll attack the leverage of a defender and \ncounter the defender’s hands with a wipe that has power in his hands.  \nMcCoy can get outside a press defender with a two-quick and wipe. He can use a two-quick and a swat-swim combo \neffectively as well as a two-quick and a shed counter. He also uses a foot switch to attack the defender’s leverage. McCoy \nuses the three-quick to get inside on RPOs/screens.  \nMcCoy has an effective hesitation and a wipe counter.  \nMcCoy will use a shed against an inside shade defender reaching for him.  \nHe’ll steal a release with a read step. He’ll also use a hard stick to set up a quick break off the line. He combines a double \nup to the outside with a read step to the inside to get outside a defender playing outside shade. He’ll counter the defender’s \nhands with a swat-swim.  \nMcCoy will use a stutter to set up a break on a screen, RPO, or to steal a release.  \nSeparation: McCoy is a possession-plus receiver for the NFL. He lacks top acceleration off the line and his top gear isn’t \ngoing to get him past top cornerbacks playing him tight. When in the open field, he can hold off a safety pursuing from the \nopposite side of the field for 40 yards.  \nRoute Stems: McCoy will dive inside the leverage of a defender off the line. He’ll also run at the defender. He attacks the \nleverage of off-coverage at full speed.  \nRoute Setups: McCoy has a lean-in to set up breaks inside, but he has to sell it with greater intensity with the stem and \nthe turn back inside. He’ll work into the feet and back hip of a defender to set up a break back to the quarterback.  \n\n \n118 \nMcCoy will use a hip shift to set up off-coverage defenders at the top of his stem. \nIn two games from 2022, McCoy displayed the potential to deliver an inset or peek that could set up his break, but he \ndoesn’t turn his head nearly enough to make the move believable. This is absent on his corner routes.  \nIn 2024, McCoy delivered insets as part of a double move. He begins with a long break step into a three-step break with an \neffective weight drop as he turns his head and inside hip to the inside.   \nRoute Breaks: McCoy turns his head to look for the ball early in his break. With breaks back to the quarterback, McCoy \nworks back to the ball.  \nHe has a three-step break with weight drop after an elongated break step that isn’t long enough to promote as sudden of a \nstop as he’ll need if he’s to defeat tight man-to-man coverage in the NFL. In 2022 and 2023, his weight drop into the break, \ncame during the final two steps rather part of the elongated break step. This limits how sharp and fast his breaks can be. \nMcCoy addressed this in 2024 and dropped his weight immediately after the long break step. \nMcCoy has an excellent pop-and-drop break that generates 2-3 yards of separation against defenders tight and remaining \neven with him during the stem. He also breaks well back to the ball.  \nHe can run a flat break with in-cuts, using a long break step and sharp drive and line steps. He can earn snap with this \nbreak, punching his boundary-side arm to generate the quick turn.  \nA lot of his movements at key parts of routes have snap.  \nZone Routes: McCoy knows how to tempo his breaks on vertical-breaking routes and wait until he has cleared the buzz \ndefender before turning his eyes to the quarterback.  \nWhen horizontal-breaking zone routes, McCoy can identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and settle into the \nopen space with a friendly position to the quarterback.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work back to the quarterback against man or zone coverage.  \nRoute Boundary: When near the boundary or end line, McCoy will slide so he can get a knee inbounds if not both feet. \nHe’ll slide on the side away from the boundary to ensure he stays in bounds. He also toe-taps both feet effectively.  \nPass Tracking: McCoy tracks the ball over his shoulder and can extend his arms to the ball without leaving his feet, but \nhas enough lapses with targets at his helmet height or higher that his tracking can have suspect moments.  \nHowever, this has either improved or McCoy also has moments of tracking excellence within his range of outcomes. He can \nhigh-point with only a small leap if even necessary on routes breaking back to the quarterback as well as targets over his \nshoulder on deep spots while working at full speed.  \nHands/Catch Radius: McCoy can extend his arms and/or turn his frame back to the ball and catch the target with \noverhand position. He can also catch the ball with underhand position at the numbers of his jersey.  \nMcCoy can win targets below his knees and dig out the ball while embracing the fall and taking contact to his back.  \nPosition: McCoy will embrace the fall, turning his frame so he doesn’t land on the ball.  \nFocus: He can catch the ball against tight coverage at his back hip. He can also take contact to his back as he catches a \ntarget above his shoulders and behind his break path.  \nTransitions: McCoy catches and pierces well in tight coverage on routes breaking back to the quarterback, and he can \nbreak tackles and earn yardage because of it. He obeys the ball effectively to determine the direction he turns.  \nElusiveness: McCoy only needs two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach as a runner. He can drop \nhis weight at full speed and bend his way around inside or outside pursuit in tight quarters. He can do the same thing with \nweight drop and opening his hips to flip them 90 degrees within just the point of the toe. He also has an effective jump cut \nimmediately after transitioning on a curl or stop route to avoid a pursuit over the top. \nMcCoy can layer moves together in a short area and avoid a defender. He has an efficient spin. His stop-start movement is \nwell-timed.  \n\n \n119 \nVision: McCoy has a good feel for open space in traffic and can weave around blocks.  \nPower: McCoy uses a stiff-arm to ward off the reach of a defender in the open field. He’ll keep his feet moving through \nwraps to his frame. He pulls through wraps to his waist from cornerbacks. When in traffic, he knows when to drop his pads \nand split defenders.  \nMcCoy can pull through multiple reaches from defensive backs in the open field. He can finish plays with a forearm shiver. \nDirect Contact Balance: McCoy can drop the pads into the oncoming safety and knock the defender down with his pads or \nwith a forearm shiver.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: McCoy can bounce off indirect contact from a defensive back. He has a capable balance touch. \nBall Security: McCoy carries the ball under his boundary-side arm. He’ll switch the ball in the open field. He swings the ball \nas he runs and the elbow is loose from his side.  \nBlocking: When McCoy handles Man over Me Assignments, he keeps his legs moving after contact. He extends his hands to \nthe chest of the defender but overextends his frame. McCoy will transition from receiver to downfield blocker with the tilt of \nhis hips, extending his arms into the defender, and moving his feet to drive the opponent backward.  \nMcCoy has the Tilt Technique to run off a defender, turn into the man and guide the opponent away from the ball carrier. \nHe’ll push on half the man if the defender turns his frame.  \nHe can be guilty of overextending and not getting his feet and hips square, which can lead to McCoy overrunning the \ndefender’s redirects. He’ll also overextend when he’s attempting to throw his hands with power. When McCoy learns how to \npunch he’ll be less likely to overcompensate with extending his upper body over his hips.  \nDurability: McCoy has a fracture-dislocation of his right ankle against South Carolina in late September of 2023. He \nrequired surgery.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: McCoy is a safe pick who will likely be available in the third round of fantasy drafts. He \nshould develop into a plug-and-play starter who spends a fair amount of time on your bench, but can give you big weeks \nthat are predictable based on matchups.  \n \nMcCoy may never become a perennial 1,300-yard receiver, but 900-1,100 yards during his peak years is a possibility if the \noffense has a prolific quarterback.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2022 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n120",
        "analysis": "Horace Bru McCoy III is a WR prospect projected as a rotational starter with a high floor but limited ceiling.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Excellent route technician with a diverse release package, precise route breaks, and strong understanding of route concepts. Shows patience and suddenness in his releases and setups, consistently creating separation against man coverage. Improved significantly in route running precision from 2022-2024.\n* **Hands:** Reliable hands, rarely drops passes, and adjusts well to catch targets away from his frame.  Shows ability to high-point the ball effectively.\n* **After the Catch:** Good blend of power, contact balance, and agility, allowing him to gain yards after the catch and make defenders miss.  Effective stiff arm and ability to pull through tackles.\n* **Consistency:**  His performance shows a high level of consistency, both in catching the ball and executing his routes.  High pinpoint catch percentage.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Increase Top Speed:** While possessing good short-area quickness, his top-end speed limits his ability to consistently beat elite cornerbacks deep.  Improving his acceleration would significantly raise his ceiling.\n* **Ball Tracking:**  While generally good, his tracking at helmet height or above could be more consistent.  Addressing this would minimize occasional missed opportunities.\n* **Release vs. Press:** While adept at releases, focusing on attacking the ball earlier when covered tightly on in-breaking routes could prevent defenders from disrupting his catches.\n* **Injury History:**  A fractured-dislocated ankle in 2023 raises concerns about long-term durability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison to Hakeem Nicks and JuJu Smith-Schuster (in their younger years) highlights McCoy's blend of route-running skill and ability to make plays after the catch.  The Jordan Payton comparison suggests a more limited upside player who is a reliable possession receiver.  McCoy’s game lacks the elite speed of Nicks in his prime but possesses the reliable hands and route-running ability of a player like Smith-Schuster.  He likely projects as a solid contributor but not a top-tier WR1.\n"

Although Prather is a different style of player, his potential career \ntrajectory reminds me some of Josh Palmer – a player who earns early playing time with potential for a bigger role during \nhis second contract.  \n \n\n \n121 \nPrather is a lighter and faster receiver with good routes. He has a nice range of release maneuvers, and he executes many \nof them with refined skill.  \n \nPrather’s route setups have promise, but they need more detail to bait NFL corners and safeties. Prather’s breaks are better \nat some depths and route types more than others.  \n \nPrather is a surehanded receiver who attacks the ball at the earliest point of arrival, uses the optimal attack, and wins \nagainst contact. While Prather tracks the ball well, his positioning needs work. This includes the shoulder or position of his \nframe while tracking a target downfield.  \n \nAfter the catch, Prather will move the chains, but he’s not a dynamic runner. He can work through contact just enough to \nbreak a tackle or pull a defender downhill.  \n \nPrather will likely begin his career as a fourth receiver in a rotation and earn targets in open zones. If he works his way into \na starting role, project him as a possession-plus receiver who can serve as a second or third option in an NFL passing game.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? Prather’s release had less wasted movement as the 2024 season progressed than what \nhe showed to begin the year. There is still a slight rock off the back foot, but it’s much better than it was.  \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Prather will show his eyes inside as he dives inside the stem against off-coverage in \nan attempt to set up the fade. However, this isn’t consistent enough and the lack of detail without the sale of the eyes and \nhead tips off savvy defensive backs playing off-coverage and they won’t bite on the fake. This gives them position to win \nthe ball on vertical routes.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Split end or slot-flanker. \nReleases: Prather begins with a staggered stance, but it does not appear balanced with 80/20 weight distribution favoring \nthe front foot. There’s more weight on the back foot. As a result, he has to bring the back foot up a step before he begins \nhis release forward and that is wasted movement and wasted time.  \nWhen Prather isn’t taking that extra step forward, he’s bouncing off the back foot before coming forward. It appears he’s \ntrying to fix this and from the Michigan State game to the Virginia game, Prather isn’t rocking as much off the back foot. It’s \nonly a slight bounce.  \nPrather’s arms rest at either side of his front knee.  \nPather has a two-quick release to the inside to attack inside leverage and work outside. He uses a wipe or shed to counter \nthe hands of a defender. He’ll steal a release with a two-quick.  \nPrather uses a read step with a double-up as a combination to work inside-out of a defender playing inside shade. When \nusing the read step as his only release, Prather accelerates well out of the stem and earns early separation against man \ncoverage. The same is true when Prather begins with a hesitation.  \nWhen Prather sets up wipe with a hesitation, the movement has a good combination of patience and suddenness. He \ncombines the hesitation and double up with good patience and suddenness. His read step is also patient but sudden against \nman coverage when attacking inside to get outside.  \nPrather uses a wipe with a shove as a combo. He has a swat-swim combo at the top of breaks on hitches against tight \ncoverage. He also reduces the shoulder to counter the hands of an off-coverage defender.  \nPrather comes out of his stance with his pads over his knees and his arms pumping with his head up. Against off-coverage, \nPrather has a capable hip shift but could use more patience and suddenness embedded with his craft.  \nHis foot-switch is an effective method for him to earn separation early against man coverage, accelerating outside the \ndefender. He counters the defender’s hands with a violent shed. Prather also has an effective wipe-shed combo with the \nsame hand.  \nOn shallow crosses, Prather has an effective lean-in following up a two-quick off the line.  \n\n \n122 \nSeparation: Prather has the speed to earn separation within the first 8-10 yards of his release and maintain that \nseparation on vertical and deep routes. He must maintain his pace on vertical routes while waiting for his quarterback to \nthrow the ball. Otherwise, he has let up too much and the ball arrives past him.  \nPrather will stack a defender in the vertical game. He can wipe and stack within a few steps of the defender just as he’s \nbeginning his break on a deep go and the defender is over the top and tight to him.  \nRoute Stems: Prather widens stems to attack outside shade coverage. He’ll also run at the defender’s feet to turn the off-\ncoverage defender’s hips or dive inside. He’ll also run at the defender’s feet, get the defender to turn his hips and then take \nthe defender’s back.  \nRoute Setups: Prather has a good delay on the hitch portion of the hitch and go—fully squaring the quarterback out of the \nhitch part of the break and then spinning and shedding the defender over the top to get outside and down the field.  \nPrather has a hitch-and-go double move where he drops the weight and stutters but doesn’t turn fully on the hitch. The \nweight drop can be deeper—even if the college defenders are buying it.  \nPrather will show his eyes inside as he dives inside the stem against off-coverage in an attempt to set up the fade. \nHowever, this isn’t consistent enough and the lack of detail without the sale of the eyes and head tips off savvy defensive \nbacks playing off-coverage and they won’t bite on the fake. This gives them position to win the ball on vertical routes.  \nHe stair-steps in-breaking routes effectively against off coverage.  \nWhen he earns early separation and the defender is trailing, Prather has an effective stick to set up the defender that \nincludes the use of his head and eyes to sell the potential break before continuing downfield.  \nRoute Breaks: Prather has a long break step into his snap+2 break, but the actual turn can be sharper. The weight drop \ncan also be deeper.  \nOn speed breaks with a short break path, Prather’s drive step isn’t flat, but his line step his sharp enough to break back to \nthe ball. He gets his head around early out of the break.  \nPrather has a three-step break with a flat drive and line step. The weight drop could be deeper with breaks immediately \nback to the quarterback. The weight drop is better with breaks inside or outside. He has a sudden drop and pop break with \na sharp drive step and line step.  \nWhen Prather punches his sideline arm back through the turn, his breaks are unstoppable against tight coverage. He can \nput defenders on the ground when he does it. He should punch the arm back more often.   \nPrather’s drive and line steps can be flatter on speed breaks to the inside.  \nPrather earns a good snap with his turns. His speed breaks are better than his hard breaks on intermediate routes. Still, his \nintermediate curl has all of the elements you want with a hard break if the weight drop was a little deeper.  \nZone Routes: Prather identifies the second level of the defense, works to depth, and settles into the open area – including \ntight zones. He adjusts well to maximize his position while remaining friendly to the target.  \nPrather will tempo breaks and when he’s nearing a defender at the opposite side of the zone, he settles with a friend \nposition to the quarterback.  \nPrather doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he passes the rollover/buzz defender.  \nWhen the first break doesn’t earn a target, Prather will work to the next open zone.  \nRoute Boundary: Prather extends and drags one leg for targets away from his frame so he stays in bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Prather’s deep tracking may be a problem. He either loses the ball or he doesn’t gauge the trajectory of the \nball until it’s too late to change course. He can track a target over his shoulder to the inside, but he has miss-tracked two \ndeep posts in three games viewed.  \nWith shallow targets, Prather extends his arms fully first before leaving his feet—good tracking in this range. Prather can \nmake catches with underhand attack with his hands tighter to his frame.  \n\n \n123 \nHe has late hands on back-shoulder fades on vertical routes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Prather can extend overhand below his beltline to meet a target on an out route at its earliest \nwindow. He also extends overhand high and away from his frame without leaving his feet while breaking across the middle.  \nHe’s good at catching the ball at the earliest window. He’ll also make full-extension attempts with overhand position.  \nPosition: Prather must be more conscientious about using a pullback and embracing the fall against tight coverage on \nvertical routes. He has lost the ball because he didn’t do both after initially tracking it into his hands over his shoulder.  \nPrather can make a late turn to the ball arriving at the opposite shoulder he’s looking over so he can make the catch. He \nwould be better off working on a jump up and through, but this is a nice display of tracking.  \nHe has shown that he can embrace the fall with vertical targets where he’s facing the quarterback at the catch. He can also \nexecute the pull back.  \nPrather must use jump up and through technique more often with targets so he can attack vertical routes with overhand \nposition and give himself position and control to get his feet inbounds. Otherwise, he’s attacking out of control and has \nmore difficulty landing inside the boundary.  \nWhen he uses it, he can win over the top of defenders at his back hip with a good high-point.  \nFocus: Prather can take a hit to his back as he extends his arms with overhand position for a low target. He can take a hit \nto the front of his legs on the hitch.  \nTransitions: Prather catches and pierces when facing the quarterback at the catch point.  \nElusiveness: Prather needs 2-3 steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill path to the far side of the field.  \nVision: Prather makes wise decisions during the two-minute drill when near the boundary. There are decision-making \nlapses where Prather bounces runs outside when he should have split defenders within range of the first-down marker.  \nPower: Prather keeps his pads low to get under oncoming hits from pursuit playing over the top of him. He can keep his \nfeet moving through contact and push defensive backs downfield. Prather pulls through lower-leg wraps.  \nPrather’s stiff-arm is good enough to ward off reaches and dip away from the pursuit.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Prather wins direct collisions with cornerbacks.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nBall Security: Prather carries the ball high to his chest and with his elbow tight to his side. He tucks the ball under his right \narm even when working to the left side of the field, but this is more of a lapse than a bad habit. He uses either arm.  \nPrather can take contact to the ball. He covers the ball with both arms when entering traffic.  \nBlocking: When Prather gets a defender off-balance with his footwork, he will strike with a hard double jab and drop the \nopponent to the ground. He also has a double-uppercut motion but he doesn’t roll through the hips or get tight enough to \nthe defender to deliver it this way.  \nPrather overextends into contact. However, he’s quick-twitch as an athlete and he does a good job of regaining a squat and \nsquare stance, shuffling his feet, and remaining in position after he makes contact.  \nPrather is strong enough to work against the defender with his upper body to re-orient his lower body. His works his hands \ntight into the defender and aim for the chest. He sustains blocks effectively against cornerbacks.  \nHe handles redirects with good quickness and eventually earns a position where he can drive the defender away from the \nball carrier.  \nHe’s a patient and productive stalk blocker who takes his time to earn position when he has it and can effectively engage \nand turn the opponent.  \n\n \n124 \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Prather could emerge as a second or third option in a starting rotation by his second \nseason and earn 500-700 yards as the third option or 700-900 yards as the second option. I’m betting on the lower \nnumber. He’s a worthwhile consideration in the fourth round or later because I’m skeptical he’ll reach the high end of his \nceiling.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStance, Read Step, Acceleration, Tracking \n• \nStacks, Tracks, No Pull Back, No Embracing the Fall \n• \nSecond Miss-Tracked Deep Post in Three Games \n• \nDouble-Move, Late Hands, But Poor Position and Attack \n• \nFoot-switch, Jump Up And Thru, Highpoint, and Embrace the Fall \n• \nTrigger-Step and Double-Up \n• \nObeying the Ball \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n125",
        "analysis": "Kaden Prather is a WR prospect ranked 16th by RSP, standing at 6'3\" and 204 lbs.  His game is compared to a spectrum of NFL receivers: Tee Higgins (size and contested catch ability), Mike Williams (size and deep threat potential), and Alec Pierce (speed and route running). His Depth of Talent Score suggests he'll be a rotational starter.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Sure hands:**  Exhibits excellent ball tracking and catching ability, particularly on shorter routes and in contested situations.  A low drop rate is highlighted.\n* **Route running:** Possesses a good variety of release moves and shows promise in his route setups, although refinement is needed.  He excels at speed breaks and in creating separation within the first 8-10 yards.  Effective in both man and zone coverage scenarios, although consistency is an issue.\n* **Physicality:** Wins in contested catches and can work through contact after the catch.  He’s also a willing and effective blocker.\n* **Improved Release:** Showed significant improvement in his release throughout the 2024 season, reducing wasted movement.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refining Route Running:** Needs to add more detail to his route setups to consistently deceive NFL-level defenders.  Improving consistency in his eye usage and head fakes will be crucial.\n* **Deep Ball Tracking:**  Improving his deep ball tracking and adjusting his positioning for better trajectory judgment. This is currently a weakness.\n* **After the Catch:** While not a dynamic runner, improving his YAC ability could significantly boost his NFL value.\n* **Consistency:** Becoming more consistent with his releases and route running, especially against more sophisticated defenses.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons & Rationale:**\n\n* **Tee Higgins:**  Shares the size and ability to win contested catches, but Higgins is generally considered a more polished and consistent route runner at this stage.\n* **Mike Williams:**  Similar size and deep threat potential, but Williams' physicality is more pronounced.\n* **Alec Pierce:** Overlaps in terms of speed and route-running ability, but Pierce is possibly a bit more explosive.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nPrather projects as a possession receiver who can contribute early in his career as a rotational player. His ceiling depends on his ability to improve his consistency in route running and deep ball tracking.  He has the physical tools and some refined skills to become a reliable contributor, with the potential to develop into a solid second or third option in an NFL offense. The comparison to Josh Palmer is apt; a player who may not immediately start but has the potential to become a significant contributor later in his career.\n"

His release work has a variety of maneuvers, but he must develop some artistry to execute them convincingly. \nHe gets pinned to the boundary too often at this point.  \n \n\n \n126 \nGeorge’s route setups have more craft and most his breaks are technically sound. He’ll get open as a zone receiver and \ninside against man coverage.  \n \nOther than targets arriving over his head where he’s prone to clap-attacking, George has sound attack of the ball and he \nfrequently catches the ball at the earliest point of arrival. He has no issues as a tracker of the ball, keeping his feet on the \nground with targets where leaping isn’t necessary.  \n \nAfter the catch, George is precise, creative, and agile. When encountering contact, he gets his pads under the pursuit and \nrarely takes a big hit.  \n \nIf George develops a strong perimeter route game, he could deliver in a role along the lines of Jordan Addison. While \npossible, I’m skeptical he develops his much.  \n \nIt’s more likely George can be a middle-class Titus Young in ability—a big-play slot receiver who can occasional match up \nwith a defender outside. George may lack Young’s high-end talent, but he can become a reliable slot receiver who earns \n500-700 yards a season during his tenure. \n \nReleases: George has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms rest at either side \nof his front knee. He sinks into his stance to begin his release. His pads come over his knees and he rolls off his front foot.  \nGeorge is prone to rocking off his back foot after he sinks into his stance. It’s best if he curtails this bad habit so he’s more \nefficient against man-to-man coverage. There are some releases into run blocking assignments where George doesn’t rock \noff the back foot, but he also doesn’t sink into his stance.  \nBy the Wake Forest game, George improved enough where he sank into his stance without rocking his back foot.  \nGeorge counters the hands of inside leverage with a wipe or shed. He uses a stutter wipe at the top of his stem to set up a \nbreak inside.  \nGeorge uses a two-quick with a shed combo. None of the release methods listed above demonstrated the appropriate blend \nof patience and suddenness to execute with expertise.  \nThe lack of artistry allows defenders the angle to pin George to the boundary and ride him out of bounds early in a route. \nConsidering how quick he is – 6.77-second 3-Cone drill at the NFL Combine – George should be optimizing this quickness \nwith pacing changes.  \nHe has a swat-swim to counter the hands of a defender playing outside leverage.  \nGeorge uses a feet-switch to steal a release in the running game. He also uses a combination of a hesitation and a read \nstep. Another method he uses to steal a release is a read step with a three-quick to break inside.  \nGeorge has a sudden two-quick to the inside paired with a violent swat of the outside arm to work outside the defender. He \ncombines a read step with a two-quick and counters with a double swat to get inside.  \nGeorge uses a hesitation at the top of stems to set up breaks. He uses a double up to the outside to set up a break inside.  \nGeorge combines a two-quick and trigger step to set up a break back to the QB on a tunnel screen. He combines a two-\nquick, three-quick, and stick to set up a short in-breaking route off this diamond release.  \nHe also uses the trigger step mid-stem against off-coverage on a short curl.  \nGeorge is capable of delivering a hip shift at the top of stems against off-coverage to set up an in-breaking route.  \nSeparation: George has the acceleration to earn 1-2 steps on a cornerback on routes 25-40 yards past the line of \nscrimmage. He’ll work hard to stack a defender to set up a double-move. He can also stack within the first 10 yards.  \nRoute Stems: George dives against inside leverage. He’ll run direct at the defender playing a cushion of 7-10 yards and do \nso at partial speed to set up an acceleration through his break.  \nGeorge widens stems against outside leverage and a safety over the top to move the safety further outside on a vertical \nroute that he breaks to the post.  \n\n \n127 \nHe attacks stems at a fast pace and his arms move at nearly the full range of motion.  \nRoute Setups: George will use a stutter-wipe combination to set up an outside leverage defender to keep his hips inside as \nGeorge takes the back of the defender to the outside.  \nGeorge plays with pacing to set up off-coverage. He’ll use an inset with a head fake to set up a fade against off-coverage. \nHe’ll also do the same with the peek to the boundary before breaking downhill and using a wipe to counter the hands of the \noutside leverage defender.  \nRoute Breaks: George has a drop and pop break and transitions into a turn inside with flat drive and line steps. George \nhas a long break step. His weight drop on the drop and pop is partial. He can go deeper to execute it with greater \nsuddenness.  \nGeorge flips his hips effectively off combination footwork to earn separation against tight coverage.  \nGeorge gets his head around to the quarterback as he makes his break. If his break doesn’t earn a target, George tempos \nacross the zone and if nothing comes of it, he’ll work with the quarterback on the scramble drill to another open area.  \nGeorge uses a long break step into weight drop and a three-step break. He works back to the quarterback out of the break \nwith a friendly position.  \nZone Routes: George identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles in the open area with a friendly \nposition to the quarterback. He tempos his breaks across zones and waits until he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender to \nshow his eyes.  \nRoute Boundary: George can high-point and toe tap both feet inbounds as he works across the field.  \nPass Tracking: George tracks the ball over his shoulder with underhand attack on post routes. He can high-point. He also \ndisplays willingness to attack overhand targets at the earliest window. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for the ball.  \nGeorge can turn to his back hip and catch the ball with underhand attack. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily to catch \nthe football unless it’s a shallow target like a tunnel screen where he’s breaking back to the quarterback.  \nHands/Catch Radius: George can high-point the football. He can leave his feet to do so as well as maintain his footing.  \nHe’s prone to clap-attacking targets over his head, especially with defenders looming. George digs out low throws he must \ndive toward.  \nPosition: George embraces the fall on low throws he has to dig out.  \nFocus: George can extend high and away from his frame with a defender tight to his back and wrapping. He can high-point \nand take a hard hit to the back.  \nTransitions: George adheres to catch and pierce principles, but he has lapses where he stops his feet after catching with \nhis break path to the outside and squares up the defender. He’ll even retreat a step or two in an attempt to use his short-\narea quickness to fake the defender over the top. The results are minimal.  \nElusiveness: George uses sticks, dips, and stop-start moves like trigger steps to earn angles against defenders where he’s \nmatched up one-on-one in the open field. His spins are tight and on a dime. He can defeat a linebacker on top of him at the \ncatch point with the suddenness and tightness of the move. \nGeorge only needs one step to transition downhill on a perimeter play. He has excellent hip mobility and curvilinear \nmovement to work around box defenders on smoke screens and access cutbacks for long gains.  \nGeorge kicks his heels away from low shots in traffic and gets his knees high to step over obstacles.  \nVision: George will press an unblocked defender to set up his blocker on gap over. He will press inside to set up cutbacks to \nthe outside.  \nPower: George uses low pad level to work under hits in traffic and force wraps where he can pull forward. He can pull \nthrough reaches to his back and wraps to his lower leg.  \n\n \n128 \nGeorge doesn’t use the stiff arm often, but he has enough extension and timing to ward off wraps to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: When his pads are low, and the cornerback is moving laterally, George can knock the defender \non his back. He still doesn’t run through the wrap. George also bounces off direct hits from cornerbacks hitting his legs.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: George also takes glancing shots to his side from cornerbacks and keeps his feet moving until \nwrapped and pulled to the ground.  \nBall Security: George carries the ball high to his chest and uses the arm that’s away from the closest pursuit. His elbow \ngets wide from his side.  \nBlocking: George earns a flat position against linebackers and safeties on Man Over Me assignments. When the defender’s \nback is to George, George adjusts his position so he strikes the defender in the chest and seals the opponent to the outside \nrather than blocking the opponent in the back in an attempt to seal inside.  \nGeorge earns a square and squat position. He moves his feet well and delivers a push with his hands tight to the spot where \nhe makes contact with the defender.  \nWith Man Over Me assignments, George must exhibit greater patience with his approach. He gets too close to the defender \nwithout allowing the defender to meet him halfway, this tips off his path and allows the defender to work past.  \nGeorge is aggressive with his attack of linebackers when executing Most Dangerous Man assignments. He’ll take the \ndefender’s outside shoulder after approaching inside and attempt to turn the opponent away from the ball carrier. He can \npush/pull a linebacker off-balance when attacking from his indirect angle—catching the defender by surprise.  \nGeorge doesn’t win collisions with defenders who have downhill momentum. He’s a speed bump without timing a good \nstrike, which he doesn’t do. George is good at taking a defender’s momentum and using it in George’s favor to turn the \nopponent elsewhere.  \nGeorge doesn’t wildly overextend his frame into his opponents, but enough that savvy defenders can earn a quick \nadvantage. He tips off Man Over Me assignments with his overextensions.  \nHe understands which shoulder to take when attacking the force player or sealing a defender outside. It’s surprising how \noften he sustains blocks for his size.  \nDurability: A broken thumb in 2022 cost George multiple games.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: We’re entering a glut of receivers who are mostly good enough to contribute right now, \nbut lack enough refinement to emerge as starters for at least another year or two, and there’s no promise most of them will \ndevelop enough to make this promise a reality.  \n \nGeorge could be one of these options. At worst, he’ll become a playable matchup starter during bye weeks when asked to \ntake on a bigger role due to injury. At best, George could become a weekly fantasy start with big-play upside.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHigh-point and Toe Tap \n• \nTwo-Quick, Three-Quick, Stick, Hip Flip, Drive and Line Steps, Caught vs. Tight Coverage \n• \nHitch and Poor Transition Decision \n• \nHitch and Good Transition Decision \n• \nManipulates DB in Stem, Takes Back, Tracking w/out Leaving Feet \n• \nImproved Release Work, Stems Defender, High-Points, Hit, Embraces Fall \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n129",
        "analysis": "Jacolby George is a WR prospect ranked 17th by RSP, possessing a blend of quickness and ball-winning ability, but with significant room for development.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Quickness and Agility:**  Exceptional speed and agility, evidenced by a 6.77-second 3-Cone drill. This allows him to create separation, particularly in short-to-intermediate routes and after the catch.  He's creative and precise after the catch, avoiding big hits.\n* **Ball Skills:**  Sound ball tracking and frequently catches the ball at its earliest point of arrival.  He can high-point the ball and make difficult catches.  He has a 100% catch rate on \"pinpoint\" targets.\n* **Slot Receiver Ability:**  Excels at winning tough targets in the middle of the field and is best suited for a slot or inside receiver role.\n* **Route Running (Developing):** Shows craft in his route setups and technically sound breaks, effective against zone coverage and inside against man coverage.  He has a variety of release techniques, but needs to improve consistency and artistry.\n* **Blocking (Developing):** Shows potential in run blocking, though needs to improve patience and timing on Man Over Me assignments.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Perimeter Route Development:**  If he develops a strong perimeter game, he has the potential to reach a higher level of production, akin to Jordan Addison.  However, this is considered less likely.\n* **Release Consistency:**  Improving his release techniques will allow him to consistently beat press coverage and avoid getting pinned to the boundary.\n* **Overall Refinement:** With refinement of his route running and release techniques, he can maximize his already impressive speed and agility.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Consistency:** While possessing the tools, he lacks the polish and consistency to be an immediate starter. His route running needs artistry and he's prone to \"clap-attacking\" high balls.\n* **Perimeter Game:**  His game is currently heavily reliant on inside routes.  Developing his outside game is key to reaching his ceiling.\n* **Durability:** A history of injuries (broken thumb) is a concern.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report offers a wide range of comparisons, reflecting his potential for varying outcomes:\n\n* **High-End Potential (Less Likely):** Jordan Addison – suggests a high-level potential if he significantly improves his route running and perimeter game.\n* **More Likely Outcome:** Titus Young – a comparison to a productive slot receiver with occasional outside ability, but potentially lacking Young's elite talent.\n* **Other Comparisons:** DeSean Jackson (speed, big-play ability), Cedrick Wilson (versatility),  though these comparisons are less specific about his play style and are not as strongly emphasized.  The \"X\" suggests uncertainty.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nJacolby George has the physical tools and some refined skills to be a productive NFL receiver.  However, his development will significantly impact his ultimate success.  His floor is a rotational player/matchup starter, but his ceiling is a reliable starter with big-play potential if he addresses his weaknesses.  His potential is significant, but he faces challenges in refining his game.\n"

He’s a tough receiver who can work over the middle, up the seam, or turn hospital balls into completions. \n \nI can see it now. Cue the Saints season opener… \n \nChris Olave slowly rises from a hit that was a last-second duck of the head shy being decapitated. He turns to \nJackson on his way back to the huddle.  \n\n \n130 \n \nOlave: See what I’m saying? Keep your wits about you, rook.  \n \nDerek Carr gets the call from the sideline. Mesh concept with Jackson as part of the mesh.  \n \nJackson: Hold my beer, Olave…. \n \nCarr leads Jackson into a middle linebacker. Helmets fly. The crowd gasps. Carr acts like it’s another day at the \noffice. (The trains must run on schedule, he thinks to himself.)  \n \nJackson pops up and signals first down.  \n \nJackson: Is that all you got, Carr? Too bad Payton isn’t still here paying bounties. You could lead me into Derwin \nJames next week, Bubba. We’ll get mismatches from 10 personnel for the rest of the game. Just watch the knees, \nBoss.  \n \nJokes aside, Jackson has the elements of a tough slot receiver who is just fast enough to get time as a flanker. He’s a \nstrong route runner with short-area explosion who gets separation inside and outside against man and zone coverage.  \n \nAfter the catch, Jackson has good feel for pursuit and maintains a downfield mentality while routinely making the first man \nmiss with efficient moves. He’s a modern-day Wayne Chrebet with hands manufactured at Hoover’s top-secret laboratory.  \n \nConceptual: He must develop some feel for when to execute a jump-up-and-through technique on back-shoulder fades. He \ndoesn’t do it at all and has had multiple targets where it would have helped him earn a catch.  \nReleases: Jackson has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either \nside of his front leg. He’ll release with no wasted motion rolling off his front foot but could sink into his stance. He leans \nforward a little awkwardly rather than sinking. He has lapses where he rocks off his back foot.  \nJackson did a better job of sinking into his stance as the 2024 season unfolded.  \nJackson has a patient and sudden read step to set up an outside shade defender to get inside. He counters the read step \nwith a shed.  \nJackson uses a patient two-quick combined with a sudden hip shift against shallow off-man coverage to steal a release in \nthe run game. He’ll also use a sudden two-quick with a stick inside to set up the fade outside on a run play to steal a \nrelease.  \nAnother way Jackson steals a release is a feet-switch to earn position inside and cut off the Man Over Me assignment.  \nThe patience and suddenness with Jackson’s hesitation earns him separation against off-coverage. He also uses the hip shift \neffectively against off-coverage to break outside. He uses the two-quick against tight man coverage and earns separation \noutside with a shed counter. He also uses a two-quick with a swat-swim counter to get up the seam between zone \ndefenders.  \nHis three-quick works to get inside. He also uses a stutter release to work inside. Jackson uses a two-quick and a wipe \ncounter to get outside. Jackson has an effective stick-swat combination up the seam and a stick-shed to get outside to the \nboundary. The stick has good balance between patience and suddenness. His sheds and wipes are violent.  \nJackson uses a hip shift with a shoulder reduction when slanting inside against off coverage. He’ll also use a read step and a \ndouble up as a combination  \nJackson has an effective blade release (shoulder reduction and shed) against off coverage. He has a lean-in to set up out-\nbreaking routes against tight inside coverage.  \nJackson has a sudden trigger step to set up an RPO, screen, and even the top of a stem on a fade.  \nSeparation: Jackson has the acceleration to read the far-side edge on a perimeter play as a runner.  \nRoute Stems: Jackson will widen or dive stems against zone coverage. He’ll also run at the defender and get into the \ndefender’s toes/heels and then take the defender’s back.  \n\n \n131 \nRoute Setups: Jackson will widen a defender playing outside shade, deliver a patient double up and then sprint downfield \nto stair-step the defender and punctuate the route with an inset before executing a speed out.  \nHis pacing with stair-steps inside or outside is excellent against off-coverage. Jackson has an effective peek at the top of his \nstems to sell the fade before breaking to the inside while using a stair-step technique.  \nJackson must develop a better plan for fades where he’s aligned outside the numbers and the cornerback is also outside the \nnumbers using outside shade. Jackson must be willing to set up the defender with an inside stem so he’s not run out of \nbounds.  \nRoute Breaks: Jackson has a flat drive step on the speed out but the line step drifts. He gets his head around to the \nquarterback out of his break.  \nJackson has a long break step into a three-step break with some weight drop, but he needs to drop his weight more. He \nworks out of the break back to the target.  \nThe only instance I’ve seen Jackson snap his break is off a lean-in on a shallow out against a Michigan defender. He \npunched the boundary arm to generate snap. His drive step and line steps were also flat. This must become routine than an \nexception to his game.  \nAs the season progressed, Jackson’s speed breaks had flatter drive and line steps—short and intermediate in range.  \nZone Routes: Jackson settles in the open area of zone with a friendly target. He tempos his breaks between defenders.  \nWhen Jackson doesn’t earn a target with his initial break and/or the quarterback breaks the pocket, Jackson works with the \nquarterback to find an open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Jackson is aware of the boundary and drags his feet near the boundary. He can high-point with a back-\nshoulder turn and get one foot inbounds, but he must improve the timing of his leaps so he isn’t forced to kick his back leg \nout to land and miss getting the second foot inbounds.  \nHe’ll extend across the end line and keep both feet back to toe-tap and/or drag against tight coverage.  \nPass Tracking: He can make late back-shoulder turns and high-points. He leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets with his \nback to the downhill defender and the targets is at his waist or numbers.  \nJackson tracks over the shoulder against tight coverage and hard contact to his chest. He also tracks over his shoulder and \nmakes one-handed catches in stride to the boundary-side arm with tight coverage making contact to his back.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Jackson catches the ball with underhand position wide of his waistline. He uses overhand position at \nthe numbers. He attacks at the earliest point in both scenarios. He high-points on back-shoulder turns. He digs out low \nthrows below the knees in tight coverage, cutting off the defender at his back to earn the ball.  \nJackson doesn’t drop many targets but when he does, he uses underhand attack at the numbers instead of overhand and it \ncan result in him tipping the ball as he tries clap-trapping it to his frame. Otherwise, he’s a vacuum cleaner of a receiver \nwho wins the ball if he can get one hand fully on it.  \nPosition: Jackson is adept at earning position between the ball and the defender so he forces the defender to interfere. At \nthe same time, Jackson could become more adept at undercutting the defender on a vertical route to jump up and through \nso he can make the catch rather than draw the foul.  \nJackson gave up an interception in 2024 against a Michigan defensive back at his back hip on a fade where he had a lot of \ntime to judge when to execute a jump up and through, but didn’t do so.  \nJackson extends wide for the ball and executes a pull-back. He’ll also embrace the fall. He’ll also execute the pullback off a \nhigh-point.  \nFocus: Jackson can catch underhand targets at his waist with tight coverage at his back and delivering contact as well as \nwith tight coverage to his chest and making contact. Jackson can also take a hard shot to the chest as he turns through the \ncatch point of a throw at helmet level.  \nTransitions: Jackson has effective catch-and-pierce position. He obeys the direction of the ball.   \n\n \n132 \nElusiveness: Jackson has a tight enough spin at the boundary to stay in the field of play against a defender tight to him. \nHe can spin away from a defender at his back or over the top – inside or outside. He can sidestep defenders in tight traffic.  \nVision: Jackson has a good feel for which way to turn when transitioning downhill base on the position of coverage at this \nback. He finds the soft spot to open space. He makes at least one man miss in tight traffic.  \nJackson maintains a downhill mentality when it’s too risky to attempt a bounce or cutback. He can avoid penetration into \nthe rushing lane and correct course downhill after mitigating the loss with a juke.  \nJackson is patient with downhill pursuit penetrating his immediate area, allowing the defender to shoot for Jackson before \nJackson begins any movement to avoid it. He’s better at setting up unblocked defenders with a press and cutback than he is \nwith some reps with blocks.  \nJackson can be more patient and set up cutbacks behind his blocks downfield. He has missed opportunities to extend plays \nanother 20-30 yards that could have turned into touchdowns.  \nPower: Jackson can pull through reaches to his lower legs and wraps to his upper body. He uses a stiff arm to swat past \nreaches.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Jackson bounces off hard contact to his chest from a safety.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots to his pads from safeties. He has an effective balance-touch.  \nBall Security: Jackson carries the ball high to his chest and with his elbow tight to his frame. He covers the ball with both \nhands tight to his chest in traffic.  \nJackson can take contact to the ball. If a defender gets both hands on the ball while Jackson is fighting through a wrap, he \nhas had the ball pulled free.  \nJackson can carry the ball under either arm, but he uses his right arm most often – the first time I saw him use his left arm \nup the boundary was 5 games and 11 plays into my film study.  \nBlocking: Jackson breaks down into a squat and square stance. He can improve his lateral movement. Instead of walking \nor trotting to the open spot and overrunning the defender and/or losing his square position, he must shuffle his feet while \nstill in that square position.  \nJackson will work toward the linebacker on a run play and square the defender. He doesn’t punch and instead takes the \ncontact that knocks him upward and backward. He’s good at earning a square position inside against a safety. He’ll close \nthe gap and underhook to turn.  \nJackson earns a square and tight position against the force defender and delivers his hands with his elbows bent. He also \ndoes this but with a wide position against safeties on Most Dangerous Man assignments to the inside. He’s good at getting \ntight and sustaining blocks against safeties in the box. He can also shield the defensive end and run him around the path of \nthe back in the box.  \nJackson will run off a defender and then tilt into that defender to transition from route runner to blocker. When his \nquarterback scrambles, Jackson transitions fast from receiver to blocker.  \nDurability: Missed the 2022 opener with a lower leg injury suffered in camp. No significant time missed.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If I were to consider a slot receiver available in the middle-to-late rounds of rookie drafts, \nJackson is near the top of my short list. His ability to work as a flanker gives me hope that he can deliver 70-80 catches as \na starter as well as a shot at 5-7 touchdowns because his skills should translate well to the red zone.  \n \nIf not, the cost should be low enough to move on within 18-24 months.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nWiden stem, double up, sudden stair-step, inset, and speed out.  \n• \nStair-step and pacing \n• \nThree-step break, tight coverage, boundary awareness \n• \nRead-step, double-up, dig-out, tight coverage.  \n\n \n133 \n• \nDrop and Pop, High-Point, Pull-Back \n• \nOver the Shoulder, Hard Hit in Chest \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n134",
        "analysis": "Daniel Jackson is a gritty, tough slot receiver with the potential to also play flanker.  His strengths lie in his strong route running, particularly his ability to create separation inside and outside using a variety of releases and counters (including a patient read step, two-quick, three-quick, stutter, and various counters like shed, swim, and wipe). He displays excellent short-area explosion and excels at tracking the ball, even in tight coverage and after taking significant hits.  He's highly reliable in contested catches and possesses impressive hands (\"hands manufactured at Hoover's top-secret laboratory\"), exhibiting a high catch percentage despite taking punishment over the middle.  His after-the-catch ability includes making defenders miss and maintaining a downfield mentality. He is also a willing and capable blocker, showing good technique and aggressiveness.\n\n**Opportunities:** Jackson needs to improve his back-shoulder fade technique – he currently doesn't employ a jump-up-and-through technique, leading to missed opportunities.  He can refine his route running further by consistently using flatter drive and line steps in his speed breaks, and developing a better plan for fades against outside shade coverage. Improving his patience and setup for cutbacks after the catch could lead to significant yardage gains.  Finally, while already a good blocker, improving his lateral movement and punch would enhance this aspect of his game.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** The scouting report explicitly compares him to Wayne Chrebet, highlighting his toughness and ability to excel in the slot.  His size and playing style suggest a potential comparison to other smaller, tough slot receivers who excel at catching contested passes.  Considering his ability to play both slot and flanker, he may also have some traits reminiscent of players like Cole Beasley (though potentially with more physicality).\n\n\n**Overall:**  Jackson profiles as a valuable mid-to-late-round draft pick with a high floor due to his reliability and toughness.  His versatility and potential for growth suggest that he could develop into a significant contributor in an NFL offense. While he doesn't possess elite speed or size, his strong hands, route-running ability, and willingness to take a hit make him a compelling prospect.\n"

If he has a 10-year career, he might even benefit from a broken \ncoverage or two and have a handful of field-flipping plays.  \n \nRestrepo has enough tools to release from the line in two-way-go scenarios with defenders. He’s quick enough to find and \ncreate space against zone coverage.  \n \n\n \n135 \nAgainst man-to-man, Restrepo doesn’t decelerate fast enough and his turns and breaks lack precision and snap. This will be \nmore important in short-yardage passing scenarios on third and fourth-down where a quarterback will be relying on him \nmore often as the first or second read and not just an outlet or check-down.  \n \nRestrepo has strong hands at the catch point. As long as he maximizes the separation he can earn with underneath routes, \nhe will put himself in advantageous situations to win the ball.  \n \nA short-term concern for Restrepo’s pass-catching is that when targets aren’t pinpoint, his technique breaks-down. Targets \narriving high and away or low and behind Restrepo can short-circuit his attack and he resorts to clap-attacks that lead to \ndrops.  \n \nWhen Restrepo earns the ball and transitions downhill, he’s a shifty, patient, and mature decision-maker as a runner. \nThanks to his size, he’s a little more powerful than the average “small slot” option.  \n \nIt might take a couple of years for Restrepo to earn the slot role for a team. His hands and his routes could be reasons that \nhis career plateaus as a reserve. He’s still good enough to add value to a team in either capacity.  \n \nTechnical: Restrepo has some arm talent for option passes. He can deliver the ball 25-35 yards downfield and do it on the \nmove.  \nReleases: Restrepo begins with a staggered stance. His weight distribution is 80/20 to his front foot. His arms hang at \neither side of his front knee.  \nRestrepo can do more to sink into his stance and sell the vertical – he comes off the line a little high. His pads are over his \nknees and there is no wasted motion.  \nWhen an off-coverage defender shoots his hands, Restrepo will reduce the shoulder from the contact. He’ll also use a wipe \nas a counter. Restrepo also uses a blade release.  \nRestrepo uses a foot-switch to pivot outside a defender playing tight coverage over him. It’s a patient but sudden move. He \nhas a read-step and wipe combo against outside-shade coverage, but can get hung up by the defender. He also has a \nhesitation and stick combo.  \nRestrepo uses a double up to the inside at the top of a stem against off-coverage playing the shallow speed out. He uses a \nhesitation and wipe combo on deep overs against man coverage. He also uses the hesitation and a two-quick as a method \nof stealing a release in the run game. There’s good patience and suddenness with this combo. \nHe has a double-up and stick combo with a shed counter. He also as a throw-by off a stick.  \nRestrepo uses a shed but uses it more to brace himself against the defender through the stem before snapping the turn on \nhis break. He uses the hip shift effectively when working routes with a diagonal stem.  \nSeparation: Restrepo has the acceleration and speed to beat a linebacker on a deep over route, but a cornerback on the \nbreak-side of the field can recover and close the gap after the receiver’s break.  \nRestrepo lacks top speed. An athletic defensive tackle can pursue up the boundary and run him down if Restrepo must \nadjust his stride and decelerate to avoid pursuit over the top. He’ll extend the run 30-40 yards, but an athletic tackle an get \nclose enough for the tackle opportunity.  \nRestrepo can use a pace change early to set up a two-quick and earn separation against outside shade on a route breaking \ninside.  \nHe will stack a defender he beats in off coverage on an intermediate or vertical route with a vertical stem. He lacks great \nspeed, but if he can earn the position, he’ll do it.  \nIf he extends a run, it’s in wide open field and he gets blocking and/or he finds a cutback lane to veer away from pursuit.  \nRoute Stems: Restrepo will stem inside, diving toward the inside leverage of off-coverage. He’ll widen outside as well as \nrun toward the feet of the defender.  \n\n \n136 \nRoute Setups: Restrepo will use a peek or inset to set up breaks inside or outside based on the coverage. He’ll stair-stem \nhis stems to set up breaks. His pace changes to set up sticks or other footwork helps him earn separation on underneath \nroutes.  \nRoute Breaks: Restrepo gets his head around to the quarterback out of speed breaks to the outside. His speed breaks on \nintermediate outs drift downfield. His drive and line steps aren’t flat enough.  \nOn shallow outs, Restrepo has a flat drive step. His first line step drives, but the second line step is flat and compensates. \nHe gets his head around and creates a friendly target for the quarterback as he runs away from the defender during the \nbreak.  \nI need to see him snap his turns on timing routes. He’ll snap the turn in in-breaking routes with a defender tight to him \nafter stair-stepping the stem. He punches his boundary-side arm.  \nRestrepo exhibits weight drop with whip routes, but I need to see him decelerate faster. His break step and weight drop on \nintermediate routes must be sharper. Right now it’s better when facing off-coverage over the top of him than tight coverage \nat his hip.  \nHe loses balance out of breaks and dynamic changes of direction associated with weight drop.  \nZone Routes: Restrepo notices when an underneath defender is covering up his break and works to the open zone for his \nquarterback. He tempos his break and maintains a friendly target for his passer.  \nWhen dealing with a corner blitz, Restrepo understands the depth of the zone defender over the top and settles into the \nopen area, creating a friendly target.  \nRoute Boundary: He can drag his feet inside the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Restrepo tracks the ball over his shoulder. He makes late turns on back-shoulder routes and attacks with \nlate hands.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Restrepo has strong hands. He can attack behind his break path with full extension and snatch the \nball from a position over and behind his head and retract the target to his frame.  \nRestrepo uses underhand position with targets he allows close to his waistline. Restrepo has good enough bend and arm \nextension to attack targets at the height of his shins or shoe tops.  \nRestrepo can be guilty of clap-attacking targets arriving low and away from his frame—using high-low position and missing \nthe ball as it goes between his hands. The same is true with targets high and behind his frame demanding a difficult high-\npoint.  \nPosition: Restrepo embraces the fall after high-pointing. He executes an effective jump up and through against tight \ncoverage and has a good pull back.  \nFocus: Restrepo can take contact to his back as he extends with overhand position to catch the football. He can take a hard \nshot to his side and stomach out of a high-point.  \nTransitions: Restrepo catches and pierces downhill after attacking the ball while facing the quarterback. He has a good feel \nfor the coverage before the catch and turns in the best direction.  \nElusiveness: Restrepo has a tight spin out of his stance. He only needs two steps to decelerate and dip inside a safety’s \npursuit as he’s working up the boundary. Restrepo only needs two quick steps to decelerate while working across the field \nand then dip downhill.  \nHis stick and spin combination can get him away from multiple points of pursuit. His jump cuts aren’t explosive, but he uses \nthem wisely to work to the next crease when necessary.  \nVision: Restrepo identifies and reacts well to pursuit from over the top, finding the open space. He’s a patient runner who \ncan draw defenders to him with a press downhill and then spin to the open field.  \nHe also knows when to split defenders when trying to avoid them will cost him yardage. He can create against unblocked \npursuit.  \n\n \n137 \nPower: Restrepo can pull through lower-body reaches from linebackers. He drops his pads into oncoming safeties to ride \nover the top of the hit.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Restrepo has an effective balance-touch to work through contact and maintain his balance. He \nbounce off glancing shots from safeties to extend forward for additional yardage.  \nBall Security: Restrepo carries the ball high to his chest. He’ll use the arm that’s working away from the nearest pursuit. \nThe elbow is loose from his side.  \nBlocking: Restrepo earns a square and squat stance against defenders. He aims for the chest with his hands and his hands \nare tight, but he doesn’t close the gap as tight as he should and his arms are nearly locked out when he engages. Restrepo \nmoves his feet to maintain a square position during the block. \nWhen he’s patient with his stalk, he can close the gap and deliver his hands where his elbows are bent and he can sustain \nthe effort.  \nRestrepo is willing to shield a defensive end or outside linebacker to seal the edge on a run play. Because he uses a straight \njab or drops his pads into the defender as a method of strike, defenders beat Restrepo to the punch and knocked the \nreceiver off his spot early in a block.  \nRestrepo has an effective one-arm technique as the backside blocker tight to the formation. He can sustain an effort against \na defensive back with this method.  \nWhen attacking safeties on Most Dangerous Man assignments, Restrepo loads up his shoulder and forearm rather than \npunching with an uppercut. He closes the gap, but his method can tip off the defender. The loading up also leaves Restrepo \nin a position where he often winds up a one-and-done puncher or speed bump for the defender.  \nWhen this works, Restrepo can peel off his Man Over Me Assignment and level the safety.  \nRestrepo shuffles his feet effectively so he can slide laterally toward pursuit.  \nDurability: Foot injury in 2022 that limited him to seven games.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Although not far from earning a starter grade, Restrepo’s role could lead to season-long \nbox scores that are on par with fantasy TE2s. It’s wise to wait for the NFL’s referendum on Restrepo before drafting him in \nrookie drafts. \n \nRestrepo is a low-ceiling, high-floor option among a draft class with much more upside for the cost at wide receiver and \nother positions.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nXavier Restrepo: Zone Adjustment and Catch Radius \n• \nXavier Restrepo: Blitz Adjustment and Transition \n• \nPress, Stick-and-Spin to Open Grass, Caught by DT \n• \nWins 1-on-1, tracks over shoulder, drags at boundary \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n138",
        "analysis": "Xavier Restrepo is a slot receiver prospect with a high floor but a low ceiling.  His strengths lie in his reliable hands, particularly on pinpoint targets, and his savvy route running in underneath zones. He demonstrates good patience and decision-making as a runner after the catch, utilizing his size advantage for a smaller slot receiver. His release techniques are varied and effective against off-coverage, showing good understanding of zone concepts and adjusting accordingly.  He also possesses some arm talent for option passes.\n\nHowever, Restrepo's weaknesses include inconsistent route running against tight man coverage, lacking the elite speed and sharp breaks needed to consistently create separation. His technique falters when targets aren't precise, leading to drops. While he can extend runs, his top speed limits his ability to consistently outrun athletic defenders. His blocking, while willing, needs improvement in technique and consistency.  A foot injury history also raises some durability concerns.\n\n\n**Opportunities:** Restrepo's reliable hands and route-running prowess make him a valuable asset as a slot receiver, even if he might not immediately start.  He could find success in a system that utilizes a lot of short and intermediate routes. His ability to make plays after the catch provides added value.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The provided comparisons – Parker Washington, James Proche, Amari Rodgers, and Byron Marshall – suggest a career trajectory as a consistent but not necessarily spectacular slot receiver, potentially with a niche role as a reliable target in short-yardage situations.  He might be a player who contributes on special teams as well.  His ceiling is likely that of a solid backup or a consistent contributor in a limited role.\n"

If there is one it this class, it’s \nMumpfield.  \n \nAn all-freshman performer in the MAC at Akron, Mumpfield transferred to Pitt as a sophomore and became a fixture in the \nPanthers’ passing game. Despite minor lapses with underhand attack away from his frame, he’s one of the best pass-\ncatchers in this class.  \n\n \n139 \n \nMumpfield is an aerial acrobat with excellent tracking ability, hand-eye coordination, and body control in tight coverage and \nhis back to the football. He’s also tough enough at the catch-point to take hits over the middle after adjusting to targets \nthat aren’t pinpoint or require placement away from defenders.  \n \nThe acrobats of a college class aren’t always strong route runners, but Mumpfield is the exception. He has an excellent \ntoolbox of releases and incorporates savvy pacing to bait opposing defenders out of position.  \n \nThe same is true with Mumpfield’s setups and breaks. He often manipulates defenders to overrun the stem and earns a lot \nof separation back to the ball.  \n \nThis is the magic of quickness, pacing, deceleration, body control, and precision for route runners. Mumpfield is at least a \nstep or two slower than a lot of the top prospects in this class, but his timing routes create more open space than a lot of \nthem.  \n \nAfter the catch, Mumpfield is disappointing relative to what he does so well before he has to be a ball carrier. As an open-\nfield runner, he attempts moves and pacing changes that he incorporates into his routes, but they don’t have the same \nsuccess.  \n \nHe’ll make defenders miss, but not as frequently as his moves bait defenders out of position in coverage. Mumpfield’s work \nwith the ball in his hands isn’t as sudden.  \n \nHe lacks top-end explosion as an athlete and this has led the public to overlook him as a strong prospect. He’s on a mid-\nlevel ACC team and he has never had a season with 1,000 yards, 100 catches, or double-digit touchdowns.  \n \nOptics matter to the public and sometimes, too much to analysts in and out of the league.  \n \nMumpfield’s 4.59-second, 40-Yard Dash at the NFL Combine didn’t change the perception of those who never considered \nhim a worthwhile prospect in the first place. However, that mark is just inside the range of long speed for a starting flanker \nin the league. Considering I would have projected 4.65-4.7 as a worst-case scenario, Mumpfield’s performance is \nconfirmation that he was indeed fast enough on film to contribute in the NFL.  \n \nThe foundation for the RSP’s process for scouting talent is to track and measure the athletic ability, techniques, and \nconcepts a player uses that places himself and/or his teammates in a position to make plays. The results aren’t the numbers \nbut the processes that can lead to the numbers, but don’t necessarily happen that way.  \n \nA lot factors that lead people to overlook Mumpfield are results-driven and bad optics. The process-driven behaviors rooted \nin technique, athletic ability, and football concepts are directly from the field of play. When there’s dissonance between the \nfilm and the optics, you have a potential sleeper like Mumpfield.  \n \nReleases: Mumpfield has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang straight at \neither side of his front knee. He sinks into his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion. He has some lapses \nwhere he rocks off the back foot unnecessarily.  \nHis eyes and head are up as he comes off the line. His arms move at about half of the range of motion.  \nMumpfield reduces his shoulder from a defender’s hands during his stem.  \nMumpfield has a double up to attack outside leverage off the line and inside leverage at the top of stems. He uses a reads \nstep to attack outside leverage and counters with a shoulder reduction as he works inside.  \nHe uses a read step to steal a release in the run game and he can pair it with a patient hesitation to set up a more sudden \nread step. He also steals a release using a two-quick against inside leverage to set up a release outside. He counters the \ndefender’s hands with a wipe. \nMumpfield also counters his read steps with a double swat.  \nHe has a wide stick at the top of a stem that dives inside toward a safety over the top. The stick is wide enough to the \ninside to freeze the defender and then cross the defender’s face to open space.  \n\n \n140 \nHis read step and two-quick has a good combination of patience and suddenness. He counters with a wipe or a shed. Both \ncounters have violence.  \nMumpfield uses a feet switch to set up an inside release. He counters the defender’s hands to a feet switch with a shoulder \nreduction. \nHe uses the trigger step multiple times in a short release to set up a shallow in-breaker when stealing a release.  \nSeparation: Mumpfield has the release moves and acceleration to earn separation against off-man with intermediate and \nvertical routes. He will stack the defender.  \nRoute Stems: He will stem at a defender in the intermediate game who is playing over the top and squatting on the route. \nHe’ll also take the back of the defender as he accelerates at full speed toward the off-coverage defender during his stem.  \nRoute Setups: Mumpfield has an effective inset. He turns his hips and chest inside and shows his eyes inside. He also can \ndeliver a great double move off a speed turn to the outside that has sudden and flat drive steps and line steps off a double \nup before he breaks vertically. He sells the speed out with his entire body.  \nMumpfield excels at delivering stems and false breaks with a mix of patience and suddenness. He also excels and using \npace changes so he’s executing with lightning-quick suddenness at the top of stems.  \nMumpfield can stairstep the safety with a great stick inside the defender before working across his face at the break.  \nHe’ll stair-step inside and set up the off-coverage defender with a pace change into a hip shift for speed break inside.  \nThe choice of a hip shift at the top of a stem that he’s widening to set up an in-breaking route may not be best. It’s easy to \nslip when transitioning into the break, and that’s what he has done at least on one route against Boston College.  \nRoute Breaks: Mumpfield has a long break step and flat drive and line steps. He runs out his breaks and gets his head \naround early. He can drop his weight into the break step and transition into the speed break inside with the flat drive and \nline steps.  \nHe has a sudden drop and pop break with a long break step and weight drop. He creates a friendly target for his \nquarterback.  \nThe same is true with his three-step break with a long break step. He uses this break against off-coverage with a deep \ncushion to set up a hitch and go.  \nZone Routes: Mumpfield identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across open zones. \nHe doesn’t show his eyes until he breaks past the rollover/buzz defender.  \nMumpfield will also settle into the open area. If he doesn’t earn a target, he works to the next open area.  \nRoute Boundary:  Mumpfield buys space away from the boundary on fade routes and then fades late to the boundary. He \ncan toe-tap and tap and drag the boundary on the way down from a high-point.  \nPass Tracking: Mumpfield tracks the ball over his shoulder. He also tracks it over his head and behind his frame with late \nhands. He can leave his feet unnecessarily for targets thrown behind his break path and at shoulder level.  \nHe had one lapse against Clemson where he was late to attack a target breaking over the middle and it forced him to opt \nfor underhand attack as the ball flew past him. He should be attack at the earliest point before it reaches his body and use \noverhand position.  \nMumpfield displays late hands.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Mumpfield catches the ball with underhand position with targets at his waist. He uses overhand \nposition for targets wide of his frame.  \nWhen he has lapses, he’s trying to clap-trap with underhand position below the waist and he fights the ball.  \nMumpfield can high-point and shield the opponent.  \n\n \n141 \nPosition: Mumpfield can dig out low throws and embrace the fall. He can turn behind his break path on a vertical route, \nleaping behind and outside his path to get parallel with the ground and still snap his hands late to catch the ball with \noverhand position.  \nFocus: Mumpfield can take a hit to his chest as he catches a target at his waist. He can take hard shots to his chest and \nside over the middle from linebackers.  \nTransitions: He adheres to catch and pierce principles. He obeys the path of the ball to dictate the direction of his \ntransition.  \nElusiveness: Mumpfield has patient and sudden footwork he uses with routes. This won’t be hard for him to use as a \nrunner. He’ll drop his weight to decelerate in traffic with the hope of undercutting pursuit.  \nMumpfield has hard lateral cuts with range, but he’s not light-footed or explosive with them. He might make the first man \nmiss but the effort gives pursuit time to catch him. Whether it’s with lateral cuts  or other movement, Mumpfield usually \nmakes the first man miss after the catch.  \nHe only needs 1-2 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter path.  \nVision: Mumpfield is a decisive runner who navigates heavy traffic to hit open creases. He’ll try to press and cut back \nagainst unblocked defenders when working in the middle of the field. He’s not always sudden enough as a runner to do it, \nbut he’s patient and creative with and without blockers. He’s a decisive kick return specialist and manager of situations with \nthe ball in his hands on offense.  \nPower: Mumpfield can pull through reaches to his lower body. He keeps his pad level low. He can keep his feet moving to \ngenerate a push or pull a defender wrapped at his waist to fall forward. He’s not a pile mover. Once he’s wrapped, he’s \nessentially done. \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate direct shots from cornerbacks.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate glancing shots to his pads from cornerbacks.  \nBall Security: Mumpfield carries the ball high to his chest. He is prone to swinging the ball in open space and when initially \naccelerating. He will clap it tight with both hands in traffic and tighten up the elbow to his side.  \nBlocking: Mumpfield works inside to get a flat position against a Man Over Me defender. He turns quickly to earn a square \nposition with is hips and knees bent and shuffling his feet from a wide stance as he moves laterally. Mumpfield’s hands are \ntight enough to work inside the arms of the defender.  \nMumpfield earns a flat lead to cut off the safety on Most Dangerous Man blocks. He overextends when taking the air out the \ninteraction and this leads to Mumpfield losing position immediately after initial contact.  \nHe’ll work inside against linebackers but must square more to the inside. He sustains contact but gets driven back and the \nlack of refined positioning and punch limits the effectiveness of the effort.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Mumpfield will be a late-round selection, possibly available as first-call free agent after \nrookie drafts.

        "analysis": "Konata Mumpfield is a wide receiver prospect with a unique blend of strengths and weaknesses that make him a potential late-round NFL draft pick or priority free agent.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Route Running:**  Mumpfield possesses a sophisticated route tree, using a variety of releases (staggered stance, double up, read step, two-quick, feet switch, trigger step), stems, and breaks (long break step, flat drive and line steps, drop and pop, three-step break) to consistently create separation. He displays excellent pacing, deceleration, and body control, manipulating defenders with savvy timing and changes of speed.  His route running is considered his biggest asset, even compensating for his lack of elite speed.\n* **Excellent Ball Tracking and Catching:**  He shows impressive ability to track the ball over his shoulder, head, and even behind his frame.  He's capable of high-pointing the ball and shielding defenders.  While he occasionally uses underhand technique, especially on lower throws, he is effective at securing the catch, even while absorbing significant hits.\n* **High-Point Catching Ability:**  He demonstrates the ability to make contested catches, even leaping and adjusting to off-target throws.\n* **Above-Average After-the-Catch Potential:** Although not his greatest strength, he shows an ability to make defenders miss, utilizing patient and sudden footwork.  He's decisive in navigating traffic and finding open creases.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve After-the-Catch Ability:** While he can make defenders miss, his elusiveness and explosion after the catch are not on par with his route-running skills.  Improving his open-field running would significantly boost his overall value.\n* **Consistency in Catch Technique:** While generally a reliable catcher, he needs to improve his consistency with overhand catching technique, particularly when the ball is at his waist.  His underhand technique is prone to fumbles.\n* **Blocking:** Although he shows effort in blocking, he needs to refine his technique and positioning to become more effective.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Elite Speed/Explosion:** His 4.59 40-yard dash, while not slow, isn't in the top tier for NFL receivers. His lack of top-end speed limits his potential as a deep threat.\n* **Inconsistent Catch Technique (Underhand):**  His occasional reliance on underhand catching could lead to more drops in the NFL.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report lists a range of comparisons, highlighting his versatility:\n\n* **Brandon Lloyd:**  This comparison points to his excellent route-running and ability to create separation.\n* **Antonio Bryant:**  Suggests a similar talent level with potentially more refined skills.\n* **Dante Pettis:**  This could indicate a similar skill set with a ceiling closer to a role player.\n\nThe overall profile suggests Mumpfield projects as a solid rotational player, potentially a valuable late-round pick or undrafted free agent who could develop into a reliable receiver with further refinement of his catching technique and after-the-catch ability.  His route running skills are his strongest asset and provide a solid foundation for NFL success.  His overall athleticism may limit his ceiling, but his route-running prowess gives him a real shot.\n"

        "player_name": "Isaiah Neyor",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR21 \nJersey No.18 \nHeight/Weight: 6’4”/218 School: Nebraska/Texas/Wyoming \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Nico Collins – X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.2 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUTEP ‘24 \n• \nColorado ‘24 \n• \nIllinois ‘24 \n• \nOhio State ‘24 \n• \nUCLA ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: It’s very possible Neyor is one of the top 10-12 receivers in this class. If the ACL tear he suffered in \n2022 isn’t a problem—and it doesn’t appear to be—the grade change would tie Neyor with Tre Harris as WR14 with 84 \npoints.  \nNeyor earned targets in situations where he wasn’t forced to navigate traffic after the catch in ways that required patience, \ncreativity, or dynamic movement. I watched all of his tape – twice – and I couldn’t find scenarios where I could say that \ncould/couldn’t run with patience, creativity, or dynamic movement.  \n \nIn cases like these, I can’t give a player credit for doing something I haven’t seen. However, if I had to project what he can \ndo based on what I have seen, I’d bet Neyor’s elusiveness and vision would have earned him 1.5-2 points more than I gave \nhim in his evaluation.  \n \nI were I’d gamble on where I think his true value is, and if an NFL team selects the 6’4”, 220-pound Neyor in a range \ncommensurate with that value – the third round or early-fourth round – I’d be inclined to value Neyor as a top-10 receiver \nprospect in this class rather than WR21.  \n \nNeyor plays to his size and speed. His athletic ability, ball-winning, and vertical route-running skills remind me a lot of Nico \nCollins.  \n \nHe can play flanker or split end and there are justifications for him to work either position. If the offense matched to Neyor \nprefers explosive ball carriers in space at flanker, Neyor might not fit that requirement but he can be a boundary winner and \ndeep threat at split end.  \n \nIf the team’s split-end is more like Ja’Marr Chase or Justin Jefferson, Neyor could be the Tee Higgins-like complement with a \ngame that’s more like Collins.  \n \nThere are reasons to quell enthusiasm about Neyor as an unofficial top-10 value at a WR21 ranking. His timing routes need \nwork.  \n \nNeyor has good setups, but his breaks aren’t as precise and explosive with their deceleration as needed to win against good \ncover corners. Even if his breaks never become a strength of his game, Neyor has value against zone coverage and \nboundary routes against man-to-man that can translate to starter production.  \n \nVarious talkative scouts to the media have collective lamented the lack of a true split ends in this draft. Neyor is one of \nthem. It could make him a Day Two pick and vault his draft capital into early playing time.  \n \nReleases: Neyor has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest on his front \nknee uncrossed. When he begins his release, he sinks into his stance to get his pads over his knees and roll off the front \nfoot. When he doesn’t rock off his back foot before the sink, he releases without wasted motion.  \nNeyor reduces his shoulder from the hands of a defender with inside leverage. He attacks outside leverage at the line with a \nread step or violent stick and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe.  \nNeyor uses a double up that’s quick but without much range or pacing variation to steal a release and earn inside position \nas a blocker. He also uses it with inside foot to set up a diamond release with a swat-swim counter. \nHis hesitation and two-quick combination to steal a release has a patient but sudden dynamic. Too often, Neyer’s release \nare sudden but lack that contrast with patience to truly bait the opponent.  \n\n \n144 \nNeyor has a quick feet-switch and two-quick to set up an outside release against tight coverage at the line. He has a wipe \ncounter to a feet switch to get inside and stack. He also combines two quicks to steal a release and set up a fade during a \nrunning play.  \nNeyor uses a read step to get outside tight coverage at the line. He also uses it to steal a release and counters with a \ndouble swat. He combines a three-quick with a read step to set up off-coverage.  \nHe has a good throw by at the top of his stems. Neyor also has an effective shed against inside leverage.  \nSeparation: Neyor will stack a defender off an inside release on intermediate routes. He earns a step or two on tight \ncoverage on go routes and fades. His sturdy build helps him withstand contact during the stem and early break which often \nleads to the cornerback falling further behind. \nHe also stacks vertical routes early in the play.  \nRoute Stems: Neyor widens stems toward the high safety against Cover 2 to set up a route breaking outside-in against the \nzone corner. He dives inside against a corner playing inside leverage. His executes this stemming with a fast pace to set up \nthe rest of the route with a different pace.  \nNeyor will also run at the defender to set up an out-breaking route.  \nRoute Setups: Neyor will peek to the boundary after stacking a defender. He’ll peek outside against off-coverage over the \ntop to set up his dig route.  \nNeyor uses a stair step against tight coverage. When that coverage is outside-shade, Neyor will give an inset with an \nemphasized inside step at the top of his stem before breaking outside. He doesn’t turn the head or chest inside, but he \nturns the frame downhill after he was looking outside with a peek before the step and shift of his frame. \nNeyor also delivers the inset with a turn of the torso and head inside.  \nNeyor uses a hip shift at the top of stems of in-breaking routes against off coverage playing over him. He can get a \ndefender playing inside shade to turn his hips during the hip shift.  \nRoute Breaks: Neyor must run at full speed through his breaks on vertical routes and not anticipate that he’s not targeted. \nHe has lost a chance at easier targets because of this.  \nNeyor has a three-step break. He has reps where he doesn’t drop his weight and the break lacks explosive deceleration. He \nhas reps where he drops the weight, but the stem could be faster to set up sudden deceleration. \nHe has a false acceleration break working outside-in with weight drop but the speed of the stem and the deceleration in and \nout of the break aren’t explosive enough. There’s no artistry with pacing, either.  \nHe has weight drop with his drop-and-pop break.  \nNeyor gets his head around to the quarterback early in his break. He works back to the quarterback on curls and there is a \nflat drive and line step out of a three-step break.  \nHe has lapses with breaks that drift a step on speed turns due to the drive step.  \nHe plays with pace the out-and-up, going three-quarters speed with the out and then full speed when turning to the up.  \nZone Routes: Neyor identifies the second level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across zone coverage. He \ndoesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. \nHe also settles into the open space. If he doesn’t earn a target, he slides into an open passing lane to create for his \nquarterback. He has a feel for the zone triangle where he’s working.  \nRoute Boundary: Neyor is conscientious about owning the boundary on fade routes, so he gives the quarterback space \nbetween the numbers and the boundary to place the ball. This allows Neyor to fade late to the boundary or make a late \nback-shoulder turn.  \n\n \n145 \nNeyor can take a wrap at the back while tracking the ball away from his frame and over his shoulder with his back to the \ntarget and still tap and drag his feet inbounds.  \nNeyor can take a hit near the boundary and toe-tap or fall on one knee to remain in the field of play. He’ll also extend his \nframe for the ball and drag his feet to remain inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: Neyor doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily to attack targets with height. He uses overhand attack \neffectively. He tracks the ball over his shoulder with coverage tight to his back hip.  \nNeyor uses late hands with targets against tight coverage arriving over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: His hands can be too far apart when tracking over his shoulder on a full-extension grab of a vertical \nroute. He high-points and attacks at the earliest window. He does the same with targets wide of his frame on crossing \nroutes.  \nHe allows targets into his chest on crossing routes. He’s prone to using underhand position at chest-height and at his back \nshoulder.  \nThis has led to him juggling/fighting to secure the ball instead of a clean catch when he could have attack the ball at its \nearliest point. He does the same with some jump up and through or back-shoulder targets where overhand attack would be \noptimal. He has shown that he can win with overhand position, repeatedly.  \nOne crossing routes away from his frame, he can use overhand position at the earliest point with full extension of his arms. \nHe can struggle to bring the ball into his frame as cleanly as he should.  \nHe can clap-attack on back-shoulder targets. He’s successful but it’s still an added risk for drops.  \nPosition: Neyor can turn back-shoulder and extend his arms to the ball. He can jump up and through to stretch wide and \nhigh with overhand attack to initially earn the ball around the helmet of a defender while airborne. With better pass \nplacement, Neyer can execute a pull-back.  \nNeyor embraces the fall when attacking a target away from his frame with full extension toward the boundary. He must \nwork on embracing the fall after a full-extension high-point with coverage his face on a back-shoulder play. He can pull the \nball back but he must make the turn so he doesn’t finish his rotation facing the ground and jarring the ball loose.  \nFocus: Neyor extends wide of his break path with overhand attack at beltline and secures the ball as he turns into a \nlinebacker hitting him in the chest. He can bounce off a safety’s glancing shot to his side as he tracks the ball over his \nshoulder. \nNeyor can take a massive shot to the chest from a middle linebacker as he breaks inside on a zone route. He can also take \nhard hits to his back.  \nTransitions: Neyor can overthink the direction of his transitions rather than obeying the position of the ball. He has turned \ninto hits that he could have mitigated or avoided altogether.  \nElusiveness: Neyor has a tight spin that he can use in succession with other footwork. He gets his feet high enough to \nwork over low shots. He tries to spin through contact to work through it. He has some curvilinear bend and speed to work \ninside a force player on a run to the far-side flat.  \nNeyor doesn’t use many lateral cuts.  \nVision: Neyor runs to open space and has good feel for avoiding unplanned obstacles. When taking a designed run to the \nfar-side perimeter, Neyor is patient with setting up blocks so he can bait a linebacker or safety to shoot an interior gap so \nhe can bounce the play. He anticipates coverage over the top so he can cut inside it as soon as he makes the catch.  \nPower: Neyor’s stiff arm is effective when meeting hits from safeties crossing the field. He pulls through wraps to his lower \nlegs, and he has an effective balance-touch to maintain his stride after the tackle attempt.  \nDirect Contact Balance: I didn’t see direct hits despite watching multiple years of tape. Defenders were usually in his \nrearview mirror. \n\n \n146 \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a safety’s glancing shot to his side as he tracks the ball over his shoulder. \nNeyor can nearly maintain his footing from a hard hit to his side from a linebacker—he staggers as he spins off it but can \nregain his bearings. \nBall Security: Neyor tucks the ball high to his chest. The elbow is loose from his side. He can take hard hits to his ball-\ncarrying arm. He carries the ball to his boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Neyor earns assignments as a lead blocker motioning across the formation like an H-Back. He works tight to the \nline and narrows the gap between himself and his tackle or tight end’s outside shoulder so he can help double-team a \nlinebacker or safety in the force role. His spacing limits the potential for the defender to split the double team.  \nNeyor eliminates space between himself and the assignment, attacks the outside pad of the force defender and drives the \ndefender off his spot with good footwork and body position.  \nHe has delivered successful reps where he has pulled to the defensive end, earned square position, and punched the \ndefender to stand up the defender to seal a crease behind him. He could roll through the hips when he punches. \nNeyor uses his hands well in terms of placement. He can throw an uppercut with Man Over me blocks, but he’s not close \nenough to the defender with these assignments to roll through his hips to generate power.  \nWhen Neyor earns good position with his hands on a cornerback, he has a strong enough grip to sustain contact.  \nNeyor transitions quickly from route runner to blocker and can tilt into the defender to seal him from the ball carrier.  \nDurability: Neyor missed his with an ACL Tear in the preseason of 2022 at Texas. In 2021, he played for Wyoming as a \nfreshman and dealt with a preseason ankle injury that limited him to running and rehab in August. He started Week 1.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Before the NFL determines Neyor’s draft capital, I’d consider him at the end of the third \nround or early in the fourth round if there aren’t running backs with equally compelling grades. After the NFL Draft, I’m \nwilling to let draft capital sway me higher.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nRead Step, Wipe, Stack, Peek, High-Point \n• \nFeet-Switch, Two-Quick, Separation, Tracking vs. Contact, Stiff-Arm, Balance Touch \n• \nSettles in Zone, Adjusts to Open Window, Maintains Friendly Position, Early Attack \n• \nThrow By, Snaps Break, Transition, Spin \n• \nIsaiah Neyor Full 2024 Highlights \n• \nIsaiah Neyor 2021-2022 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n147",
        "analysis": "Isaiah Neyor:  A Deep Threat X-Receiver with Upside\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Athleticism:** Neyor's 6'4\", 218-pound frame combined with impressive speed makes him a natural deep threat. His athletic ability and ball-winning skills are reminiscent of Nico Collins.  He excels at high-pointing the ball and winning jump balls.\n* **Boundary Receiver:** He's a strong boundary receiver, effective at winning against man coverage on fade routes and other boundary throws.  He possesses excellent body control and awareness to stay inbounds.\n* **Zone Route Running:**  Neyor displays a good understanding of zone coverages, showing patience and the ability to find open spaces, creating opportunities for his quarterback.\n* **Blocking Ability:**  Neyor is a willing and effective blocker, showing the potential to contribute in this phase of the game, even leading blocks in motion.\n* **Durability Concerns Seem Mitigated:** While he suffered a significant ACL tear in 2022, the scouting report suggests his recovery appears to be complete, limiting this significant concern.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** While he displays the ability to win vertically and on boundary plays, his route precision and explosiveness in breaks need improvement.  Faster stems and more decisive breaks could significantly elevate his game.\n* **Consistency in Catching:** Although he displays good high-pointing ability, he occasionally struggles with securing catches, particularly when using an underhand approach instead of an overhand technique.\n* **NFL Scheme Fit:**  Neyor's skillset might not be ideal for offenses that rely heavily on explosive plays in space. He is best suited for roles that utilize his size and deep threat capabilities.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Primary:** Nico Collins (Texans WR) – This is the most prominent comparison, highlighting his size, speed, and ability as a boundary receiver.\n* **Secondary (Complementary Role):** Tee Higgins (Bengals WR) – If paired with a high-volume No. 1 receiver like Ja'Marr Chase or Justin Jefferson, Neyor's skillset could allow him to flourish in a similar role to Higgins.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nNeyor is a high-upside receiver prospect whose size, athleticism, and boundary skills make him a compelling Day 2 pick.  While his route running needs refinement, his strengths could allow him to become a starting-caliber NFL receiver if he can reach his full potential. The ACL tear is a factor to consider, but the report suggests it is no longer a major impediment.  His potential makes him a valuable target in the later rounds of the draft.\n"

The easier \nfactor to debunk is that Johnson is too slow for his size.  \n \nJohnson is a slot receiver. Most NFL slot receivers aren’t used as deep threats. Most slot receivers require acceleration and \nshort-area burst. Johnson’s numbers in those areas were elite for any receiver. It’s a non-issue.  \n \n\n \n148 \nSize may matter. While the 154-pound Johnson is no Soupy Shapiro, who played for the Staten Island Stapletons in 1929 at \n119 pounds, Johnson is 11 pounds lighter than Nate Dell, who is likely another year away from seeing an NFL field after \ndislocating his knee and tearing the ACL.  \n \nDell’s injury history a includes a fractured fibula and tears to his MCL, LCL, and meniscus. While the list of light receivers \nwho have been productive in the NFL is growing, that list is mostly filled with players weighing between 170-180 pounds. \nJohnson is 16 pounds lighter than that minimum range.  \n \nDell’s a better aerial artist at the boundary than Johnson and earns usage outside. Players who earn contested targets \ntorque their frames in odd shapes to earn the ball and remain inbounds with another body tangled with them.  \n \nJohnson isn’t that style of player. He’s strictly and open-space player. While at risk for taking hard hits over the middle, he \nhas taken shots at Oregon that the NFL’s Commissioner office would have fined the defender a down payment for a \nmortgage.  \n \nWhile the thought of a middle linebacker squishing Johnson like a cicada hitting a windshield of tractor-trailer on a Florida \nhighway will scare off many NFL teams and depress his draft capital with others, let’s look back at a player who played a \ndifficult role in one of the most dangerous parts of the game during its most vicious era.  \n \nAlex, “Who is Gerald McNeil?”  \n \nKnown as “Ice Cube,” McNeil earned a Pro Bowl bid as a return specialist in 1987 with 728 return yards and 2 touchdowns, \nhandling both kick offs and punts for the Cleveland Browns.  \n \nFunny enough McNeil’s rookie year was much better seasons – earning a combined 1,366 yards on 87 total returns. He was \nthree yards short of 1,000 yards as a kick returner that year.  \n \nMcNeil played five years in the NFL and only missed four games – all in the same season…his Pro Bowl season. Ice Cube \naveraged 897 yards per season and had four seasons with at least 700 return yards.  \n \nMcNeil’s listed height and weight on Pro Football Reference? 5’7”, 145 pounds. It’s reported he likely played at a weight \nabove 150 pounds. He was a second-round pick in the 1984 supplemental draft.  \n \nReturning punts and kickoffs in the 1980s and 90s was much different than working the middle of the field on offense in \n2024 – it was far more dangerous. Pass defenders rarely get more than a runway of 15-20 yards into a hit. Kick coverage \nearned double that runway with a lot more reps.  \n \nIn today’s spread-out NFL with lighter defenders and emphasis on player safety, I’m open to the idea that Johnson’s weight \nwon’t be the problem the media is making it. I’m also open to the idea that players will have difficulty getting the kind of hit \non Johnson that will debilitate him.  \n \nThere’s also likelihood that the odds of a life-debilitating hit happening to a player, regardless of size, is smaller than the \ngravity of the concerns about Johnson. Of course, there’s a non-zero chance for every player who steps onto a field that it \ncould happen.  \n \nHowever, when I think of Ice Cube McNeil’s career, it’s difficult for me to be as concerned as others.  \n \nJohnson has sudden and artful releases from the line of scrimmage, he’s sets up his breaks like a pro, he snaps off breaks \nwith suddenness, and he works back to the quarterback. He excels at working with his quarterback on scramble drills as \nwell as finding open space against zone coverage on time for his quarterback to get the ball out early in a play.  \n \nMy biggest concern about Johnson as a receiver is his hands. He makes plays that could earn him an invitation in the RSP’s \nfuture Brandon Lloyd Aerial Artistry Invitational, but he has lapses where his hands get too wide as he begins his attack.  \n \nThis leads to clap-attacks, fighting the ball, and drops. Johnson had a game against UCLA where he dropped the ball four \ntime. Although he caught a touchdown late in the game, he trapped the ball because he lost confidence in his technique.  \n \nBad weeks happen. It’s also possible Johnson was fighting through an injury that led to difficulties with his attack of the \nfootball. These are things an NFL scout or player-personnel group investigates pre-draft.  \n \n\n \n149 \nWhat I can tell you is that Johnson didn’t have another meltdown with his hands like that. Still, at his size, Johnson must \ntighten up his attack to reduce any potential for fighting the ball in the middle of the field. That’s Turnover Territory when a \nreceiver tips a pass or allows one between his hands.  \n \nThere’s no need to wax poetic about Johnson’s work after the catch. It’s what he does best and why he can be a factor for \nany team that’s seeking a big-play option who can get into open space with RPOs, screens, crossing routes, over routes, \ncorner routes, and even simple hitches and stop routes.  \n \nOf course, what I think of Johnson’s weight doesn’t matter if the NFL decides that regardless of Ice Cube’s success, Johnson \nisn’t big enough to ride the pro football rollercoaster. If they draft him inside the sixth round, consider it a tacit stamp of \napproval and we’ll see Johnson compete for legitimate opportunities.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? He’s used in the slot, out of the backfield, and on the wing. He functions as a Joker or H-\nBack type of player without the blocking element.  \nFun Fact: Johnson is the adopted brother of Bo and Caleb Nix. \nReleases: Johnson has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands hang at either \nside of his front knee.   \nJohnson sinks into his stance when he begins his release. He rolls off his front foot without his back foot wasting motion. His \ngait has a long sprinter’s stride and full arm pumping.  \nJohnson uses a wipe counter to a defender’s hands at the top of a stem. He also has a quick shed in the same situation. He \nuses a hip-shift with a wipe counter effectively against off-coverage or when he’s in the slot or off the line against a \ndefender playing tight. He’ll also use a stutter against off-coverage.  \nJohnson’s hip-shift is one of his artful release maneuvers. He has a good stick to set up a wipe.  \nJohnson combines a two-quick and double-up and then counters with a wipe against off-coverage. He displays some \npatience and suddenness when performing it on your own.  \nJohnson has a capable one-step-stretch/read-step to attack outside leverage. He also combines the read step with a two-\nquick or a shed counter. He also uses a read step, two-quick, and wipe counter as a good combo on the slant or skinny \npost. He uses a hesi and a stick or a hesi and a double up to steal a release and uses it with patience and suddenness. \nJohnson also delivers a nice trigger step to steal a release and set up his blocks. \nSeparation: Johnson has the speed to sustain separation deep. He can stack a defender early in a route as well as late in a \nroute, He must do it more often when he earns separation.  \nRoute Stems: Johnson widens stems against defensive backs playing outside shade to attack their leverage. He’ll also dive \ninside.  \nRoute Setups: Johnson will attack the defender’s back late in the stem when the defender is playing off-coverage—even if \nit’s just a stick inside.  \nJohnson uses a hip-shift to set up off-coverage mid-stem/late-stem on vertical routes. He’ll also use a stick with a head fake \nand then counter the defender’s hands with a wipe.  \nJohnson also slows his stem against off-coverage to set up a sudden two-quick. There’s a patient and sudden quality to the \nset up.  \nOn over routes, Johnson has a nice inset at the top of his stem to freeze or move off-coverage.  \nJohnson can stair-step on vertical routes by widening the stem initially and then straightening out the stem to run at the \ndefender. He’ll get the defender to turn his hips straight or back inside and then deliver the double-swat counter to the \ndefender’s hands to get back to the outside.  \nHe has a capable peek to sell the potential fade at the top of stems.  \n\n \n150 \nRoute Breaks: Johnson has a quick three-step break with effective weight-drop. He also slides away from coverage after \nthe break while maintaining a friendly target position to the quarterback.  \nJohnson has a long break step into a weight-drop. He also snaps the turn.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Johnson works 1-2 times in succession to find an open zone and he’ll tempo his \nbreak to maintain a friendly target.  \nJohnson drifts out of breaks – short and intermediate speed breaks – the line step isn’t flat enough. His shallow speed outs \nhave a sharper line step more often.  \nZone Routes: Johnson identifies second-level defenders, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He also presents a \nfriendly targets and slowly shuffles to an open passing lane as needed.  \nWhen the first break doesn’t earn a target, Johnson finds the open zone.  \nRoute Boundary: Johnson is aware of the boundary and will toe-tap on a high-point, back-shoulder, or out to remain in \nbounds. He can earn the ball and the boundary with coverage tight on the back-shoulder route. \nPass Tracking: Johnson tracks targets over his shoulder in the vertical game. He doesn’t leave his feet when targets are at \nhelmet level.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Johnson attacks targets at his beltline with underhand position away from his frame. He can turn \nbehind his break path and attack with overhand position while breaking in the opposite direction. He attacks the ball with \nthe appropriate position based on the trajectory of the ball but must refine the execution. \nJohnson can clap-attack targets away from his frame because his hands are a little too wide and it can lead to him losing \nthe target as he retracts it to his frame. Even when he catches the ball in these scenarios, he often catches the ball midway \nthrough or the back end of the ball.  \nJohnson will also attack targets at the earliest point of arrival when the ball is arriving toward the numbers of his jersey. \nHowever, against UCLA, Johnson had multiple clap-attack drops that by the fourth quarter, he caught a TD on an over route \nat chest height with underhand position because he lost confidence in his technique.  \nJohnson has the hand-eye coordination to win difficult one-handed grabs of targets high and away from his frame on wide \nroutes that force him to turn away from his break path. He had made these multiple times and they are borderline Brandon \nLloyd-esque.  \nPosition: Johnson executes a pull-back effectively against tight coverage on seam routes. He’ll also follow it with a good \nembracing of the fall to avoid landing on the target.  \nFocus: Johnson can pull the ball away from a defender tight to his back up the seam and execute the pull-back to protect \nthe target.  \nTransitions: Johnson has effective catch-and-pierce technique. He understands where the nearest defenders are on the \nfield as he runs his routes so he knows where the open space will be. Johnson also obeys the ball at its target trajectory to \ndetermine his path.  \nElusiveness: Johnson can break across the field on a crosser at full speed and decelerate to a complete stop within two \nsteps. He drops his weight well to do it.  \nJohnson will also spin through contact. His spins in open space are deliberate and loose rather than tight. He has good \ncurvilinear movement and stop-stop movement to make multiple defenders in open space. Johnson opens his hips \neffectively to make 90-degree turns.  \nHe only needs 1-2 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach. He can duck under defenders and deliver multiple \ncuts in succession to avoid unblocked defenders in the open field.  \nVision: Johnson has the peripheral vision to address backside pursuit. He has a good feel for where the open space is. He’ll \nsell out his body or dive under defenders to reach the sticks based on down and distance needs. He’ll also split defenders \nwhen necessary.  \n\n \n151 \nJohnson is patient with setting up multiple defenders in the open field when working across the field. He can press inside \nand then bounce the play outside once he manipulates the pursuit.  \nHe is decisive with following blocks and creates space when there are none.  \nPower: Johnson has an accurate stiff-arm that allows him to use it as a throw-by against backside pursuit. He pulls through \nreaches.  \nJohnson finishes plays with his pads low. He will split defenders and keep his feet moving. He’ll take on a defender with his \npads to earn that final yardage at the marker or pylon.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Johnson can knock a safety on his butt when he has momentum downhill and the safety is flat-\nfooted.  \nBall Security: Johnson tucks the ball under his left arm and high to his chest. He’s prone to using the left arm regardless of \nthe side of the field, but he has shown (UCLA) that he can tuck the ball to his boundary-side arm when it’s the right side of \nthe field.  \nJohnson’s elbow is loose and the ball can squirt free from strikes and rakes. When hit square on the ball, he can maintain \npossession.   \nBlocking: Johnson breaks down too late when attempting to square a defensive back in the open field. It leads to him \noverrunning the assignment. He is also prone to overextending with Man Over Me assignments. He can be patient with \napproaching defenders on Man Over Me Assignments. When he is patient, he doesn’t overextend. \nWhen he can deliver his shoulder or elbow, Johnson can close the gap and deliver a hard strike. This works more often \nagainst defensive backs but if they see him coming, the defender can avoid the contact altogether because of the \noverextension. Johnson’s approach and attack needs significant correction on multiple fronts.  \nWhen Johnson reaches a defender with his hands tight, he can work into the chest and keep his feet moving to drive the \ndefender away from the ball.  \nJohnson will attack Most Dangerous Man Assignments, but he must take a flatter path to cut off the defender. He does a \ngood job attacking the force defender and cutting him off, including linebackers.  \nDurability: Shoulder injury against Maryland in 2024 and returned to face Washington a few weeks later.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If return yardage is a part of your league’s scoring system, consider Johnson in rookie \ndrafts before the NFL makes its picks. If you want to make sure the NFL is going to let Johnson compete before you \nconsider him in the second half of your rookie drafts, wait to see if he earns draft capital.   \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nHard Break, Friendly Target, Knowledge of Field, Transition \n• \nTwo-Quick, Double-Up, Wipe, Works Open on Second Break, Tempo, Target-Friendly \n• \nStick, Head Fake, Pull-Back, Embrace Fall, Tight Coverage \n• \nWhere He Clap-attacks and Fights the Ball \n• \nClap-attack and Catches, but Fights It \n• \nRead-step, Fights Through Contact, Adjusts, but Clap-attacks and Drops \n• \nStair-step \n• \nIntelligent Zone Adjustment, Early Catch, Press and Bounce, and Strong Finish \n• \nWidens Stem, Straightens Out to Bait Off-Coverage, Double-Swipe Outside, and TD \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n152",
        "analysis": "Tez Johnson is a slot receiver prospect with elite acceleration and short-area burst, despite his smaller size (5'9\", 154 lbs).  His game is built on creating separation in open space and making plays after the catch.  He excels at running various routes (RPOs, screens, crossing routes, etc.), displaying artful releases and precise route running.  His ability to work with quarterbacks on scramble drills and find open zones against zone coverage are notable strengths.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elite acceleration and short-area burst:**  A key asset for a slot receiver.\n* **Artful route running:**  Excellent releases, precise breaks, and savvy adjustments to leverage.\n* **After-the-catch ability:**  Makes significant plays in open space.\n* **Zone awareness:**  Finds open areas in zone coverages consistently.\n* **Scramble drill proficiency:**  Works well with quarterbacks on broken plays.\n* **High-point ability (at times):** Showcases potential for contested catches, though inconsistent.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve hand technique:**  Prone to drops due to inconsistent hand placement and \"clap-attacks.\"  Needs to refine his ball-tracking and securing techniques.\n* **Increase size and strength:**  His small frame is a major concern for NFL teams. While he shows some ability to take hits, consistent success at this level requires physical development.\n* **Consistency:** Though he had a game with multiple drops, it appears to be an isolated incident rather than a consistent pattern; however, consistent high-level play needs to be shown.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares him to Tank Dell and Tutu Atwell, both undersized receivers known for their speed and agility.  However, a more compelling comparison might be Gerald McNeil, a 5'7\", 145-pound Pro Bowl return specialist in the 1980s, highlighting that smaller, explosive players can find success in the NFL.  While the physical demands are different, it suggests that Johnson's size might not be the insurmountable barrier some assume.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nJohnson possesses significant talent and skill, but his size is a significant question mark. His success in the NFL depends heavily on refining his hand technique and proving his durability against the physicality of the professional game.  If he can address these weaknesses, he has the potential to be a valuable slot receiver, similar to Dell or Atwell, but with perhaps a slightly different skillset.  His upside is high, but his floor is also low, making him a high-risk, high-reward prospect.\n"

It’s a fitting description for Dike’s overall game. A physical speedster with good skills \nafter the catch, Dike also wins the ball effectively downfield and against tight coverage.  \n \nAt this stage of his game, Dike can use more subtlety with setting up defenders as a route runner. Every move is at full \nspeed when certain tasks are best with a change of pace. Still, Dike can become a first-year asset in the right situation. \n \n\n \n153 \nDike can contribute immediately as a flanker tasked with RPOs, screens, crossers, outlet passes, and intermediate and deep \nroutes that break across the width of the field. Get him the ball in open field, and Dike will work around you, over you, and \nin some cases, drag you along for a ride to the sticks.  \n \nDike is also productive with contested targets. He has the timing necessary to generate good position with attacks requiring \na jump up and through. Few young receivers do this well and Dike is one of them.  \n \nOther than an isolated issue with the attack he uses based on the trajectory of the ball, Dike has reliable hands with targets \naway from his frame, against tight coverage, and versus contact. He’s not an aerial artist if you’re looking for acrobatics, \nbut if the ball is near his frame, he wins a lot more than he loses.  \n \nDike is an asset as a blocker. He earns good position for crack blocks, and other efforts near the line of scrimmage. This \nskillset alone will tip the scales for him to see the field in three-receiver sets.  \n \nIf Dike becomes more aware of how to vary pacing in aspects of receiver play that require it, he could become a good NFL \nstarter. Dike’s current skills as a pass-catcher, ball carrier, and special teams make it worthwhile to see if he makes it a \nreality.  \n \nReleases: Dike has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest at the sides of \nhis front knee. He releases off the line with his pads over his knees and his head up. He rolls off the front foot. He’s prone to \nrocking off the back foot before rolling off the front foot.  \nDike sinks into his stance after rocking off the back foot. It would be best if he sinks into his stance without the rocking and \nroll off the front foot. His arms move at about half their range as he sprints off the line.  \nDike uses a feet switch to release inside but he must execute the movement faster and deliver it with a greater range of \nmotion. He’ll reduce his shoulder to counter the hands of a defender. He has a shed that needs more violence with the \nmovement against inside leverage.  \nDike has a double up to set up an outside release against inside leverage. He uses a stick to the inside to draw outside \nleverage inside and then dip around them to the outside.  \nDike’s blade release – shoulder reduction and shed combo – has violence against outside leverage playing off-coverage.  \nHe has a capable two-quick with a swat-swim counter to win the slant.  \nDike will steal a release with a read step. Dike’s moves are sudden and violent, but he must learn to develop the artistry of \npatience to incorporate into the moves so he can bait coverage.  \nSeparation: Dike has enough acceleration to beat a corner playing off-man up the boundary and gain 1-2 steps during the \nfirst 10-15 yards off the line. He can outflank a high safety to the near-side boundary and flip the field.  \nHe can stack within the first 10-15 yards when playing outside. The routes at Wisconsin were more conducive for stacking \nthan at Florida where many of the verticals are deep overs crossers and double moves.  \nRoute Stems: Dike stems inside against inside leverage. He widens stems against outside leverage. Dike will prolong the \nstem directly at the high safety to set up the deep over.  \nRoute Setups: After stemming inside against off-coverage with inside leverage, Dike will deliver an inset with a head fake \nto set up his break outside. When setting up a break across the middle, Dike will give a nod to the boundary at the top of \nhis stem.  \nDike can stair-step off a dive inside and add a peek at the top of the stem against off-coverage to set up a break inside.  \nRoute Breaks: Dike has a long break step into a drop and pop break that has weight drop. He must cultivate some snap \nwith the turn.   \nDike has a long break step into a three-step break on the intermediate curl. He drops his weight into the hard break and \ncreates a friendly target for the quarterback. The weight drop is about half of the range it should be for sudden deceleration.  \nDike has flat drive and line steps on dig routes and speed outs. He snaps the turn well on the speed out.  \n\n \n154 \nZone Routes: Dike identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and works across the open zone. He must wait to \nshow his eyes to the quarterback until he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender. He shows his eyes too early with routes \nwhere he’s breaking just above the defender.  \nDike must also work on where to settle after executing a tempo-break across a zone so he doesn’t break next to a defender \nhe could have avoided.  \nDike is better about waiting to show his eyes on over routes where there’s more distance between himself and the second-\nlevel defender at the break point.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target in zone coverage, Dike will work with his quarterback on the scramble drill to find \nan open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Dike is aware of the boundary and taps one foot inbounds in situations where he could have attacked the \nball earlier and gotten both feet inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: Dike tracks the ball over his shoulder. He can use overhand and underhand attack. He can also win one-\nhanded on shallow routes over the shoulder with underhand attack.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Dike catches targets at his waist with underhand position. There is some clap-trapping with the \nattack.  \nDike can turn his torso to his back hip and catch the ball with underhand attack as he’s breaking in the opposite direction. \nHe can also attack wide of his frame with underhand position \nDike uses underhand position tight to his frame for targets where he could attack at the earliest window with overhand \nposition.  \nWhen the ball arrives above his numbers, Dike uses overhand attack and catches the ball about a foot from his frame. Dike \ncan high-point.  \nPosition: After high-pointing, Dike can embrace the fall through contact. After tracking over his shoulder against tight trail \ncoverage, Dike executes a quick pull back.  \nDike can perform jump up and through positioning with a proper highpoint and retraction against tight coverage on a deep \nover route.  \nFocus: Dike can high-point with a defender on his back in tight coverage. He can break over the middle, catch the ball on \nhis numbers and transition downhill into a hard hit to his chest. He can dig out low throws with sliding catches after taking a \nshot to his side.  \nTransitions: Dike makes smooth catch and pierce transitions downhill when he’s breaking across the field on a route. He \nobeys the ball to determine which way he transitions.  \nElusiveness: Dike spins off contact to at least lean forward through tackle attempts. He can change stride length and set \nup a jump cut over a low shot. He times leaps over low shots effectively.  \nDike can cut and bend around pursuit over the top in the open field. Dike flips his hips well enough off a stutter to get \noutside pursuit over the top in the open field.  \nHe can transition within inches of the boundary downhill from a break toward the sideline and do it without a transition step.  \nVision: Dike works to open space, but also understands his blocking scheme and when to duck behind them so he can allow \nthe blocks to set up. He makes good decisions to get downhill and split unblocked defenders rather than trying outflank \nthem. He takes down-and-distance and other game-script factors into account as a decision-maker.  \nPower: Dike has a stiff arm but must be more intentional with placement. Otherwise, it’s a limp noodle flailing from his \nshoulder in the open field. When he lands the stiff arm with an early and firm attack, he can ward off pursuit reaching for \nhis frame. \nWhen he has momentum downhill, he’ll carry a corner on his back for 3-5 yards. He pulls through reaches and wraps to his \nframe as he transitions downhill.  \n\n \n155 \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Dike bounces off a safety’s hit to his thighs when both players have momentum into the \ncollision. He has a tight spin and can bounce off a glancing shot, maintaining footing with a balance-touch. He can bounce \noff glancing shots from off-ball linebackers in the middle of the field.  \nBall Security: Dike tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm after the catch. He can take contact to his ball-carrying arm \nand maintain possession of the ball when the defender yanks at his arm.  \nDike carries the ball high to his chest, but loose at the elbow. When backside pursuit chops, Dike has lost the ball.  \nBlocking: Dike works inside in an attempt to earn a flat lead on Most Dangerous Man assignments, but he doesn’t get far \nenough inside to earn that position. When he’s patient and allows the defender to meet him halfway, he earns a square and \nsquat position, eliminates the air between them, and delivers his hands with elbows bent.  \nDike strikes with good position on the force defender’s inside shoulder and moves his feet to turn the defender to the \nboundary on a perimeter play. He also earns the outside shoulder on linebackers and seals them inside with good position \nwith his stance and hands.  \nWhen stalk blocking, Dike can overextend at the strike point, leading with his head to take the air out of the interaction \nbetween him and the defender. When he does this, he gets his hands tight into the chest of the opponent, but the \noverextension can make it difficult to sustain position beyond the initial contact.  \nDike keeps his feet moving after making contact and works to maintain contact. When Dike delivers an uppercut strike with \ntight hands from a square position, he’s tough for a defensive back to beat.  \nDike handles edge defenders when tight to the formation – linebackers and defensive ends. He attacks the inside shoulder, \nfans outside with a wide stance to ride the defender around the backfield with good leg drive and hand position into the \nchest to give the back space to reach the line of scrimmage.  \nDike doesn’t get this kind of push against defensive ends, but he takes the correct shoulder and shields the backside \ndefender effectively for a brief enough moment. With linebackers, Dike can handle some front-side action with the fan-out.  \nDike will run off a defender, tilt into them as he transitions from route runner to blocker, and continuously close with his \nfeet moving and gaining position until the whistle.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Dike’s pre-NFL Draft value may be higher than his RSP ranking, but if you can get him in \nthe second half of the third round, I’d give it consideration. Make sure you’re looking at the running backs still available.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLate Attack, Over the Shoulder, Boundary Awareness, Late Execution \n• \nRelease and Weight Drop Need Refining, Obeys the Ball \n• \nStair-Step and Peek \n• \nProlonged Peek to Fade then Post for TD \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n156",
        "analysis": "Chimere Dike is a WR prospect with a high ceiling but needing refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Speed and Physicality:** Dike possesses exceptional speed and physicality, allowing him to win contested catches and break tackles. He's described as \"all gas, no brakes.\"  He excels at deep routes and routes that cross the field.\n* **Contested Catch Ability:** He shows excellent timing and positioning to win jump balls and targets in tight coverage. This is a skill many young receivers lack.\n* **After the Catch Ability:**  Dike is a strong runner after the catch, able to elude tackles and gain extra yards.\n* **Blocking:** He's a surprisingly effective blocker, contributing in both run and pass situations. This will help him see the field early.\n* **Reliable Hands (with caveats):** His hands are generally reliable when the ball is near his frame, even in tight coverage.  However, he needs to improve his ball tracking on throws outside his frame.\n* **High-pointing the ball:** Shows strong ability to high point the football, making contested catches a regular occurrence.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** His route running needs significant improvement. He often attacks at full speed, lacking subtlety and changes of pace to set up defenders.  Improving this will drastically increase his effectiveness.\n* **Ball Tracking:** While generally reliable when close to his body, he needs to improve his ability to track the ball further outside his frame.\n* **Stiff Arm Consistency:** His stiff arm is inconsistent. Developing consistent placement would make him even more difficult to tackle.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparisons are CeeDee Lamb, Santonio Holmes, and an unnamed \"X\" receiver. This spectrum highlights his potential for being a versatile receiver with both deep threat and possession receiver qualities, but also a potential for inconsistency similar to Holmes' career. The \"X\" likely represents a potential for a very high-end outcome, if he refines his weaknesses.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nDike is a high-upside receiver prospect who could become a valuable contributor in the NFL. His physical tools and competitive nature are undeniable. However, the need for significant improvement in his route running and ball tracking could determine whether he reaches his full potential.  He projects as a rotational starter who could become a full-time starter with coaching and refinement.  His blocking ability should give him a chance to see the field early.\n"

At the same \ntime, the RSP’s Depth of Talent Score – the true reflection of the player’s evaluation – will not be as far apart from the \nteam’s expectations.  \n \nAyomanor falls into this glut of prospects who have a lot of tools, but work is needed to apply them as an NFL starter. Mind \nyou, this is in a league where there are a lot of players who fit this description at the wide receiver position.   \n \n\n \n157 \nStill, Ayomanor is this low on my board because he has a lot of skills that set the table for good plays, but flaws and lapse \nthat derail the outcome. From releases through the catch point, Ayomanor’s game feels like he’s player who, too often, \ntakes three good steps forward and one giant leap backward.  \n \nLet’s start with his release packages. Ayomanor has a strong array of footwork and hand counters to defeat coverage at the \nlie of scrimmage or at the top of his stems. Best yet, he delivers most of these moves with the desired contrast between \npatience and suddenness so he can properly bait defenders.  \n \nHowever, Ayomanor either isn’t getting up to top speed quickly enough or he doesn’t maintain that speed long enough. \nAlthough he can flip the field, earning a couple of steps on cornerbacks early in routes, safeties chase down Ayomanor in \nscenarios where one would expect him to pull away.  \n \nAyomanor gets early separation but fails to stack his opponents and allows them back into the play when the ball arrives. \nIt’s as if he’s self-sabotaging.  \n \nThis is also true with the final half of his work. Ayomanor has effective setups and breaks with timing routes, but has \nlackluster execution at the catch point. Ayomanor clap-attacks targets too often. He doesn’t attack the ball early enough to \nprevent defenders from making plays on the ball, and he doesn’t generate position to prevent it from happening.  \n \nAyomanor’s game also short-circuits against tight coverage. It’s as if he forgets which type of attack is best for the \ntrajectory of the ball when a defender is playing him tight.  \n \nAyomanor is much more of a boom-bust prospect than his public buzz may indicate. If he can shore up his lapses, he could \nbecome a good NFL flanker with 1,000-yard upside. If he can’t, he’ll bounce around the league as a contributor that teams \nthink they can give multiple chances to emerge, but never does.  \n \nWhere is the player inconsistent? I don’t trust Ayomanor against tight coverage. He has targets ripped from his hands. \nHe doesn’t have a strong attack with jump up and through. He clap-attacks targets too often, and he doesn’t attack early \nenough to earn the ball in these scenarios.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Flanker. In time, perhaps a slot.  \nReleases: Ayomanor has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \nAyomanor sinks into his stance with a slight rock off the back leg before releasing from the line with a roll off his front foot. \nHe has reps where he sinks into his stance without the rock off the back foot.  \nHis pads come over his knees and his head and eyes are forward. Ayomanor’s arms swing at full range of motion as he \nsprints off the line.  \nAyomanor has a sudden hesitation and two-quick combo off the line and he counters the defender’s hands with shed or \nswim. He can deliver the hesitation and two-quick combo with a contrast of patience and suddenness. \nAyomanor also has a nice two-quick and stick combo against off-coverage that earns/sustains separation in compressed \nspace. He counters the two-quick with a double swat.  \nAyomanor has patient hesitation and sudden stick with a wipe counter to get inside. He also has a patient read step and \nwipe to get inside. His pair of two-quicks have different pacing when used together with a patient but sudden quality.  \nAyomanor also uses a feet switch and a violent shed to counter the defender’s hands. He’ll use a stutter release mid-stem \nagainst off-coverage.  \nAyomanor uses a double up or two-quick to steal a release in the run game. When a defender is showing the potential for \nthe jam off the line, Ayomanor can feet switch and reduce the shoulder away from the defender’s hands.  \nAyomanor also uses a hip shift in a variety of ways against off-coverage to set up position.  \nSeparation: Ayomanor has the speed to earn two steps on a cornerback on a vertical route downfield – even with the \ndefender beginning the play with his hips turned downfield and anticipating the deep route.  \n\n \n158 \nAyomanor has deep speed to earn vertical targets, but he flips the field with his speed rather than breaks away from \nsafeties over the top with good angles or even fast corners who can make up ground.  \nAyomanor can stack corners at the boundary late in a vertical route, but it’s rare that he stacks. If he did it more often, he’d \nbe in a higher tier. However, if he were stacking more often it would have to do with having more effective release moves \nand earning separation earlier, which he doesn’t. There’s reason to speculate that Ayomanor’s top speed is build-up speed \nand lacking the suddenness to get on top of defenders early.  \nRoute Stems: Ayomanor works at full speed into the back off the defender. He’ll widen stems to do this.  \nAyomanor has a good double up at the top of his stem to set up his speed break on the out. He counters the defender’s \nhands with a wipe.  \nRoute Setups: Ayomanor sells the fade with a long break step and a peek to the outside mid-stem against off-coverage. \nHe’ll then attack downhill into the feet of his coverage before delivering a three-step break.  \nAyomanor will stair-step an in-breaking route with a dive and then sell the vertical before breaking inside. He can dive \ninside and use a stick at the top of his stem to set up a three-step break.  \nHe has a capable inset against off coverage. Especially when delivering the hitch-and-go with good weight drop into a three-\nstep break.  \nRoute Breaks: Ayomanor has a long break step that’s sudden. Because of his sudden break step, there’s some quickness \nwith his drop and pop even without deep weight drop. He also can snap his turns out of his breaks.  \nAyomanor executes short speed outs with a flat drive step and a flat line step. He can begin them with a long break step. \nHis breaks are flat and work back to the ball.  \nHe generates a friendly target for the quarterback out of the break and gets his head around early. \nAyomanor can drop his weight into three-step breaks on short and intermediate routes while running the stem at full speed.  \nZone Routes: Ayomanor identifies the second-level defender and the zone triangle. He works to depth and settles into the \nopen area. He’s quick to adjust his position and slide away from one of the defenders in the triangle to create an open lane \nfor his quarterback.  \nAyomanor breaks across the zones with good tempo to maximize separation. He doesn’t show his eyes until he has passed \nthe rollover/buzz defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Ayomanor can tap the front foot and drag the back foot to get inbounds when extending away from his \nframe for throws near the sideline. He can also toe-tap in stride.  \nPass Tracking: Ayomanor tracks the ball over his shoulder. He has late hands to the ball.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Ayomanor uses underhand attack to catch targets at his beltline. He attacks targets on the numbers \nwith overhand position.  \nAyomanor can dig out low throws below his knees. He’ll also high-point targets.  \nHe has lapses where his hands are too far apart at the attack point and he clap-drops or clap-attacks easy targets – two so \nfar.  \nPosition: Ayomanor can embrace the fall on low throws he digs out. He has a good pullback against tight coverage. He can \nundercut a defender at his back hip on a fade and square the ball while shielding the defender. He can high-point and \npullback in the underneath zone.  \nAyomanor also has good timing and tracking on jump up and through positioning. He can see when he doesn’t need to leave \nhis feet for a high-point and the positioning is good enough. He must improve his positioning so the defender can’t have \neasy access to the ball.  \n\n \n159 \nFocus: Ayomanor can take a hit to the back as he catches the target at his beltline. He can take contact to his back and \nchest in succession on shallow routes caught to his chest. He can take a hard shot to the chest when extending for a target \nin stride over the middle.  \nAgainst tight coverage. Ayomanor has too many lapses where he uses suboptimal attack – underhand when overhand is \nbetter – and clap-attacks because his hands are too wide. Although he can win targets against contact, he loses more than \nhe should—a lot of catches he secures and are pulled or knocked loose as he’s going to the ground.  \nTransitions: Ayomanor catches and pierces downhill and obeys the direction of the ball to dictate where he turns.  \nElusiveness: Ayomanor can adjust his stride and lift his feet over low shots. He has some stop-start skill to at least earn \nsmall gains. \nVision: In the open field, Ayomanor is willing to split defenders to maximize yardage. He’s more of a tackle-breaker who \nspins off contact or runs through it than avoids with dynamic movement.  \nPower: Ayomanor drops his pads to split defenders and keeps his feet moving to drag/push them forward. He can carry a \nsafety on his back five yards. He pulls through reaches and wraps to his frame. His stiff-arm wards off reaches.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Ayomanor can take a hit to his torso from a safety as well as a glancing shot from a linebacker \nand stalemate it.  \nBall Security: Ayomanor carries the ball high and tight to his boundary side arm. He can take contact to the ball carrying \narm. He switches the ball to his boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Ayomanor must refrain from hugging defenders to turn and seal them to the inside on a perimeter play. He can \nshuffle his feet to work outside-in and attack the outside shoulder of the force to defender to seal him inside on a play \ndeveloping on the perimeter.  \nWith Man Over Me assignments, Ayomanor will set up his position by stealing a release. He’ll extend into the defender’s \nchest out of the setup and turn the defender away from the play, moving his feet well to drive the opponent. His extension \nis a little much, but he earns a chest-to-chest position and drives out of a squat stance with his head and eyes up and over \nthe shoulder of the defender.  \nAyomanor can also turn defenders inside with a good underhook. He’ll run off defenders and then tilt into them to secure \nposition and move the defender away from the ball carrier.  \nHe attacks Most Dangerous Man assignments and can reach the safety’s outside shoulder to send him out of the path of the \nball carrier working up the middle.  \nDurability: Ayomanor suffered a knee injury in preseason camp of 2022. He had a season-ending PCL injury in high school \nand played two full seasons afterward.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: At the risk of missing out on a quality receiver, I’d rather not have Ayomanor on my \nboard in rookie drafts before the NFL Draft. Unless he falls to the fourth round, and none of the RSP’s top-15 receivers are \navailable, I’ll pass. Once Ayomanor’s landing spot is known, there might be reason to adjust his value upward.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nElic Ayomanor’s speed \n• \nRelease, Sudden Break Step, Peek, Three-Step Break, Snap Turn \n• \nTwo-Quick and Stick, Flat Drive/Line Steps in Compressed Area \n• \nMost Dangerous Man Blocking Assignment \n• \nTwo Read Steps, Sells Vertical, and Three-Step Break \n• \nCatch over Middle vs. Hard Contact to Chest \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n\n \n160",
        "analysis": "Elic Ayomanor is a boom-or-bust wide receiver prospect with intriguing tools but consistency issues.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Release Package:**  Possesses a diverse and effective set of release moves, using footwork and hand counters to gain early separation.  He shows good patience and suddenness in his releases.\n* **Speed:**  Has deep speed, capable of flipping the field vertically.\n* **Route Running:**  Executes sharp route breaks, particularly three-step breaks, and sells routes effectively.  Shows understanding of zone coverage concepts.\n* **Catch Radius:**  Can high-point and dig out low throws, demonstrating a versatile catch style.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a blocker, particularly in man-over-man situations.  He is willing to engage and drive defenders.\n* **After the Catch:** Willing to break tackles and fight for extra yardage.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Consistency:**  His biggest weakness is consistency.  He often gains early separation but fails to maintain it, allowing defenders to recover.  His catch point execution is inconsistent, leading to drops and opportunities for defenders to make plays on the ball.  He struggles particularly against tight coverage.\n* **Top Speed Maintenance:**  While possessing good speed, he doesn't always maintain it throughout routes, allowing faster defenders to catch up.\n* **Catch Point Technique:** Needs to improve his hand placement and attack the ball more aggressively to minimize dropped passes and improve his catch percentage in tight coverage. He frequently \"clap-attacks\" instead of using optimal hand placement.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report compares him to Adonai Mitchell, Marquez Callaway, and Jaray Jenkins. This suggests a player with potential but inconsistency, likely destined for a role player rather than a star.  The comparison range indicates he's not a guaranteed top-tier prospect.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nAyomanor's potential is high, but his inconsistency makes him a risky prospect.  He needs to refine his technique at the catch point, improve his consistency maintaining speed and separation throughout his routes, and become more reliable against tight coverage. If he addresses these issues, he could become a productive NFL flanker; otherwise, he might struggle to find a consistent role.  His draft stock is likely to be higher than the RSP ranking suggests, but his ultimate success will depend on ironing out the inconsistencies in his game.\n"

This is usually the difficult part of route \nrunning, but he does it well.  \n \nThis is valuable for a receiver who lacks top-end speed, but has good acceleration. Bryant will do much of his work within 30 \nyards of the line of scrimmage. If Bryant can develop the same nuance with his releases, he can become an equally adept \nroute runner against man and zone coverage.  \n \n\n \n161 \nBryant does good work uncovering against tight coverage late in routes with his back to the ball. He has late hands and the \ncoverage doesn’t distract him as he makes the catch.  \n \nBryant has a habit with clap-attacks, but the range of the clapping is small and manageable with a lot of targets, even if not \nideal. After the catch, Bryant’s footwork and agility come into play. He navigates traffic well and can make multiple \ndefenders miss while still heading downhill.  \n \nBryant’s best-case scenario is a career as a third or fourth receiver who can make plays, but might be limited to that role. If \nhe can prove his acceleration and quickness compensate for his lack of top-end speed, Bryant might have more to offer as a \nflanker-slot hybrid.  \n \nReleases: Bryant has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee. He sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot as he begins his release.  \nBryant pushes the vertical during his stem—his pads are of his knees and his arms move at nearly maximum range of \nmotion.  \nBryant rocks off his back foot before rolling off his front foot on a lot of releases that take an angle outside or inside. When \nreleasing downhill against a defender, he has reps where there is no wasted motion, but it is not the norm.  \nBryant uses a two-quick release to attack inside leverage from an off-man defender to set up an outside release. He \ncounters the defender’s hands with a swat.  \nBryant uses a feet-switch to get outside a defender with inside leverage and reduce his shoulder to counter the defender’s \nhands.  \nBryant uses a two-quick to attack inside leverage and counters the defender’s hands with a swat. At the top of stems of in-\nbreaking routes he uses a double up. Neither footwork technique has any pacing variation with the execution.  \nBryant uses a two-quick and read step in succession to set up an inside release, but the movements need greater range of \nmotion and more artistry with pacing.  \nBryant has a sudden read step and shed counter to attack inside leverage. He uses both to steal a release.  \nHe uses a hesitation to set up off-coverage. He counters a defender’s hands with a wipe when breaking downhill in the flat.  \nBryant reduces the shoulder from inside leverage when releasing outside.  \nHe uses a double up to get outside defenders playing tight. He has a hard stick inside against inside leverage that’s playing \noff him.  \nSeparation: Bryant can beat cornerbacks up the boundary on fade routes that cover the intermediate and vertical ranges \nin distance ( 20-30 yards). He will stack deep-range routes once he’s 25-30 yards downfield. He has the acceleration and \nspeed to split safeties in the open field, flip the field, and force a cornerback to chase him down, but it might take the \ndefender 35-50 yards to do so.  \nRoute Stems: Bryant widens stems against outside leverage to set up a break inside on the go route. He dives against \ninside leverage.  \nHe will attack the stem with a good sale of the vertical and run the stem at full speed to set up a break back to the \nquarterback.  \nRoute Setups: Bryant plays with pacing on the out and up. He accelerates into the speed out portion of the route. \nBryant stair-steps in-breaking routes against man-to-man coverage. He’ll peek to the boundary with a stick and an \nexaggerated head fake to the boundary.  \nBryant can peek and deliver insets at the top of his stems. He sells stems with head fakes. His out-and-up is an effective \nroute in part due to his head fake where he looks back to the QB during the out phase of the route.  \nHe widens his stems and works into the back of off-coverage.  \n\n \n162 \nEven when he’s not using head fakes or elaborate setups, he uses his eyes well to set up breaks late in the stem.  \nRoute Breaks: Bryant has a drop and pop break with a long break step and weight drop. He has flat drive and line steps \nwith speed outs. He gets his head around during the break and works back to the quarterback. \nBryant also delivers flat drive and line steps on outs after delivering a long break step into a three-step break with weight \ndrop.  \nWhen Bryant’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he works with his quarterback to find open space.  \nZone Routes: Bryant identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles in the open zone. He creates a \nfriendly target to the quarterback. When working between zone defenders and across the zone, he tempos his breaks and \nwaits to turn his head until he has worked past the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Bryant toe taps the boundary and drags a knee.  \nPass Tracking: Bryant displays late hands during fade routes against tight coverage at his chest. He extends for targets \nover his head without leaving his feet unnecessarily.  \nBryant tracks the ball over his shoulder with underhand attack close to his chest, but he catches the ball with his hands and \ndoesn’t trap it. He tracks the ball behind his break path while looking and extending over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Bryant can extend above his head and catch the ball with overhand position. When he loses focus \nand doesn’t look the ball into his hands, he’ll drop a target. His penchant for small clap-attacks doesn’t help here. He can \nalso extend away from his frame.  \nPosition: Bryant can reinforce his separation late in a route by extending his hands to meet the oncoming defender and \nkeep him from breaking that bubble of space long enough to extend for the ball. He has a good pullback and he embraces \nthe fall.  \nFocus: Bryant earns targets with coverage tight to his chest.  \nTransitions: Bryant will catch and pierce downhill. He obeys the location of the ball to dictate his turn downhill.  \nElusiveness: Bryant only needs two small steps to transition from a perimeter track to a downhill track when working to \nthe far-side boundary. He has a tight spin and can execute it within steps after running over a defender at the boundary, so \nhe can remain inbounds and generate additional yardage.  \nVision: Bryant adjusts his path in traffic to work toward open space. He knows when to attack a defender and when to \navoid him. He has good feel for unexpected obstacles and making efficient moves to avoid them – short stutters, small \njump cuts, and tight spins. He splits defenders in the open field.  \nPower: Bryant pulls through reaches to his lower legs. He keeps his feet moving through contact and can pull forward. He \nkeeps his pads down at the end of a run. He runs through wraps from safeties.  \nBryant has an effective stiff-arm to shed a safety’s hit and wrap attempt. He also wards off reaches to his frame with the \nmove.  \nHe will press unblocked defenders to set up cutbacks behind blockers.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Bryant can run over a cornerback when he has the momentum downhill.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off glancing shots to his side from cornerbacks. Bryant has an effective balance \ntouch through contact to his lower legs.  \nBall Security: Bryant has lapses where he tucks the ball to his right arm even when catching a target in the left flat and \nworking to the boundary. However, he can use the boundary-side arm or the arm away from the nearest pursuit. He carries \nthe ball high to his chest.  \nBryant allows the ball to swing loose from his frame when running in the open field. He only tightens up when he sees \ndefenders closing on him.  \n\n \n163 \nBlocking: With Most Dangerous Man assignments Bryant earns a flat lead and closes the gap between himself and the \nsafety so there’s no air between them. As Bryant strikes with tight hands into the chest of the defender, he slides his lower \nbody around to earn a square and squat position.  \nHe’ll earn a flat lead against outside linebackers but he doesn’t close the gap and get his arms inside.  \nBryant is prone to overextending with his pads and head when delivering a strike. The force of the strike can be enough for \nhim to correct his position fast and sustain the block.  \nWith Man Over Me assignments, Bryant is quick to counter the hands of the defender if beaten to the punch and deliver his \nwith good positioning. He moves his feet well enough to force a defender wide of the ball carrier.  \nAfter running an out, Bryant will tilt into his coverage and transition to a blocker. He closes the gap between himself and the \ndefender. He turns the defender away from the ball carrier and moves his feet well to do it.  \nByrant uses one-arm technique effectively after the defender creates some separation off the initial Man Over Me block. \nBryant can peel off a good shield of a Man Over Me assignment and square and strike a Most Dangerous Man assignment in \nbackside pursuit on a perimeter run, effectively sealing the edge for his teammate.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Bryant from afar pre-NFL Draft. Post-NFL Draft, consider Bryant for the late \nrounds of leagues with rookie drafts of 6-8 rounds if Bryant earns a Day Three selection from the NFL.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPre- and Post-Catch Positioning on the Fade \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n164",
        "analysis": "Pat Bryant is a 6'4\", 204-pound wide receiver from Illinois, ranked WR25 by RSP.  His game is characterized by excellent route-running skills, particularly his ability to set up and execute breaks, making him effective within 30 yards of the line of scrimmage.  While lacking top-end speed, he possesses good acceleration and agility after the catch, allowing him to navigate traffic and elude defenders.  He displays strong hands and consistently tracks the ball well, even in tight coverage.  His blocking ability is also a plus, showing potential in both man and zone blocking schemes.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Exceptional at setting up and executing breaks, especially effective in the intermediate range.  Displays nuance in his route stems and setups, utilizing head fakes and pacing to create separation.\n* **After the Catch:**  Agile and elusive, capable of making multiple defenders miss and gaining extra yards.  Good vision and footwork in traffic.\n* **Hands and Tracking:** Secure hands, even with tight coverage.  Consistently tracks the ball well, extending to make catches both high and low.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a blocker, with effective techniques in both man and zone situations.\n* **Late-Route Separation:**  Ability to create separation even late in routes against tight coverage.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Releases:**  While showing proficiency in several release techniques, consistency and artistry in pacing and range of motion need refinement.\n* **Top-End Speed:**  Lack of top-end speed limits his deep-threat potential; improvement in this area would significantly expand his role.\n* **Consistency in Ball Security:**  Occasional lapses in ball security need addressing.\n* **Expand Role:**  Currently projected as a rotational player/third or fourth receiver; proving his quickness and acceleration could elevate his status to a flanker-slot hybrid.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum (Chris Godwin - Brenden Rice/X – Damon Hazelton) suggests a player with a range of potential outcomes.  Godwin represents a high-end ceiling as a productive, versatile receiver. Rice/X suggests a player who might excel in a specific role, while Hazelton indicates a potential for a more limited role.  This reflects Bryant's potential to be either a productive starter or a valuable rotational player depending on his development.  The comparisons highlight the uncertainty surrounding his ultimate NFL role.\n"

Felton is a high-ceiling prospect with a trap door leading to a deep \ndrop.  \n \nFelton is a speedy option with a lot of skills as a route runner. He has a wide array of release maneuvers and route setups, \nbut he must refine the smaller details so he can execute everything with precision and believability.  \n \n\n \n165 \nFelton’s breaks are already sharp and have enough deceleration for him to earn separation on timing routes. He could \nbecome one of the best man-to-man receivers in this class. \n \nHis zone routes need more work. He must demonstrate better awareness of the zone triangle so he knows when to settle \nand when to continue tempoing his break across the middle.  \n \nAll of these details pale in comparison to his catch-point woes. Felton’s hands are too wide as he begins his attack, and it \nleads to clap-attacks.  \n \nThat’s not all. Felton opts for suboptimal attacks based on the height of the target. He also allows the ball into his frame.  \n \nWhen Felton holds onto the ball, he’s a creative playmaker with the ball in his hands. He can generate yardage with or \nwithout blockers and the potential for big plays is always there.  \n \nFelton’s talent level is strong, but his errors are critical and might frustrate teams that see the high ceiling apparent in his \ngame. He could help as a return specialist and earn a shot to develop his game to its potential.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? His initial release has cut out the wasted movement as the season progressed.  \nTechnical: When facing tight coverage on a timing route and breaking back to the quarterback, Felton allows the ball into \nhis frame to attack underhand and the defender can reach the ball and knock it away or knock it loose from him.  \nHe must work on attacking early with overhand position with targets like these at the numbers. There’s also some clap-\nattacking limited to over the shoulder targets and high and behind targets.  \nReleases: Felton has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side \nof his front leg.  \nFelton sinks into his stance to begin his release. He has a slight rock off the back foot before rolling off his front foot. This is \na habit of his, but he has shown in isolated circumstance – and on the same routes – that he can come off the line without \nwasted motion.  \nHis pads come over his knees as he begins his stem and he pumps his arms with full motion. He brings his pads up before \nexecuting a hard three-step break with weight drop. This can be fixed.  \nFelton uses a two-quick release to steal a release in the run game. He uses a read step to set up a wide route on an RPO or \nscreen. He also uses a trigger step to set up screens. Both steps could have more violence to sell them.  \nWhen he’s running a deep route, Felton’s two-quick has the right balance of patience and suddenness. He also reduces the \nshoulder to counter the defender’s hands after issuing the two-quick. Felton uses a wipe when the defender shoots his \nhands a second time during the stem.  \nFelton has a three-quick release for breaks inside.  \nFelton’s double-up to set up a short slant has patience and suddenness. His read step to set up an over route also has \npatience and suddenness. Felton has a hard stick at the top of the stem.  \nFelton has an effective hesitation coupled with a two-quick to set up a short speed break. He’ll also counter with a shed. He \nalso uses a two-quick and a double-up combo at the top of his stem.  \nAgainst off-coverage, Felton has a hip shift with a head fake to set up the defender. He counters with a wipe or a reduction \nof the shoulder. He needs more patience and suddenness with the hip shift and more range of lateral movement within the \nshift so the defender moves off his spot.  \nIt would also be helpful if Felton made better decisions with when to try the hip shift. There are routes where the defender \nis too far inside to earn separation with a break inside. \nHis head fakes with two-quicks are violent. He has a sudden stutter with head fake and a wipe counter.  \n\n \n166 \nSeparation: Felton can get a step on press-man coverage on intermediate and vertical routes and he can pull away from a \ndefender in the deep game after hand-fighting. He’ll hand-fight with a defender up the sideline and win vertical-range go \nroutes and fades with late separation.  \nFelton can stack man-to-man in the intermediate range of the field. I need to see him stack more often.  \nRoute Stems: Felton will widen outside or dive inside with stems to set up vertical routes. He’ll take the back of the \ndefender when given it. He’ll also run at the defender and use a stick to the outside at the top of the stem before breaking \ninside.  \nRoute Setups: Felton delivers a good peek along with a widening of his stem at the top of the stem to set up the deep \npost. He will move the safety with the use of his head and eyes in conjunction with his stemming.  \nFelton stair-steps off the dive of his stem against the safety to set up the sail route. He has a capable in-set to set up off-\ncoverage. He also delivers violent head fakes inside and outside – sometimes in succession – to hold or move coverage \nbefore the break.  \nRoute Breaks: Felton has an effective drop-and-pop break where he drops his weight with the inside step and then turns \ninside off the outside step. He can use a long break step at the top of his stem into a drop-and-pop break.  \nFelton also has an effective three-step break with weight drop. He has a tell where he brings his pads up before the break, \nbut otherwise, the break itself is sound. He will break back to the quarterback against tight coverage.  \nFelton runs out of hard breaks on curls. He has an excellent footwork combination at the top of his stem to work outside-in \non a whip route. Good weight drop into the break as well.  \nHis speed breaks on shallow routes have sharp enough drive and line steps to earn a flat break. Felton’s speed breaks on \nintermediate routes lack that sharp drive and line step and he fades out of the break.  \nWhen Felton turns on a slant, he snaps his upper body to the potential target.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target and his quarterback breaks the pocket, Felton effortlessly changes direction to the \nnext open zone to create an open target for his passer.  \nZone Routes: Felton identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break across the zone between \nthe closest defenders while squaring to the quarterback. He’ll settle into the open space on shallow zone routes between \nzone defenders.  \nFelton has lapses with identifying the zone triangle with the buzz/rollover defender and doesn’t tempo away from that \ndefender. Instead, he settles. \nWhen breaking with tempo across the zone, he must wait until he crosses the buzz/rollover defender to show his eyes to \nthe quarterback. He does this better in less condensed spaces of one coverage, but even there, he has reps where he shows \nhis eyes too early.  \nFelton identifies corner blitzes and adjusts for the quarterback under the safety playing over the top.  \nRoute Boundary: Felton is aware of the end-line when tracking a ball directly over his head and can get one foot inbounds \nwhile trying to shorten the stride of the second foot to get that one in the field of play. Felton can drag his feet at the \nendline while tracking the ball over his shoulder  \nPass Tracking: When running screens and a target has the trajectory at his helmet or slightly above, Felton leaves his feet \nunnecessarily.  \nFelton tracks the ball directly over his head or from right to left with his back to the ball as if he were an outfielder. He \ndisplays late hands with his back to the ball against tight coverage.  \nHe is prone to clap-attacking vertical targets arriving over his shoulder when extending his arms late to the ball. Felton \neither clap-attacks or his hands are too wide and the ball bounces off one hand.  \n\n \n167 \nHands/Catch Radius: Felton uses overhand position to attack targets at the numbers. He uses underhand position to \ntrack targets over his head. When the ball is away from his frame, Felton will leave his feet and deliver a full-body extension \nwith arms well away from his frame for the target. He’ll catch targets wide of his frame.  \nFelton can turn behind his break path on a wide route and extend for a target wide of his back shoulder and continue the \nspin so it’s a 360-degree turn. He can also dig out low throws near the boundary and embrace the fall near the boundary.  \nFelton must work on attacking the ball at the earliest point against tight coverage when breaking back to the target. When \nwide open with a cushion, he attacks the ball at the earliest point.  \nPosition: Felton can high-point a target and execute a pullback from the defender coming from over the top to his inside \nshoulder as he makes the catch. Felton can extend toward the endline and embrace the fall as he lands.  \nFelton must time jump up and through technique earlier. He’s late and struggles to reach the ball. He has a pull-back when \nhe earns a high-point or jump up and through that’s successful.  \nHe will embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Felton wins fade routes against tight coverage. When facing tight coverage on a timing route and breaking back to \nthe quarterback, Felton allows the ball into his frame to attack underhand and the defender can reach the ball and knock it \naway or knock it loose from him. He must work on attacking early with overhand position with targets like these at the \nnumbers.  \nFelton can catch the target and maintain possession after turning into a hard hit to his chest as he secures the ball. He can \nalso break into a hit to the chest as he high-points a slant.  \nTransitions: Felton executes catch and pierce principles as a receiver turning into a ball carrier. He’s aware of the position \nof the defender and delivers a tight spin away from the pursuit angle.  \nFelton will obey the trajectory of the ball and turn downfield in the direction the placement of the pass dictates.  \nElusiveness: Felton has a capable stutter step in traffic to set up a safety pursuing downhill. He’ll at least prevent a direct \nhit or wrap of both legs. Felton has a short-range jump cut to work away from downhill pursuit as he crosses the width of \nthe field.  \nFelton only needs two small/quick steps to transition 90 degrees as a runner. He has quick stop-start movement to cut \nagainst the grain of pursuit inside and over the top.  \nFelton will step over low shots with high knees/feet. He has good jukes against safeties over the top, delivering a compact \nhip shift to give and take the leg away that the defender is attacking.  \nFelton has enough stop-start quickness to avoid the pursuit of linebackers from the backside as he works up the boundary.  \nHe will press downhill to set up a tight spin on an unblocked defender.  \nVision: Felton identifies the appropriate lane behind two lead blockers on screens and RPOs. He knows when to press inside \nand toward an unblocked defender so he has room to bounce and split his blockers.  \nHe creates with and without blockers and handles unanticipated pursuit well. He’s a creative mover who also can maintain a \ndownhill mentality and manage the situation and the game.  \nPower: Felton drops his pads into cornerbacks coming downhill to wrap him. He leads with a forearm shiver into the \ncontact. He also has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame.  \nHe can keep his feet moving through the contact. Felton pulls through reaches and wraps to his upper body. He’ll keep his \nfeet when a corner and a safety wrap him and his teammates can rally to generate a push.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Felton stalemates CBs hitting him from over the top.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Felton can bounce off indirect shots to his pads from safeties, stalemating the encounter. He \nuses a balance-touch technique, bracing the turf with one hand as he runs, when changing direction in dramatic fashion.  \n\n \n168 \nBall Security: Felton carries the ball high to his chest. The elbow is loose from his side. He can take a hit to his ball-\ncarrying arm.  \nFelton is prone to carrying the ball under his right arm even when he’s outside the left hash when he earns the ball and \nworking toward pursuit that’s coming from his right side. When given the ball on a play design to the left on a fly sweep, \nhe’ll use his left arm.  \nBlocking: When executing Man Over Me assignments, Felton earns a squat and square stance within a couple of yards of \nthe defender. He overextends rather than close the gap with his feet. His hands are tight enough to aim for the chest of the \ndefender, but his arms are extended too much because he overextends. He’s not bending enough at the elbows because he \nmust close the gap tighter.  \nFelton is a patient stalk blocker against defender’s playing a significant cushion, but he still is about 1-2 steps too far from \nclosing the gap so his arms aren’t so straight at the engagement point. On the occasions where he closes the gap, his \nelbows are bent and it’s at this point he makes it difficult for defensive backs to disengage from him.  \nFelton will take the outside shoulder of his assignment at the line of scrimmage when blocking the force player – the OLB or \nS. He’ll move his feet once he engages and generate a push to the inside. He’s also good at working through the line of \nscrimmage to the second level so he can square a safety.  \nFelton may get put on his ass, but he creates a clear obstacle. He’ll also take the defender where he wants to go and use \nthat defender’s momentum to his advantage. He’ll take the inside shoulder of a linebacker and turn him outside just long \nenough for a back to get into the hole.  \nFelton will also drive his shoulder into the linebacker at an angle where he can turn the opponent inside on perimeter runs \nwith the hook of his outside arm.  \nFelton can’t anchor against larger safeties and off-ball linebackers, but he’ll shield and, after the defender disengages to \nchase downfield, Felton will chase and follow up with a punch that can knock the defender off-balance.  \nAfter his break on a short route, Felton will run off a defender when he sees his quarterback breaking the pocket to his side \nof the field.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Felton is one of those players I’d consider late in a draft because the ceiling is high \nenough at a rock-bottom level of risk. Beware that he’s likely one of those players who lights up practice and falls apart in \ngames so he’ll require clear boundaries from you in terms of how much time you’ll give him a spot on your roster.  \n \nMy recommendation: If Felton isn’t looking vastly improved by the middle of his second season, it’s time to cut ties. If you \ncan’t wait that long, you’re only investing in him during the summer to see if he hits early and big.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nTracking Directly Overhead and Boundary Work \n• \nWidening Stem and Peek to Manipulate the Safety \n• \nSmarts-Effort vs. OLB in Run Game \n• \nHooks and Turns the OLB in the Run Game \n• \nPress-and-Bounce Patience as A Runner \n• \nFade Route with Patient-Sudden Release Combo and Buys Back Boundary Patiently \n• \nUses OLB’s Movement to His Advantage as A Blocker \n• \nStair-Step Technique vs. Inverted C3 Safety on 3rd and 13 \n• \nAllows Ball into Frame While Breaking Back to QB—Drop vs. Contact \n• \nClap-Attacks Vertical Routes Over Shoulder \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n\n \n169",
        "analysis": "## Tai Felton: NFL Draft Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **High Ceiling:** Possesses exceptional speed, a wide array of route-running skills and release maneuvers, and impressive after-the-catch ability.  His sharp breaks and deceleration allow him to create separation, particularly on timing routes and against man coverage. He excels at manipulating safeties with head and eye movements and stemming techniques.  He's shown flashes of being a creative playmaker with the ball in his hands, generating yards with or without blockers.  He displays good vision and elusiveness as a runner, capable of making defenders miss in various ways.  Strong ball security when carrying high and to his chest.  He’s a willing and effective blocker, particularly in moving defenders to create running lanes.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Technique:**  Felton's biggest weakness is his inconsistent hand technique and catch point issues.  His hands are often too wide (\"clap-attacks\"), leading to drops, especially on over-the-shoulder targets.  He needs to improve his attack point on the ball, particularly against tight coverage.  He needs to be more consistent with his release, eliminating wasted movement to become more explosive off the line.\n* **Improve Zone Awareness:** While he shows flashes of understanding zone concepts, his awareness of zone triangles needs improvement. He sometimes settles into coverage rather than tempoing his breaks effectively.\n* **Consistency:**  His game is characterized by significant highs and lows.  He needs to demonstrate consistent execution of his already-impressive skill set to become a reliable NFL receiver.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum of Jameson Williams – X – Quez Watkins highlights his potential.  \n\n* **Jameson Williams:** Represents his high-end potential – explosive speed and big-play ability.  However, Williams' injury history and inconsistent hands are relevant parallels to Felton's own concerns.\n\n* **Quez Watkins:** Shows a more realistic baseline – a speedster with a role as a deep threat who can contribute on special teams.  This represents Felton's floor if he doesn't address his technical flaws.\n\n* **Terry McLaurin (implied):** The \"elevator pitch\" suggests that with improved technique, Felton could reach McLaurin's level – a consistent, reliable receiver with good hands and route running. This underscores the potential for significant improvement.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nTai Felton is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His athleticism and skillset are undeniable, but his technical deficiencies, especially concerning his hands and route consistency, need immediate attention. His success in the NFL will hinge on his ability to overcome these weaknesses.  He's a likely late-round pick who could provide value as a return specialist while developing his offensive game.  He needs clear boundaries in terms of roster time and patience from whichever team drafts him to allow for him to develop into his full potential.\n"

He \nhas excellent stop-start quickness, which works best in the open field and with his releases from the line of scrimmage.  \n \nGet Williams into space and he’ll move the chains, if not break a chunk play for his offense. At this stage of his \ndevelopment, he does his best work against zone coverage and one-on-one in the vertical game.  \n \n\n \n170 \nWilliams must develop better setups during his stems and snap his turns with greater frequency during his breaks if he \nwants to improve his route running against man coverage. In addition to tightening up his routes, Williams must tighten his \nhands so he cuts down on unforced drops.  \n \nIt will benefit Williams to develop a better plan to position himself for the catch on vertical routes with the ball in the air. \nHe’s an athletic player with potential to become a big-play starter, but getting players to do the catch-point work to improve \ncan be a boom-bust proposition.  \n \nIf things go well, Williams develops into a player where fans can see some similarities to Chris Olave. If they don’t, Williams \nwill be fighting for the final spots on rosters or spend most of his career on special teams.  \n \nReleases: Williams has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. Williams’ hands hang at \neither side of his front knee.  \nWhen Williams begins his release, he leads forward more than he sinks into his stance and he rocks off the back foot before \nrolling off the front foot. He has shown that he can release without wasted motion, but he can still sink deeper into his \nstance.  \nWilliams has a hesitation off the line against tight coverage and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe. He has a \npatient-but-sudden two-quick that he uses to steal a release or earn a release inside on a passing play. He uses a patient \nhesitation with a sudden read step to steal a release.  \nWilliams uses a hesitation and feet-switch combo to attack inside leverage at the line of scrimmage. His double up is sudden \nand he can deliver a patient but sudden setup to the double up. He’ll combine the feet-switch and double up to earn \nseparation outside a defender playing outside leverage.  \nWilliams has a shed counter to counter a defender’s hands. He uses a stick at the top of his stem against off-coverage. He \nreduces the shoulder against outside leverage.  \nHe also has a swat counter to a defender’s hands from inside leverage.  \nWilliams has a blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed against inside leverage playing off him.  \nWilliams delivers a hip shift with a wipe counter against off-coverage with out-breaking routes. It’s not always the case, but \nhe has delivered 2-3 hip shifts that have an excellent patience and suddenness.  \nSeparation: He has excellent stop-start quickness and it shows up when releasing from the line of scrimmage. His \nacceleration is good enough to beat angles of pursuit from defensive backs coming downhill or from the backside of the \nfield. He can flip the field while working up the middle, across the field, and up the opposite boundary.  \nWilliams has the long speed to stack late in a route.  \nRoute Stems: Williams will run at a defender’s feet at the top of a stem on fade routes. He’ll widen stems.  \nRoute Setups: Williams has in-breakers where he’ll use a stair-step, but doesn’t emphasize the direction changes enough \nfor it to be effective. He also uses a hip shift against off-coverage but doesn’t emphasize the direction changes with this \neither.  \nWilliams uses a peek effectively at the top of his stems on vertical routes.  \nRoute Breaks: Williams has a pop and drop break with a long break step, but he can drop his weight a lot more to \ngenerate quicker deceleration. Williams presents a friendly position to the target and also runs away from the coverage, \nsliding to the open area.  \nWilliams’ speed breaks have flat drive step and line steps. His speed breaks need snap at the turn. He showed this once in \nfive games on a speed out with a punch of the boundary arm and snap.  \nWhen his first route doesn’t earn a target, he will work to the open area.  \nZone Routes: Williams identifies second-level defenders, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He snaps his head \naround fast, but doesn’t snap his turns with his head.  \n\n \n171 \nRoute Boundary: Williams can work to the boundary and toe-tap to get his feet inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: He tracks targets over his shoulder and displays late hands.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Williams digs out low throws with underhand position. His hands can be too wide and this leads to \ndrops with these targets.  \nWilliams high-points effectively. He also extends away from his frame for the ball and uses optimal attack position so he can \ntransition downhill.  \nWilliams has lapses where he uses underhand attack high on the numbers and his hands aren’t in ideal position to earn the \nball, which leads to dropped passes. There’s a lot of clap-attacking of targets.  \nPosition: Williams will embrace the fall when digging out low throws.  \nFocus: When working against tight coverage at his chest on an underthrown fade route, Williams can lapse into clap-\nattacking the football with underhand position.  \nTransitions: Williams transitions downhill with catch-and-pierce principles. He also obeys the path of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Williams has a tight spin away from reaches and forces defenders to wrap up. He has good curvilinear speed \nand bends downhill.  \nWilliams delivers jump cuts to avoid downhill pursuit. He ducks under contact when one-on-one with a defender over the \ntop.  \nHe can cross the width of the field, build speed, and transition at the boundary with two small steps to get downhill.  \nVision: Williams will split defenders in traffic. He identifies unexpected pursuit/penetration and acts quickly to avoid it. \nWilliams is a patient runner on perimeter plays. He presses inside to set up outside lanes. He handles unanticipated pursuit \nangles effectively. He’s also a creative runner who takes appropriate risks. \nPower: Williams pulls through reaches to his frame. He can pull through multiple reaches when he’s accelerating through \ncontact. He uses his stiff-arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He bounces off glancing shots and can pull forward or \npushes through wraps to fall forward.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Williams drops his pads into oncoming defenders and bounces off these glancing shots from \nsafeties.  \nBall Security: Williams carries the ball under his boundary-side arm and loose from his chest, but he can take contact to \nhis ball-carrying arm.   \nBlocking: Williams slides inside Man Over Me assignments and earns a squat and square position. His hands are tight \nenough to aim for the defender’s chest.  \nDurability: Williams missed four games in five years – three in 2022.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Williams is worth a late-round pick in leagues with 5-7 rounds in their rookie drafts \nbecause of his speed and big-play skill in the open field. The drops could send Williams packing early in his career so it will \nbe wise not to let him clog your roster if there are no signs of life within 18 months of selecting him.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStems at Defender on the Fade \n• \nSerial Clap-Attacker \n• \nHouse Calls A Slant \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n\n \n172",
        "analysis": "## Kyle Williams: Player Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Speed and Open-Field Ability:** Williams possesses excellent speed and stop-start quickness, allowing him to win one-on-one matchups vertically and create big plays after the catch. He excels at flipping the field and creating yards after contact.\n* **Zone Coverage Proficiency:** He's particularly effective against zone coverages, identifying second-level defenders and finding open space.\n* **Release Techniques:**  He demonstrates a variety of effective release techniques from the line of scrimmage, including hesitations, foot switches, and counters to defender's hand placement.  He can create separation quickly.\n* **High-Pointing Ability:** He effectively high-points the ball and extends away from his frame to make catches.\n* **Elusiveness and Ball Carrier Vision:** Williams is elusive after the catch, utilizing jump cuts, spins, and creative running to avoid tackles.  He displays good vision and decision-making in the open field.\n* **Blocking Potential:** Shows promise in pass blocking, with solid technique and hand placement.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  Needs to improve his route running, particularly against man coverage.  He needs to develop better setups and snap his turns more consistently.\n* **Hand Strength and Catch Consistency:** Must reduce drops stemming from inconsistent hand placement and technique. Improving his focus and hand position will be crucial.\n* **Catch-Point Improvement:**  While he high-points well, he needs to consistently position himself optimally at the catch point for better consistency on all types of throws.\n* **Developing a Full Route Tree:** While proficient in vertical routes and against zones, expanding his route tree and demonstrating reliability on various concepts will significantly increase his NFL value.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  Chris Olave\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWilliams is a high-upside prospect with intriguing speed and playmaking ability.  His success hinges on significantly improving his route running consistency, reducing drops, and refining his catch-point technique.  If he can address these weaknesses, he has the potential to become a productive NFL starter; otherwise, he risks becoming a special teams player or being cut early in his career.  The Chris Olave comparison reflects his potential, but the significant drop concerns suggest a higher bust potential than a comparable player like Olave showed coming out of college.\n"

A quarterback at San Jose State from 2019-2021, Nash has been \na full-time receiver since 2022.  \n \nNash is a good route runner with effective short-area acceleration and change-of-direction quickness, but his long speed is \nat the bottom range of starter value as a flanker. One of the promising aspects of Nash’s game is his release work at the \nline of scrimmage.  \n \n\n \n173 \nNash has a wide variety of maneuvers, and he combines many of them with the appropriate balance of patience and \nsuddenness to bait defenders out of position. Once into his route, Nash understands the value of setups and only needs to \nmake some tweaks to become adept at all of them.  \n \nNash has good hands. He’s skilled at earning targets away from his frame. He must attack targets earlier that are arriving \non his numbers.  \n \nNash is especially skilled at earning position in contested scenarios. If he can quell the clap-attacking in these situations, \nhe’ll have a greater opportunity to become a go-to receiver in an offensive rotation.  \n \nNash has the frame, athletic ability, and burgeoning technique of a slot-flanker hybrid that a team can use to generate \nmatchup advantages.  \n \nExpect Nash to earn a pick this spring no earlier than the fifth round. If Nash earns draft capital, it will heighten his chances \nof working into a supporting role within a year or two.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? He’s used on either side of the field and plays outside and inside. He plays the X and the \nslot.  \nPhysical: Nash has effective short-area acceleration and change-of-direction quickness. His long speed is a question mark. \nIt appears fast enough for him to operate inside and earn vertical routes outside with play-action as a boost, but he’s not \ngoing to beat primary cornerbacks one-on-one in man coverage on a regular basis.  \nReleases: Nash has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side \nof his front knee.  \nWhen he releases from the line, Nash sinks into his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion. His pads are \nover his knees and his head is up. He drums his arms with good range.  \nNash will steal a release in the running game with a stick. He’ll counter a defender’s hands with a wipe. Nash also has a \ndouble-up with the inside foot and a swim counter to get outside a defender playing inside shade. Nash attacks the leverage \nfirst and then works away.  \nNash will also use a read step and a two-quick to set up a defender playing inside leverage. He’ll counter with a wipe. His \nread-step and wipe counter is patient but sudden. Nash combines a hesitation and a stick to set up a slant. He’ll combine a \nhesitation with a three-quick and a swim counter as another way of working the slant. The pacing is good with these \nreleases.  \nNash also combines a hesitation with a stick and a swat-swim counter on the diamond release into a slant.  \nNash has a read-step and counters the defender’s hands with a shed and a lean-in. When working behind a receiver on a \ntwo-man route combination, Nash will release off the line with a stutter. His wipe counters have violence against off-man \ncoverage.  \nNash’s foot-switch and double up is an effective combo for a release outside a defender. Against off-coverage, Nash has an \neffective hip shift executed at full speed against off-coverage and counters with a wipe.  \nNash combines a double up with the inside foot and a stick with the outside foot to release inside an outside shade \ndefender. He also combines a stutter-and-stick combination to set up a fade from the slot. For slants and crossers, he has a \nthree-quick with a wipe counter.  \nNash has a shed. He also uses a shoulder reduction and shed combination (a blade release) against off-coverage in zone.  \nNash uses a swat at the top of the stem on a short speed out. He reduces his shoulder from a defender’s hands coming \nfrom the inside.  \nWhen running shorter routes, Nash sets up an in-breaker with a hesitation and a stick. With the whip route against tight \nman coverage, Nash has a patient but sudden double up.  \nSeparation: Nash has the speed to separate from an off-coverage safety with stems that take him 25-35 yards downfield. \nHe can stack a defender within the first 8-12 yards of the line of scrimmage.  \n\n \n174 \nNash can hold off a safety for about 30 yards before caught from behind.  \nRoute Stems: Nash widens his stems off the line against inside shade zone coverage that’s shallow. He’ll set the defender \nup with a stick to the inside before continuing outside. The stick could use more suddenness.  \nRoute Setups: When a defender playing off-coverage turns his hips downfield to run, Nash has changed pace and dipped a \nstep inside to bait the defender into slowing down. Nash then takes the defender’s back and delivers a wipe as he gets past. \nThis is a good manipulation of leverage.  \nNash uses a peek at the top of stems to set up breaks inside against tight coverage. He’ll also show his eyes inside to \nprecede a significant pace change against off coverage to set up the fade.  \nNash has the potential for a good stair-step technique when running stems, but I didn’t see him hold the vertical part of the \nstem long enough to consider him performing it effectively.  \nRoute Breaks: When running a speed out with a stem longer than five yards, Nash must develop a longer break step and a \nsharper drive step. His line step is flat. The same is true for all of these facets of his breaks when running an in-cut. He gets \ncut off on in-cuts from trailing defensive backs playing tight to him.  \nWhen running a shallow speed out with a stem five yards and shorter, his break step has length and his drive and line steps \nare flat.  \nNash’s weight drop into a whip route is sudden and he explodes out of his break. He drops his weight into a false \nacceleration break. He also has a sudden weight drop with a pop and drop.  \nZone Routes: Nash identifies the zone triangle and the second-level defender. He works to depth and settles into the open \narea, creating a friendly target. When working a vertical break through a zone, he tempos the break and waits to show his \neyes until he has passed the buzz defender. He also tempos breaks well in tight zones he’s working across underneath.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target and his quarterback breaks the pocket, Nash works to the next open zone.  \nRoute Boundary: Nash will tap and drag the back foot on timing routes at the boundary. Nash executes fades from the \nslot with a gradual fading to the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Nash tracks short out-breaking routes over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Nash must work on attacking the ball at the earliest window. He allows targets into his frame with \nunderhand position when they are behind his break and at the beltline. He clap-attacks these targets.  \nHe attacks with overhand position when facing targets arriving at the chest. He’ll extend wide of his frame with overhand \nposition for targets below his waist while breaking toward the boundary. He can also catch targets behind his break path.  \nNash has an excellent high-point and can stretch directly over the top and behind his frame to snare the ball, retract it to \nhis frame, and embrace the fall. He must use the jump up and through more often. There are scenarios where he leaves his \nfeet but uses underhand position near his waist.  \nNash can extend low and away to dig out a low throw. He’ll also catch targets in stride below his knees.  \nNash uses the attack appropriate to the trajectory of the target. Although he didn’t do it with every target, Nash attacked \nthe ball at the earliest point when he could use overhand position or if an oncoming defender might jump the route and \nNash had to use underhand attack.  \nPosition: Nash will turn back to the quarterback and the ball on fades against tight coverage to initiate a jump up and \nthrough in a timely manner, and he can draw pass interference doing so. He embraces the fall well. His jump up and \nthrough is consistently timely. He must work on keeping his hands together as he brings them up so he doesn’t clap-attack \non the high-point. This can be difficult when working the hands around the body of coverage.  \nFocus: Nash catches slants with a defender wrapped around his back and a safety hitting him in the chest. He can extend \nlow and away into oncoming contact for the ball. He can take a hard shot to the back and maintain possession of the ball.  \nNash executes an effective pull back to avoid an oncoming defender trying to play through the catch point.  \n\n \n175 \nTransitions: Nash will catch and pierce and obey the direction of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Nash spins through wraps. He has a tight spin. He has a jump cut to back away from pursuit arriving inside or \nover the top. He can layer these moves in succession.  \nNash only needs two quick steps to decelerate to a stop and cut against the grain of inside pursuit in the open field.  \nNash kicks his heel up to his backside to avoid low shots.  \nVision: Nash is prone to bounce the ball run outside when there’s an open crease up the middle but 1-2 defenders \nunblocked at the other end. He can create against unblocked defenders and displays patience with setting up pursuit in the \nopen field.  \nPower: Nash pulls through cornerbacks wrapping his torso. He has an effective stiff arm to ward off shake off contact. He \ncould duck under wraps and reach attempts at or above his chest.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Nash can bounce off a safety’s hit to his frame. \nBall Security: Nash carries the ball high to his chest, but loose at the elbow. He has lost the ball thanks to backside pursuit \npunching it loose. After that game in early 2024, Nash tightens his elbow as he encounters traffic and has taken multiple \nshots to his ball carrying arm and maintained possession.  \nNash can use his left arm but he defaults enough to his right arm that it’s not something he does enough.  \nBlocking: Nash overextends into Man Over Me assignments. However, he earns a square stance at the defender’s inside \nshoulder, underhooks the defender, and moves his feet to turn the defender away from the path to the ball. \nNash can come in too hot with his overextensions into Man Over Me assignments. He earns position and a push, but the \noverextension can allow a defender to redirect and shed. He’ll also get square but change his angle of attack at the last \nsecond when facing a linebacker and he renders himself minimally effective, at best.  \nHis arms can be too straight on stalk blocks and this helps defensive backs shed him.  \nNash will tilt into the defender he has run off and earn a square position. He also runs his feet.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Consider Nash a late-round pick or springtime waiver-wire selection for expanded off-\nseason rosters. It’s unlikely Nash ever become a teams’ receiving leader, but he could emerge as a productive second or \nthird option on his team and deliver WR2-WR4 value.   \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSwat, Flat Line Step, Snap with Break, Track over Shoulder, Boundary \n• \nPatient But Sudden Double Up and Explosive in and Out of Weight Drop \n• \nSlant vs. Contact and Release and Catch on Fade \n• \nPost, High-Point-Retraction-Embrace the Fall, TD \n• \nJump Up and Through Clap-Attack at High-point \n• \nJump Up and Through Tight Coverage, Pull-Back, Embrace Fall, Boundary \n• \nJump Up and Through While Wrapped, Pull-Back, Hit in Chest, Boundary \n• \nWorks Open in End Zone, High-Point with DB on Chest, Boundary \n• \nCatch below Knees in Strike on Slant \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n\n \n176 \nWR Antwane “Juice” Wells Jr. RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR29 \nJersey: No. 3 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/201 School: South Carolina \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Puka Nacua – Marty Booker - X - - Jalen Brooks \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 82.1 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \nOpp \nArk '22 \nTAMU '22 \nUT '22 \nUGA '23 \nOverall \nRec \n8 \n3 \n12 \n2 \n25 \nYds \n189 \n37 \n172 \n32 \n430 \nTds \n1 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n2 \nPinpoint (PP) Targets \n6 \n2 \n4 \n1 \n13 \nPinpoint (PP) Caught \n6 \n2 \n4 \n1 \n13 \nPinpoint (PP) Dropped \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nPinpoint % \n100% \n100% \n100% \n100% \n100% \nGeneral (G) Targets \n  \n  \n3 \n1 \n4 \nGeneral (G) Caught \n  \n  \n3 \n1 \n4 \nGeneral (G) Dropped \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nGeneral % \n#DIV/0! \n#DIV/0! \n100% \n100% \n100% \nPP Targets vs Contact \n2 \n1 \n4 \n  \n7 \nPP Caught vs Contact \n2 \n1 \n3 \n  \n6 \nPP Dropped vs Contact \n  \n  \n1 \n  \n1 \nPP vs Contact % \n100% \n100% \n75% \n#DIV/0! \n86% \nG Targets vs Contact \n  \n  \n3 \n  \n3 \nG Caught vs Contact \n  \n  \n2 \n  \n2 \nG Dropped vs. Contact \n  \n  \n1 \n  \n1 \nG vs. Contact % \n#DIV/0! \n#DIV/0! \n67% \n#DIV/0! \n67% \nTight Coverage Targets \n1 \n1 \n4 \n  \n6 \nTight Coverage Caught \n1 \n1 \n3 \n  \n5 \nTight Coverage Dropped \n  \n  \n1 \n  \n1 \nTight Coverage % \n100% \n100% \n75% \n#DIV/0! \n83% \nMiss-Tracked Targets \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nRoute Mix-up \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nJuggled \n  \n  \n  \n  \n0 \nDifficult \n1 \n1 \n1 \n  \n3 \n \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Puka Nacua is a multidimensional receiving threat who can run a lot of different routes against man \nand zone coverage, win contested catches, and gain yardage with his legs. He sits at the top of Antwane Wells’ stylistic \narchetype.  \n \nWells is not a multidimensional receiving threat who wins big against man coverage at this time – and that’s a major \ndifference between him and Nacua. Still, there’s a place for Wells in the NFL, as-is.  \n \n\n \n177 \nWells is skilled after the catch and has a wealth of experience running routes across the field against zone coverage, outlet \npasses to the flats, and screens at the boundary. Think of Wells as a more rugged Van Jefferson in the Rams’ system, \nrunning through wide-open zones and earning intermediate and deep targets on long-developing, play-action passes. As a \nbonus, you also get the RPO and screen game.  \n \nWells has a reasonable floor as a contributor in this respect, especially when factoring in his work in the return game. Wells \nhas a reasonable chance to make an NFL roster or practice squad.  \n \nOnce he sticks, Wells should devote more time to his man-to-man route-running. He must add more to his toolbox and \ndevelop as much or more artistry and nuance as he demonstrates with existing skills.  \n \nWells is a sound pass-catcher with the exception of isolated gaffes with clap-attacks that often come from being unsure \nabout the type of attack to use based on the trajectory of the ball. This doesn’t happen often.  \n \nAs long as Wells puts the work in, he could have a long career as a special teams ace with situational value as a receiver. \nHe lacks the explosive athletic ability to become a high-end starter, but with work, he can become a reliable contributor.  \n \nReleases: Wells uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest uncrossed at \nthe top of his front knee.  \nWells sinks into his stance at the snap and releases with his pads over his knees, his head and eyes up, and selling the \nvertical route with no wasted motion as he comes off the line, rolling off his front foot.  \nWells uses a hip shift at the top of his stem against off coverage playing over the top of him on a vertical route or an \nintermediate-breaking route across the field.  \nWells uses a wipe to counter the hands of the defender at the top of stems.  \nWell uses a stick to attack inside shade at the line of scrimmage and delivers it with suddenness to set up an outside \nrelease.  \nWells’ quick-two has a patient, but sudden quality to the movement. He’ll counter with a wipe. He uses this combination to \nsteal a release in the run game. He’ll also use a double-up to steal a release.  \nHe’ll precede the quick-two with a hesitation when a defender his playing over the top. He uses a shed at the top of stems \nagainst off coverage on vertical routes.  \nSeparation: Wells has notable acceleration after the catch, but his long speed is at the bottom range of adequate for a \nstarting NFL receiver—probably best for a slot player. When he earns 1-2 steps of separation on a fade, go, or seam route, \nWells doesn’t stack when the opportunity to do so is a good idea.  \nRoute Stems: Wells will widen against inside shade early off the line and then attack the defender’s inside alignment with a \nstick or dip before working outside of the defender at the top of the stem on the fade. He’ll dive inside outside shade late in \na stem on an intermediate route.  \nRoute Setups: Wells can do more to sell the out-and-up. He doesn’t flatten the out enough and there’s not enough snap to \nhis turns on either the out or the up. The route doesn’t sell a sense of urgency that indicates the ball is coming.  \nHis stutter-n-go needs more exaggeration at the initial break point—more bend at the knees.  \nWells uses an inset effectively with a stair-step inside-out against off coverage playing inside shade.  \nRoute Breaks: When running a vertical route, Wells will work back to the quarterback once he sees the passer break the \npocket.  \nHe has a one-long, three-quick break but must cultivate more weight drop for a sudden break. He has shown he can \nexecute it with sharpness on intermediate curls. \nWith short in-cuts, Wells delivers a sharp line step but uses two small steps for his break/drive and they aren’t sharp/flat \nenough for a tight, efficient turn.  \n\n \n178 \nWells can drop his weight into breaks. He has flat drive and line steps, but has enough lapses with the drive step against \nman-to-man coverage that he needs to continue working at it.  \nZone Routes: Wells identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and when he’s working across the field, he \ndoesn’t turn his head to the quarterback until he clears the buzz defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Wells turns through the high-point catch and gets both feet inbounds and a knee. He’ll also drag his feet \nwhen laying out for a ball wide of the boundary. \nPass Tracking: Wells leaves his feet unnecessarily with short and intermediate targets on in-breaking routes at helmet \nlevel. He has “late hands” on vertical routes and back-shoulder plays. He leaves his feet, kicking his feet backward even \nwhen he could extend his arms to the ball without leaving his feet. This limits his potential after the catch. He doesn’t leave \nhis feet unnecessarily with shallow routes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Wells can catch the ball with overhand position away from his chest at shoulder or numbers height. \nHe catches targets below the knees from a standing position. He can use overhand or underhand position. He can high-point \ndirectly above his head or slightly behind his break path.  \nWells can also extend fully for the ball wide from his frame. He’ll attack targets in open field arriving at this chest with his \narms away from his frame at the earliest window.  \nHe can extend underhand to catch a target arriving below his knees while on the move.  \nWell has lapses where he clap-traps targets to his chest with underhand position when he could catch overhand or \nunderhand without the trap.  \nPosition: When he high-points, he can take contact to his chest and the ball and turn through the contact to pull the ball \naway from the defender. He will embrace the fall when extending wide for the ball and falling to the ground.  \nFocus: Wells can take a hard hit to his back while catching a target with overhand position. He can win targets with a \ndefender getting his hands on the ball or Wells’ chest.  \nTransitions: Wells will catch and pierce.  \nElusiveness: He’ll use a stick or a stick-and-spin combination to work past pursuit over the top of him. He only needs two \nquick steps at the boundary to transition from a sideline approach to a downhill approach on a perimeter run.  \nWells can make short jump cuts away from backside pursuit that overruns its angle when Wells comes to a two-step stop.  \nHe also has sharp curvilinear bend to undercut defenders in the open field. Wells adjusts his stride length well and has \neffective stop-start footwork. He’s a good screen-RPO receiver.  \nVision: Wells understands when to undercut pursuit or split it in the open field. He sets up blocks effectively on screens, \ndisplaying the patience to press well away from the crease in traffic and then access the cutback.  \nWells wins against blocked and unblocked defenders because he’s efficient and intelligent with how he creates space and \nangles.  \nPower: He can pull through lower-body wraps. He has a capable stiff-arm to ward off reaches. He kicks his feet up to his \nbackside when a defender reaches or wraps his legs and this helps him work through the contact. He uses high knees and \nfeet to work through traffic shooting for his lower legs.  \nDirect Contact Balance:  Wells can stalemate a linebacker when Wells has the momentum into the collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Wells can bounce off glancing shots to his frame from cornerbacks. He can take a hard shot to \nhis inner thigh and hip from a linebacker and maintain his footing.  \nBall Security: He carries the ball high to his chest and can take a hard shot onto the ball. He uses the appropriate arm \naway from the nearest pursuit.  \nBlocking: Wells earns a square and squat stance, shuffling his feet as he approaches the defender. When turning into a \ndefender as a blocker transitioning from a route, Wells will earn a chest-to-chest position before delivering a shot with his \n\n \n179 \nhands tight and elbows bent—aiming for the chest of the opponent. He moves his feet well when sealing a defender outside \nor inside on a perimeter run or when he’s working downfield in the open field on a stalk block.  \nHe’s aggressive with his punch when facing Most Dangerous Man assignments. He shoots his hands with a jab, not an \nuppercut.  \nWells understands how to use Tilt Technique to run off the defender and then turn into the opponent and maintain leverage.  \nDurability: A foot injury limited Wells as a senior, but he played in all games in 2020, 2021, and 2022 with James Madison \nand South Carolina.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Wells might have value for a fantasy GM if the league includes return yardage. Otherwise, \nWells is, at best, an injury-substitute for a team who can have some good weeks based on matchups.  \n \nHe’s a high-floor/low-ceiling option you can rotate on and off the waiver wire.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nJuice Wells Twitter: Leaving Feet Unnecessarily/Tracking \n• \nHighpoint vs tight coverage \n• \nAntwane Wells 2022 Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n180",
        "analysis": "**Nick Nash (WR):**\n\n* **Strengths:** Excellent route runner with sharp short-area quickness and change of direction.  Impressive release package with a variety of maneuvers to beat defenders at the line.  Good hands, particularly in contested situations.  Strong high-pointing ability.  Versatile, able to play both inside and outside. Shows good understanding of route concepts and leverage.  Durable.\n* **Opportunities:** Improve long speed to consistently beat press coverage deep.  Attack targets earlier and avoid \"clap-attacking.\" Refine route breaks for sharper turns and more consistent separation.  Develop stair-step technique more consistently.  Improve ball security by tightening elbow when carrying.  Clean up overextension in blocking.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Michael Wilson (X), Grant DuBose, Damon Hazelton.  This suggests a player who might excel in a specific role rather than becoming a true WR1.\n\n\n**Antwane \"Juice\" Wells Jr. (WR):**\n\n* **Strengths:** Skilled after the catch.  Experienced running routes against zone coverage, excels in RPO and screen game.  Sound pass catcher, though occasional clap-attacks need correction.  Good vision and elusiveness after the catch.  Effective at setting up blocks on screens. Strong in indirect contact situations.  Solid blocker with good technique. Durable.\n* **Opportunities:** Improve man-to-man route running significantly. Add more artistry and nuance to route running.  Correct tendency to leave feet unnecessarily when catching.  Improve consistency in break steps on routes.  Develop more explosiveness and ability to stack defenders for better separation.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Puka Nacua, Marty Booker, Jalen Brooks.  This points to a player who will likely be a valuable role player, perhaps specializing in specific situations.  The comparison to Van Jefferson suggests a player who can be productive in an open offense with a good QB.\n\n**Summary Comparison:**\n\nBoth Nash and Wells project as rotational starters with the potential for more depending on development and scheme fit.  Nash's strengths lean more towards route running and contested catches while Wells excels in the after-catch and screen game.  Nash's ceiling might be slightly higher if he addresses his speed concerns, while Wells' floor is arguably safer due to his special teams value and screen game proficiency.  Both will likely be drafted late and need time to develop into consistent contributors.\n"

We’re not in that dimension.  \n \nAt best, if you’re feeling mean, you could call Lacy “Sloppy Hopkins,” and you might get a sense of where his game is. Lacy \nhas a lot of the tools you want to see from a route runner and pass catcher, but there are a lot of little things for him to \nclean up or to add to his game if he’s going to become a contributor.  \n \n\n \n181 \nRight now, Lacy has too many reps where he looks like he’s sleep-walking through routes due to lackluster pacing, \ntelegraphing breaks, and getting pinned to the boundary on perimeter routes. This can work against a lot of college \ndefenders, but it won’t be as successful on Sundays.  \n \nEven when Lacy’s game is fully awake, the speed isn’t there for him to consistently separate in the vertical and deep ranges \nof the field – routes extending beyond 30 yards. He must take every opportunity to stack defenders on the infrequent \noccasions he earns position.  \n \nThere’s a lot of criticism packed into what’s supposed to be an elevator pitch for Lacy’s potential value to an organization. \nThe positive underside to what I shared is that most of Lacy’s game is “almost there,” for him to become a good route \nrunner and pass-catcher.  \n \nLacy is a capable receiver who can get better if he works on his positioning before the catch point so he can box out \ndefenders before he attacks the ball.  \n \nIf Lacy is dedicated to his craft, he could emerge as a Noah Brown type—a possession receiver who can do the dirty work \nover the middle in zone coverage. Lacy has more explosion as an athlete, but I didn’t see evidence it was enough for him to \nbecome a future starter unless his entire game is razor-sharp.  \n \nDo they make WR strops?  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Lacy sees a lot of time as a split end in this offense, but his speed—unless he times a lot \nbetter than what I see on the field – is best-suited for a flanker or inside option in multiple receiver sets.  \nPhysical: Lacy has better quickness than he displays when running stems and executing breaks. The quickness shows up \nwith specific release footwork off the line. If he can work with greater suddenness in all phases of his route running, he’d \ngenerate better results.  \nTechnical: Lacy tips off breaks on timing routes against tight coverage when he raises his pads too early during his stems \nand doesn’t use an elongated break step to decelerate with greater suddenness. Attacking the stem at full speed and doing \nthese two things would make a big difference with is routes against man-to-man.  \nReleases: Lacy has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee.  \nWhen he begins his release, Lacy sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot. He’s prone to rocking off his back foot \nbefore he rolls off the front foot. However, he has reps where he sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without \nwasted motion.  \nLacy gets his pads over his knees and his arms move at about two-thirds the range of motion you want to see with a \nsprinter’s gait off the line.  \nLacy uses a hesitation to steal a release in the running game. He also uses a feet-switch or double up that’s sudden. He will \nuse hip shift to steal a release, but the movement lacks craft with pacing. He has a nice hesitation that’s patient with a \nmore sudden stick. He can still be more explosive with the stick.  \nLacy also uses a two-quick with a wipe counter to steal a release. Once again, there is no artistry with patience/suddenness \nto the pacing. He has a swat-swim counter with the two-quick.  \nLacy uses a read step at the top of short stems to set up out-breaking routes. He uses a pair of two-quick releases against \nshallow off-man to set up the corner fade in the red zone. Lacy combines a read step with a double up to set up a fade, but \nthe pacing has zero artistry.  \nWhen running out-breaking routes from the slot, Lacy uses a double up with a wipe counter. When playing outside, he’ll use \na read step to attack outside leverage and counter the defender’s hands with a shoulder reduction.  \nLacy has a blade release – shoulder reduction paired with a shed – but must be more selective about where to use it. The \nmove won’t help him get unpinned from the boundary when he has widened his stem as far as he does to attack outside \nleverage.  \n\n \n182 \nWhen pressed tight at the line and anticipating a jam attempt, Lacy will reduce the shoulder and swat counter the hands \nbefore taking the back of the defender.  \nLacy pairs a two-quick release against off-coverage playing outside shade to get inside. He counters the defender’s hands \nwith a wipe. He’ll also use a hip shift with a wipe counter to work outside a safety playing off him.  \nLacy has a savvy read step and two-quick combo working inside-out against outside leverage, but the pacing must be there \nfor a refined release.  \nLacy pairs a double up to attack outside leverage and counters with a swat of the inside arm against the outside defender—\ninefficient movement here.  \nLacy has a three-step release to get inside on the slant. He can deliver it with greater artistry of pacing.  \nSeparation: Lacy can defeat an off-coverage safety in the vertical and deep ranges of the field. He can earn half a step to a \nfull step on a cornerback while running a fade in the deep vertical range of the field (35-40 yards from the line of \nscrimmage). Lacy won’t beat corners playing off-man in the vertical and deep ranges of the field (35-43+ yards) without a \nsignificant manipulation tactic that can force the defender out of position.  \nLacy doesn’t run a lot of routes where he has an opportunity to stack. When he does, he either doesn’t earn the separation \nor he doesn’t try.  \nRoute Stems: Lacy dives inside defenders playing off him with inside shade. He widens against outside shade. Lacy will \nalso run at the defender to set up breaks.  \nLacy gets forced out or runs himself out of bounds on a lot of routes up the boundary. It has happened at least once in \nevery game I’ve studied of him.  \nRoute Setups: Lacy takes the back of the off-coverage defender when it’s given to him. He’ll do this late in vertical stems  \nas well as with routes that will break back to the quarterback. Lacy uses a stair-step to set up off-coverage but too often, \nthe pacing of his routes is too slow for the stair-step to be effective.  \nEven when Lacy use a brief two-step hesitation as a pace change mid-stem, there’s no dramatic change of pace. Lacy is too \ndeliberate with his route pacing. It feels as if he’s sleepwalking through many of his routes or he’s playing with an injury \nthat isn’t publicly known.  \nWith an intermediate out route, Lacy will set up the off-coverage safety with an inset. He delivers the turn of the head \ninside with good timing and duration. He can do more with body lean and movement to sell the in-breaker.  \nLacy also delivers a timing peek to the boundary to sell the fade against off-coverage. He has moved safeties to the outside \nwith the tactic.  \nRoute Breaks: Lacy has a quick pop and drop break for short hitches and curls. He squares the target with friendly position \nto the quarterback out of the break. Lacy also has a three-step break and he transitions into a flat drive step and flat line \nstep when breaking outside. He gets his head around fast and presents a friendly target. Neither break has enough weight \ndrop for sudden deceleration.  \nWhen Lacy uses weight drop into a three-step break, he also uses an elongated break step. The break step can be longer \nand he doesn’t attack the top of the stem at even three-quarters speed.  \nWhen Lacy faces tight coverage on a curl, he’ll deliver good weight drop with his drop and pop break and the break is \nsudden. He’ll work back to the quarterback. When facing tight coverage, Lacy will also deliver snap to his breaks back to the \nquarterback, punching the boundary arm to generate an explosive turn.  \nLacy also works back to the ball out of his break on out routes.  \nHe doesn’t get enough separation on drop and pop breaks back to the QB against tight coverage when he doesn’t drop his \nweight into the move.  \nWhen Lacy’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work to an open space.  \n\n \n183 \nZone Routes: Lacy identifies the second and third-level defenders in Cover 2, works to depth, and paces his break through \nthe open area while giving his quarterback a friendly target.  \nLacy has a good feel for the zone triangle and settles into the open area on underneath routes.  \nRoute Boundary: Lacy can high-point the ball away from his frame and tap one foot in bounds. He can tap and drag in \nbounds with a defender tight after high-pointing the ball.  \nPass Tracking: Lacy leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets above his head. It costs him a step or two as a runner on \nshallow targets. It also costs him against tight coverage at the boundary where a push sends him out of bounds and a catch \nwith his feet on the ground wouldn’t.  \nLacy tracks the ball over his shoulder and can attack with overhand position against tight coverage.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lacy extends his arms to the ball with overhand position when targets arrive at his chest. He can \nhigh-point the football. He can catch targets wide of his frame over his shoulder. He earns low and away targets near the \nboundary with diving extensions for the ball.  \nPosition: Lacy has an effective pull back against tight coverage after high-pointing the ball near the boundary or pulling the \nball away from a defender reaching for his chest on an out-breaking route. He embraces the fall when making full \nextensions to lay out for the ball.  \nLacy must develop the ability to identify and time opportunities to jump up and through against defenders on corner fades. \nThis involves tracking and timing that could prove a difficult area to develop at this point in his career. He does a much \nbetter job on deep fades at the boundary.  \nFocus: Lacy can take a hit to his back while extending for the ball on a target above his head. He can secure the ball as a \ndefender reaches into his chest to pluck it out. He earns targets against tight coverage on timing routes when the ball leads \nhim with his break path.  \nLacy can take a hard shot to the chest and get ping-ponged into a safety delivering a hit to Lacy’s back in succession with \nthe initial hit.   \nTransitions: Lacy obeys the flight of the ball to dictate the direction he catches and pierces downhill. \nElusiveness: Lacy ducks under defenders when spinning away from them to work downhill. His spin is tight. He hasn’t \nshown dynamic lateral movement or creativity with footwork as an open field runner or between the tackles.  \nLacy only needs two steps to transition downhill on a boundary path to the short flat or numbers.  \nVision: Lacy works to open space. He presses creases against unblocked defenders to set up cutbacks or bounces away \nfrom them. He’s patient about setting up blocks in the open field and creating creases against unblocked defenders. \nPower: Lacy keeps his feet moving after contact. He can run through reaches to his lower legs and frame—multiple reaches \nduring the same run. He uses a stiff arm to swat away the reach of a defender after setting them up with a stutter.  \nLacy will take a defensive back for a short ride if wrapped high and Lacy has momentum downhill. He can carry a defensive \nback 4-6 yards downfield.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Lacy can stalemate a hit from a cornerback in the open field when the defender has the \nmomentum into the collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Lacy has a capable balance-touch after contact.  \nBall Security: Lacy tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm. He tucks the ball close to his chest, but his elbow is loose \nfrom his side.  \nBlocking: Lacy gets his hands inside the shoulders of corners on Man Over Me assignments. He moves his feet with \nurgency to deliver a push. He overextends and locks out his arms just enough that he gets rag-dolled/shed easily when the \ndefensive back is in a good stance. If not, Lacy’s hand position and footwork can drive the defender off the ball for 5-7 \nyards.  \n\n \n184 \nWhen delivering Most Dangerous Man blocks, Lacy earns a square and squat position with a wide stance. He shuffles his \nfeet well enough to move laterally in a balanced position. He can also peel off the safety and slide to the corner and earn \nsimilar position to sustain that block downfield.  \nLacy also works tight into the chest of linebackers on Most Dangerous Man assignments. He can eliminate the gap between \nthem and generate a push, turning the defender outside.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Pre-NFL Draft, monitor from afar. If Lacy earns NFL Draft capital, consider him a late-\nround pick or free agent for expanded rosters during the summer.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHighpoint, Pullback, Boundary \n• \nTempos Zone Break, Early-Window Attack, Overhand Attack at Frame \n• \nTwo-Quick/Double Up Release Combo – Needs Craft/Artistry with Pacing \n• \nTipping off Break and Lacking Deceleration \n• \nNot Tipping off Break and Full Speed Attack of Stem \n• \nPatience and Suddenness with the Double Up \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n185",
        "analysis": "Kyren Lacy is a WR prospect with a high ceiling but significant refinement needed.  His size (6'2\", 213 lbs) and athleticism give him the potential to be a productive NFL receiver, but inconsistency and technical flaws currently limit his upside.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:**  Possesses good size and can high-point the ball, making contested catches.  He shows the ability to make catches outside his frame and extend for low balls.\n* **Route Running (Potential):**  Displays flashes of excellent route running technique, particularly with releases and some breaks.  He has a diverse set of release moves.  \n* **After the Catch:** Shows decent power after the catch, breaking tackles and running through arm tackles.  He possesses above average balance and can maintain his feet through contact.\n* **Blocking:**  Shows potential as a blocker, especially in man coverage situations.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Route Running Consistency:**  Lacy's biggest weakness is his inconsistent route running. He often telegraphs his breaks, lacks sufficient deceleration, and gets pinned to the boundary. Improving his pacing and suddenness would dramatically enhance his effectiveness.\n* **Increase Speed and Separation:** While possessing good quickness, Lacy lacks elite speed to consistently create separation deep downfield.  He needs to utilize his size more effectively to box out defenders and win at the catch point.\n* **Refine Technique:** Lacy needs to improve his overall technical skills, including his hand placement, weight distribution during releases, and consistency in his breaks.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report itself lists Keon Coleman, Noah Brown, Sage Surratt, and even (with caveats) DeAndre Hopkins as comparison points.  However, a more realistic assessment would place him closer to **Noah Brown** as a potential outcome: a possession receiver who wins with size and physicality over the middle, but lacks elite speed and separation skills to be a true WR1.  The \"Sloppy Hopkins\" comparison highlights his potential but emphasizes the need for significant improvement in consistency and technical refinement.  If he fails to improve his consistency, he may not even reach that level.  The comparison to Keon Coleman suggests similar size and athleticism, but Coleman seems to be further along in terms of polished skillset.\n"

His hands rest at \neither side of his front knee.  \nWhen he begins his release, Lambert-Smith sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. His pads \nare over his knees and his head is up and forward.  \nLambert-Smith counters the hands of an inside shade defender with a violent shed.

He counters with either a wipe or a shoulder \nreduction.  \nHe has a foot-switch to work inside tight man-to-man coverage at the line. He’ll use a wipe as his counter to the defender’s \nhand.  \nHe also has a read step. He uses a wipe counter to the read step. Lambert-Smith uses a hesitation or a double up against \noff-coverage. He uses the double up or two-quick to steal a release. He’ll also use a read step and two-quick as a \ncombination for stealing a release.  \nLambert-Smith uses a hesitation to set up an outside release. He’ll counter the defender’s hands with a shoulder reduction.  \nLambert-Smith has a good swat-swim. He also executes a stick and double swat to get outside a defender on a sail route.  \nMost of Lambert-Smith’s releases lack the artistry of pace variation. There’s no contrast between patience and suddenness. \nHis read step has patience and suddenness and a violent wipe counter when releasing outside against press coverage. His \ndouble up with wipe counter has some patience and suddenness but could use more.  \nSeparation: Lambert-Smith will stack a defender within the first 10-15 yards of the line of scrimmage. \nRoute Stems: Lambert-Smith will run at the defender and into his toes to set up a break away from the defender. He’ll \nwiden his stems against outside-shade coverage. He’ll also dive inside against inside shade.  \nRoute Setups: Lambert-Smith uses a stair-step to set up zone coverage. He uses this technique with routes that break \ninside or outside.  \nHe’ll take the back of the defender at the top of his stem. He’ll deliver an inset at the top of his stem.  \nRoute Breaks: Lambert-Smith has a three-step break with a tight turn and flip of the hips to face the quarterback with his \nbreak. There are breaks of this type where he will hop toward the quarterback, but he can do better and has done better \nbreaking back to the ball. His breaks would improve if he extended the break step longer and had more weight drop.  \nLambert-Smith has a long break step into his drop and pop break.  \nWhen Lambert-Smith’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to the open area. He has effective weight drop into his \nthree-step break in the intermediate range of the field.  \nWhen running intermediate three-step breaks, he can need four-five break steps.  \nLambert-Smith executes shallow speed breaks with a sharp drive step and line step. He gets his head around to the \nquarterback. There is no snap with the turn. He must learn to punch the boundary-side arm when running routes that aren’t \nduring running plays.  \nLambert-Smith had two route breaks that were questionable at game’s end against Cal. One was a mix up between him and \nhis quarterback in the end zone with 6:15 left on 3rd and 7 and the result was an interception. Then on the final play for \ntheir offense with 0:28 left, Lambert Smith continued straight when the QB threw the post.  \nZone Routes: Lambert-Smith identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break across the open \nzone. He doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender.  \n\n \n187 \nLambert-Smith identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly target.  \nRoute Boundary: Lambert-Smith can drag his feet at the boundary while leaning across the sideline to fully extend for the \ntarget. He’ll also toe tap both feet inbounds. \nPass Tracking: Lambert-Smith can track the ball over his shoulder with one outstretched hand. He keeps his feet on the \nground and only leaves his feet when necessary.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lambert-Smith can extend fully to the football with overhand position and retract it to his frame. He \ncan also fully extend near the boundary with underhand position.  \nHe can be prone to clap-attacking overhand attack at the numbers.  \nLambert-Smith can attack targets at the earliest point of arrival when they arrive at his numbers. He can also high-point \nhitches and curls.  \nPosition: Lambert-Smith will embrace the fall when extending away for the ball.  \nFocus: Lambert-Smith can extend away from his frame with overhand attack and take a wrap to his back while securing \nthe ball. He can do the same with an underhand attack. He can take a hard shot to his back while tracking and catching the \nball over his shoulder. \nTransitions: Lambert-Smith obeys the ball and catches and pierces based on the location of the ball. When there’s no \nindication to obey the ball, Lambert-Smith can improve his identification of the coverage around him to determine the \ndirection of his transitions.   \nElusiveness: Lambert-Smith can jump-cut away from some pursuit over the top. He’ll use stutters to set up a dip away \nfrom contact. He can spin through reaches. He can transition downhill with 2-3 quick steps. \nVision: He identifies unanticipated obstacles in close proximity and finds quick solutions. He’s decisive and has a good feel \nfor open space as well as finding open space in traffic. He must prove he can press creases to set up bounces and cutbacks. \nHe drops his pads and barrels into blocked defender to finish runs where he can work to an open crease. \nPower: Lambert-Smith can ward off reaches to his frame with a stiff-arm. He also ducks through reaches and pulls through \nmultiple reach attempts as a ball carrier in the open field.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Lambert-Smith bounces off glancing shots to his pads, hips, and legs from safeties.  \nBall Security: Lambert-Smith has lapses where he carries the ball low and away from his frame in the open field. He \ncarries it higher to his chest when he knows he’s near a defender. Lambert-Smith uses the boundary-side arm to carry the \nball. He can take contact to the ball when he keeps the ball high to his chest.  \nBlocking: Lambert-Smith earns a squat and square position to the outside shoulder of the outside linebacker on Man Over \nMe assignments. Lambert-Smith shuffles his feet with a wide and squat stance to move laterally with a defender.  \nHe can anchor against contact, earn position with his hands to turn the defender, and use a one-arm technique to move his \nfeet and keep the man wide of the ball carrier. \nLambert-Smith will run off a defender on a route and then tilt outside to square the opponent for a block.   \nWith Most Dangerous Man assignments, Lambert-Smith is patient to stalk the defender and get his hands in position to \ndeliver them bent at the elbows. There is still some lapses where he overextends a slight amount or doesn’t earn the correct \nshoulder.  \nLambert-Smith is prone to overreacting to defender redirects and giving up the counter move off that redirect.  \nDurability: No significant injuries at Auburn or Penn State.  \n \n\n \n188 \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Relative to a player like Isaac TeSlaa who has a high ceiling as a boom-bust prospect – \nsee the next report – Lambert-Smith has a moderate ceiling. Lambert-Smith is a late-round option in leagues with at least \nseven rounds. Otherwise, monitor from afar before we learn about his NFL Draft capital. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStrong Extension away from Frame \n• \nOne-Handed Over Shoulder and Underhand Dig-Out Embrace Fall TD \n• \nStem Work on Vertical Routes \n• \nStack and Track vs. Tight Coverage  \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n189",
        "analysis": "KeAndre Lambert-Smith is a WR prospect with a moderate NFL ceiling, projected as a late-round pick.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Speed and Agility:** Possesses impressive speed, elusiveness after the catch, and the ability to make defenders miss.  He consistently generates chunk plays.\n* **Route Running:** Shows proficiency in zone coverage, creating separation and finding open areas. His route running is improving, particularly his man-to-man skills. He uses diverse release techniques and shows good route breaks although consistency needs work.\n* **Hands and Catch Radius:**  Reliable hands and a good catch radius; capable of high-pointing the ball and making difficult catches.  He shows strength in extending away from his frame.\n* **After-the-Catch Ability:**  Excellent vision and ability to navigate traffic after the catch, making him a threat to gain yards after reception.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential in run blocking, demonstrating ability to anchor and move defenders.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Man Coverage Improvement:** While improving, his man-to-man route running still needs refinement. More consistency in his releases and breaks would enhance his overall performance.\n* **Route Consistency:**  Occasional route mix-ups suggest the need for improved focus and precision in executing routes.\n* **Ball Security:**  Shows lapses in ball security at times, particularly when carrying the ball low.  Improving his ball carrying technique will reduce turnovers.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report uses a spectrum of comparisons, indicating versatility in his potential role:\n\n* **High-end:** Jaxon Smith-Njigba (suggests potential for high production, though unlikely given his ranking) and Jerry Jeudy (suggests refined route running and athleticism).\n* **Mid-range:**  Darius Slayton (most realistic comparison -  a rotational starter/reliable contributor capable of occasional big plays)\n* **Lower-end:** Jalen Tolbert and Devontez Walker (suggests a potential role as a depth player or a situational receiver).\n\n**Overall:**\n\nLambert-Smith projects as a rotational receiver who can contribute immediately with his speed and after-the-catch ability.  His ceiling hinges on improving consistency in his route running and ball security.  While he might not become a star, he has the tools to become a valuable asset to an NFL team.\n"

Blessed with height, size, speed, acceleration, \nand quickness, TeSlaa also has strong hand-eye coordination and reliable mitts.  \n \nWhat’s not to love? Plug TeSlaa into an offense with 2-3 veteran receivers and/or top tight end and he can earn mismatches \nin the intermediate and vertical game against linebackers, safeties, and nickel backs who can’t hang with TeSlaa’s physical \ndimensions and explosion.  \n \n\n \n190 \nIt worked for the Steelers and Lions with Chase Claypool and Kenny Golladay, right? Sort of… \n \nIt works temporarily. Eventually, opposing defenses make these athletic receivers the primary focus and eventually the \nproduction dips if the players don’t show more to their game than playing the NFL’s version of catch in the park.  \n \nTeSlaa could follow suit in both respects. Right now, he’s an unrefined route runner with enough tools to develop his craft \nbut capable of running crossers, over routes, sail routes, back-shoulder fades, and go routes. These are all routes where \nsize, and speed favor TeSlaa.  \n \nFor TeSlaa to capitalize on the Claypool/Golladay Production Privilege that temporarily blinds fans into thinking their team \nfound a future star, he must tighten up his positioning between himself and the defender on vertical routes near the \nboundary and address sloppiness with his attack with specific targets.  \n \nIf TeSlaa can do this, his next step will be his man-to-man route running. He has been making strides with setting up \ncoverage during his stems. His breaks require more precision and snap. \n \nTeSlaa is a good prospect if the coaching staff and organization drafting him explain to him that he’s a developmental \nprospect—regardless of him getting the Claypool/Golladay Production Privilege as a rookie. If they can drill into TeSlaa that \nearning 45-60 catches for 800-1,000 yards and 4-6 scores is not the standard to judge his development when he’s \nbenefitting from his teammates to a higher degree than others, there’s hope for him long-term.  \n \nIf not, TeSlaa will be a sell-high candidate for a team with any semblance of awareness and fantasy GMs who invested a \nmid-to-late pick.  \n \nTechnical: Although TeSlaa works out of breaks back to the ball, he drifts with his first two steps and must correct that \nbecause NFL CBs are too good at tight trail coverage to let that sloppiness work out in his favor.  \nReleases: TeSlaa had a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee. TeSlaa sinks deep into his stance without rocking off his back foot but stepping with his front foot. TeSlaa \nhas reps where he sinks into his stance and releases without wasted motion. These were the exceptions rather than the rule \nin 2023, but they became significantly more frequent in 2024.  \nTeSlaa doesn’t attack stems like he’s sprinting at full speed out of his release. His pads are over his knees but not as far as \nthey could be and his arms move at about one-third to one-half their potential range of motion.  \nTeSlaa combines a two-quick and a double up to set up an inside release. He counters the defender’s hands with a wipe. He \nuses a double up or stutter to steal a release. He can use the double up with the outside or inside foot. He combines the \ndouble up inside with a feet-switch that precedes it. He also combines a hesitation with a double up to steal a release.  \nWhile it’s the exception more than the rule, TeSlaa can deliver a double up with patience and suddenness.  \nTeSlaa combines a read step to attack outside leverage with a swat from his inside arm to get inside the coverage. He uses \na three-quick with a wipe counter at the top of a shallow stem to get inside a defender playing over the top.  \nTeSlaa reduces his shoulder from the reach of a defender playing inside leverage. He’ll often set this up with a stick at the \ntop of his stem against this off-coverage.  \nTeSlaa has a sudden swat-swim counter against outside leverage. Against off-coverage TeSlaa has a hip shift at the top of \nthe stem but the footwork needs more artistry with patience and range of motion to sell it effectively.  \nSeparation: TeSlaa has the speed to outrun man coverage and earn 1-2 steps with breaks that occur beyond 20 yards \ndownfield. If he earns 2-3 steps on a cornerback, he’ll maintain that distance for 35-50 yards after the catch. He can stack a \ndefender.  \nRoute Stems: TeSlaa will widen or dive based on the leverage of the defender. By mid-season of 2024, TeSlaa began \nhaving reps where he’d attack stems at full speed—even working into the defender’s toes at that pace and his arms moving \nat nearly full range of motion for a sprinter’s gait.  \nRoute Setups: At the boundary, TeSlaa used a peek to the sideline in 2023, but he was already so tight to the boundary \nthat the move made no sense. He’ll run at the defender and get tight into the defender’s toes at the top of his stem before \ndipping inside and delivering a wipe.  \n\n \n191 \nHe displayed a much better peek in 2024 in a two-way-go scenario to bait the safety over the top and gain excellent inside \nrelease.  \nTeSlaa will take the back of the defender on intermediate and vertical stems.  \nRoute Breaks: TeSlaa has a flat drive step and flat line step on short in-cuts. His out-breaking routes don’t have flat \nenough drive steps and line steps and the break drifts—even shallow outs.  \nTeSlaa has a long break step into a drop and pop but the weight drop isn’t sufficient for sudden deceleration. His weight \ndrop is effective when he executes the drop and pop without a break step.  \nTeSlaa also has a long break step into a three-step break. The weight drop also needs to be deeper for sudden deceleration. \nHis breaks are acceptable when defenders are a yard or two away from him, but not when they have tight coverage.  \nHe presents a friendly target and gets his head around fast.  \nTeSlaa has potential to snap his breaks with suddenness. His turn has quickness but not suddenness. He must punch the \nboundary arm to generate that snap. When tight to the defender at the top of a stem and making contact, TeSlaa will punch \nthe inside arm to generate that snap.  \nZone Routes: TeSlaa breaks across zones and waits to show his head until he earns separation from the buzz/rollover \ndefender. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to the next available open zone for his scrambling passer.  \nThere are zone routes where he breaks over the middle and doesn’t read the zone well enough to know when he should \nhave settled or continue across the field. When he recognizes it correctly, he tempos breaks well between tight windows.  \nTeSlaa doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback on vertical zone routes until he has passed the rollover/buzz defender.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary as a runner and a receiver. He’ll toe-tap both feet inbounds on sail routes \nnear the sideline.  \nPass Tracking: TeSlaa can track the ball over his back shoulder with overhand position wide from his frame. Although his \nattack is suboptimal with positioning of his hands, he attacks at the earliest window for targets on his numbers.  \nHands/Catch Radius: TeSlaa fully extends his arms wide of his frame with overhand attack. He can high-point with tight \nhands to the ball. He attacks targets on the numbers with an attack that isn’t uniform and there’s clapping.  \nPosition: TeSlaa can embrace the fall when forced to leave his feet for the ball. He can make a back-shoulder turn in tight \ncoverage to earn the ball, but instead of attacking the ball he fades away from the ball and the defender, opening himself \nup for the defender to gain access to his chest and hands.  \nFocus: TeSlaa can win a back-shoulder target with a defender tight to his inside hip and reaching for the ball. He can earn \nthe ball away from his frame with a defender tight to his back across the middle and wrapping him.  \nTransitions: TeSlaa adheres to catch and pierce principles and obeys the path of the ball.  \nElusiveness: He has a tight spin to the outside. He only needs two steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a \ndownhill runway.  \nVision: TeSlaa finds open space and has the acceleration and speed to reach it. He also knows when to drop his pads and \nsplit defenders rather than attempting to outflank them.  \nIf he has advanced vision, I didn’t see it because of the limited number of plays he had in traffic for the past two years. \nTeSlaa didn’t make many, if any bad decisions, but the types of decisions he had were limited.  \nPower: TeSlaa finishes with good pad level into collisions and continues moving his feet until pulled to the ground. He uses \na forearm shiver to ward off contact to his frame when initiating collisions directly with a defender.  \nDirect Contact Balance: TeSlaa bounces off a safety’s hit to his chest  \nIndirect Contact Balance: TeSlaa bounces off glancing shots to his side and upper legs from a safety.  \n\n \n192 \nBall Security: TeSlaa tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm and high to his chest, but loose at the elbow. He has lost \nthe ball due to a chop from backside pursuit.  \nBlocking: TeSlaa delivers with tight hands with a square position and bend with his knees with Man Over Me assignments. \nHe’s prone to overextending by dipping his head into the collision. When he doesn’t, he can get his hands inside and drive a \ndefender far from his original spot.  \nHe latches on to the chest plate effectively and is difficult for corners to dislodge. He shuffles his feet laterally.  \nAlthough his hands can be too wide and he overextends, TeSlaa has the size and strength to turn small outside linebackers \nand nickel linebackers in the run game.  \nWith Most Dangerous Man blocks, he is patient to work a flat lead toward the deep safety and then wait for the safety to \ncome to him while he slides laterally with a wide and squat stance to get square. He delivers his hands with elbows bent and \nmoves his feet to remain square.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: TeSlaa is an easy investment and later, an easy sell-high candidate if he hits early with a \nteam that creates the Golladay/Claypool Productive Privilege as outlined above. He’s a worthwhile consideration in the fifth \nround or later of most rookie drafts – lower if possible in drafts prior to the NFL Draft. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDouble Up/Swipe Combo, Strength, Potential Inset, Tracking and Speed \n• \nTwo-Quick, Pacing, Early Attack, Boundary Work \n• \nDrifting Break with Out Route, Toughness at Catch Point, Contact Balance \n• \nTwo-Way-Go, Peek, Athletic Catch, Ball Security Woes \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n193",
        "analysis": "Isaac TeSlaa is a boom-or-bust prospect with WR32 ranking.  His strengths are his impressive physical tools: 6'4\", 214 lbs with speed, acceleration, and strong hands.  He excels at high-pointing the ball and has a large catch radius.  He can effectively run routes that leverage his size and speed (crossers, over routes, fades, go routes).  His potential is reminiscent of players like Kenny Golladay and Chase Claypool.\n\nHowever, TeSlaa's weaknesses are significant.  He's an unrefined route runner with inconsistent technique, particularly in his breaks and releases. His route running needs significant improvement to consistently beat NFL-level cornerbacks. His ball security also needs work.\n\n**Opportunities:**  TeSlaa's ceiling is high if he refines his route running and improves his overall technique.  He could thrive in an offense that uses him strategically to exploit mismatches against smaller defensive backs and linebackers, similar to how Claypool and Golladay experienced early success.  Development under the right coaching staff is crucial.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Kenny Golladay and Chase Claypool are apt comparisons due to their similar size, athleticism, and initial success based on physical dominance before running into limitations.  However, TeSlaa also has a Matt Jones-like potential to be a physical mismatch, but again, his refinement will be paramount in determining which comparison holds the most weight.\n\n**Overall:**  TeSlaa is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His physical traits are undeniable, but his technical deficiencies must be addressed for him to reach his potential. He's a developmental player who could become a valuable asset if he works hard on refining his route running and consistently improves his technique.  He projects as a rotational starter if his skills develop, but if not, he could quickly become a \"sell-high\" candidate.\n"

In case, Singer doesn’t receive an extra year, I’m including him in the 2025 \nRSP.  \n \nAs you can see by his score, he’s a prospect with growth potential to become a contributor, if not a future starter. What I \nlike most about Singer’s game is his route running.  \n \n\n \n194 \nSinger is one of the few receivers in this class who has both a wide array of release moves and performs them with the \nartistry and craft that needs to happen in the NFL. Singer isn’t special route runner, but most of his work is technically \nsound and clean, and it makes it easier for Singer to add to his game when he enters the league without needing to take \nsteps backward to move forward in his development.  \n \nThe greatest concern I have for Singer’s game is catching the ball and it’s a low-level concern relative to how his game \ncharting results look. In those six games above, Singer had six targets I scored as drops.  \n \nWhat I don’t show you is that I have commentary tagged with each drop so I can consider context before I use the charting \ndata in any subsequent article or podcast. Of those six drops, three of them were difficult catches that I noted as throws I \nwould have charted as inaccurate if I were charting the quarterback.  \n \nThe other three drops were targets against tight coverage where the defender got his hands on the ball as Singer was \nmaking the catch or in one case, delivered a hard hit to jar it loose. With this context as a guide, Singer catches a lot more  \ntargets against tight coverage and hits than he drops.  \n \nIf there’s low-level concern, it’s that opposing defenders can pull the ball away from Singer and his hand strength could be \nminor problem. Otherwise, Singer uses the optimal attacks, positions himself well to the ball against coverage, and he can \nmake athletic adjustments to win targets.  \n \nSinger wins after the catch with agility and good decision-making. He’s a light receiver and that won’t change much.  \n \nIf Singer declares for the draft or is eligible for the supplemental draft, he’s a worthwhile investment who should make the \nback end of a roster and earn situational playing time as a fourth option. Because of his technical acumen, he has a good \nchance to develop into a more substantial producer.  \n \nReleases: Singer has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee.  \nHe will steal a release in the run game. He uses a one-step stretch toward the defender’s leverage and a wipe counter to \nthe defender’s hands. He also uses a hesitation and a two-quick or double-up combo.  \nSinger will combine the two-quick and double-up to steal a release. He can also combine the wipe as the counter. He has a \nthree-quick when he plays flanker against tight coverage. \nHe’ll use a two-quick and stick combination to release inside a defender.  \nSinger’s hesitation and double-swat is a nice display of patience and suddenness. Most of his moves have patience and \nsuddenness.  \nSinger has a good swat-wipe or swat-swim to counter to a defender’s hands at the line of scrimmage. He uses a stick to \nattack outside leverage on deep over routes. He counters with the wipe in this case as well. He also uses a double-up with a \nwipe counter.  \nSinger uses a one-step stretch and a two-quick as a combo off the line. He uses a two-quick and wipe counter to set up a \nslant. Singer uses a foot-switch to pivot and release inside off the line of scrimmage against tight coverage.  \nSinger also has a shed counter when releasing outside coverage.  \nThere’s good patience and suddenness with his hesitation and shoulder reduction counter to the defender’s hands when \nfacing outside shade and tight coverage at the line.  \nSinger has a violent swim off a throw by or swat-swim combination.  \nAgainst off-coverage, Singer has a sudden hip shift with a wipe counter. He also has a blade release with the shoulder \nreduction and shed counter.   \nSeparation: He’s quick enough to earn 2-3 steps on a safety one-on-one on crossing routes and a step or two on a \ncornerback playing tight coverage. Singer has smooth light-footed acceleration. He will stack defenders in intermediate \nroutes.  \n\n \n195 \nRoute Stems: Singer will run at the defender playing off-coverage. He’ll do it to set up the defender with a double-up and a \nwipe. He’ll also dive inside to attack inside shade leverage and widen outside to attack outside shade. Singer will also take \nthe back of the defender.  \nRoute Setups: He’ll set up a deep over route with a stick. He’ll take the back of a Cover 3 cornerback on a vertical route. \nSinger will stair step off-coverage with a dive inside and then flattening out to a vertical stem before breaking inside.   \nSinger will peek outside at the top of stems on vertical routes. He’ll deliver an inset at the top off a stem against off-\ncoverage of a safety over him on a deep corner route or deep flat route.   \nRoute Breaks: Singer has a three-step break with a long break step and weight drop. He breaks back to the quarterback.  \nWith speed breaks, Singer executes tight turns with snap thanks to punching the boundary-side arm. The turn is more with \nhis hips than it is flat line and drive steps. He can also execute the tight turn with a flat drive step and line step and work \nback to the quarterback.  \nWhen the first break doesn’t earn a target, Singer will work to an open area.  \nZone Routes: Singer identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across a zone. He also \nwaits to show his eyes until he crosses the rollover or buzz defender.  \nWhen working underneath zone defenders, Singer will identify the second level defender, work to depth, and settle into the \nopen area. He snaps the turn and presents a friendly target to the quarterback.  \nRoute Boundary: He drags his frame at the boundary while digging out low throws. He can toe tap on outs tight to the \nboundary.  \nPass Tracking: Singer can make a late turn with late hands on back-shoulder fades against tight coverage. He’ll track \ntargets over his head on the move without leaving his feet. He’ll also catch the ball over his shoulder.  \nHe turns behind his break path easily and snatches the ball away from his frame.  \nHands/Catch Radius: He can dig out low throws with underhand position and with his arms outstretched to do so. He’ll \nalso catch targets at his back hip behind his break path.  \nSinger can extend over his and shoulder with overhand attack above his head. He attacks high targets at helmet-height at \nthe earliest point of arrival.  \nPosition: Singer has a jump up and through technique that allows him to high-point or pull the ball away from the defender \nwith superior position to the target. He can embrace the fall after high-pointing on a jump up and through versus coverage \ncontacting his chest. Singer has an effective pull back against tight coverage.  \nFocus: Singer makes underhand catches at his numbers or helmet height away from his head with a defender wrapped \naround his back. He can take contact to his chest as he’s high-pointing the ball.  \nTransitions: Singer obeys the ball and uses catch-and-pierce principles.  \nElusiveness: Singer has a good feel for when to use a spin and he can spin through wraps to his upper body.  \nVision: Singer has a good feel for finding soft spots in traffic to earn extra yardage through contact.  \nPower: Singer keeps his feet moving through contact in the secondary and uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his \nframe. He also pulls through reaches that get to his frame. He’ll also pull through wraps to his upper body.  \nSinger drops his pads into reaches from defensive backs and forces them to slide down his frame and wrap up.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can push against glancing shots from cornerbacks \n\n \n196 \nBall Security: Singer tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm high to his chest. He can resist pulls to the ball. He can \nkeep his elbow tight to his frame when running traffic. When he doesn’t use his boundary arm, he’s prone to using his left \narm.  \nBlocking: Singer approaches Most Dangerous Man Assignments with a squat and square stance. He shuffles his feet and he \naims his hands for the opponent’s chest. He moves his feet well after contact.  \nWhen a teammate breaks through the line of scrimmage with the ball, Singer will cut off the closest DB and earn a chest-to-\nchest position and run the defender off.  \nSinger keeps defenders at arm’s length, and he only delivers contact to the defender’s chest when delivering a shoulder or \nelbow as a strike. He’ll do this with Most Dangerous Man assignments. He can get a flat lead to cut off the Most Dangerous \nMan when he’s working from a tighter split from the line. He tends to make one extra move that takes him out of position \nfor blocking the defender and I would not be surprised if it’s intentional on his part.   \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Singer is a late-round option in PPR formats in drafts with 7-9 rounds. He’s a first-call free \nagent if your drafts are less than seven rounds but you have expanded preseason rosters.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDorian Singer back-shoulder dig-out of low throw.  \n• \nRun at DB, Double Up, Wipe, Tight Speed Break Back to QB \n• \nUSC Highlights \n• \nArizona Highlights \n• \nUtah Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n197",
        "analysis": "Dorian Singer is a WR prospect with a RSP ranking of WR33, possessing a blend of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Route Running:**  Singer's most significant asset is his technically sound and varied route running. He displays a wide array of release moves (staggered stance, one-step stretch, wipe counter, hesitation, double-up combo, three-quick, stick, foot-switch, shed counter, swat-swim, hip shift, blade release) executed with artistry and craft. This allows for consistent separation, particularly against tight coverage. He excels at setting up defenders, using diverse stems, breaks (three-step break, speed breaks), and manipulating zone coverages.  He demonstrates excellent patience and suddenness in his movements.\n* **Good Catching Technique:** While his drop rate is a concern (6 drops in six tracked games), context reveals that three were difficult catches and three occurred in tight coverage, suggesting hand strength could be a minor issue.  He excels at high-pointing the ball, making athletic adjustments to win targets, digging out low throws, and securing the ball in traffic.\n* **After-the-Catch Abilities:** Singer is agile and makes smart decisions after the catch, maximizing yardage.\n* **Blocking:** He shows solid effort and technique in pass protection, particularly in \"Most Dangerous Man\" assignments.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Hand Strength/Catching Consistency:**  Addressing his occasional drops, particularly those resulting from defenders stripping the ball, is key to reaching his full potential.\n* **NFL Development:** His technical proficiency provides a strong foundation for further development in the NFL. His ability to learn and refine his skills should lead to improvement.\n* **Eligibility:** His eligibility for the NFL draft depends on a pending court ruling that could grant him an extra year of college eligibility.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Slight Frame:**  His relatively light weight (177 lbs) may be a disadvantage against stronger NFL defenders.\n* **Drop Rate:** Though context-dependent, a higher-than-ideal drop rate is a legitimate concern.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Emanuel Sanders\n\nThis comparison highlights Singer's potential as a technically proficient route runner with solid after-the-catch ability, but also acknowledges his slight frame and the need to improve his catching consistency.  Sanders was known for his route-running prowess and ability to make plays after the catch, but he also wasn't the most physically imposing receiver.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nDorian Singer projects as a rotational starter or late-round draft pick with a high ceiling.  His exceptional route running is a significant asset, but improving his ball security and adding strength are essential for him to consistently succeed at the NFL level.  He's a worthwhile investment for teams looking for a receiver with refinement and upside.\n"

This was also the case for White’s ultimate aspirational comparison, Torry Holt.  \n \nWhite has the fundamentals needed to become a strong route runner. Most of the refinement ahead for White is about \npacing, holding certain tactics longer to bait defenders, and tweaking small details that can optimize his breaks.  \nThe most important thing for White to address before August is his attack of the ball. His hands are too wide and he’s prone \nto clap-attacks.  \n \n\n \n198 \nWhile White had success as a pass-catcher in college, the NFL will require a narrower margin for error against a much \nhigher level of competition. Leaving this technical flaw unaddressed with his game exposes White to higher odds of dropping \ntargets, especially when White’s speed is pedestrian by NFL standards, and he’ll likely be attacking targets in tight coverage \nmore often.  \n \nUnless White demonstrates an obsessive work ethic to raise his game to elite levels as a route runner and pass-catcher, \nhe’s likely much closer to his realistic ceiling than other prospects in his tier. Expect him to at least make a practice squad, if \nnot earn one of the final spots on a depth chart as a reserve.  \n \nWhite’s draft capital will be low enough that he will need to maximize every opportunity to move up. Otherwise, more \nreceivers with similar skills and better athletic ability will be coming along soon enough.  \n \nReleases: White has a staggered stance at the line with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His hands rest at \neither side of his front knee. When he begins his release, White sinks into his stance. He rolls off the front foot with no \nwasted motion from the backfoot.  \nWhite’s pads are over his knees and his head is up. He can put his head down against tighter coverage and bring it up \nbefore his break and that can tip off his breaks. Against deep cushions, his head stays up.  \nWhen White is the primary receiver, he attacks downhill hard and at full speed with his pads over his knees and arms \npumping with a sprinter’s gain. When he passes an off-coverage defender on the outside, he uses a swat to continue inside.  \nWhite uses a stick at the top of his stem to set up routes breaking in the opposite direction. He has a nice change of pace \nwhen he takes a patient approach with the stem toward the defender before executing a sudden double up with the outside \nfoot.  \nThis sets up a dip inside the defender. White repeatedly uses the double up inside to set up a corner fade on red-zone \nroutes. He’ll also use it for the slant on that side as his counterpunch.  \nWhite uses a wipe to counter the hands of a defender on a release inside. He has a sudden two-quick off the line to work \ninside a defender. His trigger step is effective for screens.  \nWhite has a good swat-swim combination off a two-quick. He likes using this when running the red-zone fade from the left \nside whereas he uses the double-up on the right side. His hesitation with a shed counter to get outside a defender at the \nline of scrimmage is effective.  \nHe’ll steal a release with a two-quick. He has an effective shed to work outside a defender.  \nSeparation: White can earn separation on the deep post against a cornerback playing man-to-man. He will stack a \ndefender within the first 10 yards on a vertical route.  \nRoute Stems: White dives inside to attack the inside leverage of off-coverage defenders. He widens stems against off \ncoverage and attacks their feet. He’ll work into the back of the defender to set up back-shoulder targets.  \nRoute Setups: White uses a stick at the top of his stem to set up routes breaking in the opposite direction. If he sold the \nstick with his eyes or a head fake, he could influence the defensive back more often. He improved upon this in 2024 versus \nwhat I saw in 2023.  \nHe peeks well on the out-and-up, which he should translate to other routes. He also delivers a good in-set at the top of \nstems against off-coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: White has a flat speed break on shallow routes. His line step is flat enough for a flat break. He gets his head \naround during the break and presents a friendly target. His drive step is sharper breaking to his right than it is breaking to \nhis left. He must cultivate a flatter drive step to his left.  \nWhite has a three-step break with a long break step. He drops his weight effectively out of the break step and he finishes \nfriendly. After his break, tempo a slide to more open space as a target.  \nWhite also has weight drop into a whip route, but must show he can decelerate and re-accelerate in and out of this break.  \n\n \n199 \nWhite must learn to cultivate snap with his turns. When the first break doesn’t earn a target, White will work into an open \narea.  \nHe works back to the ball out of curls and comebacks.  \nZone Routes: White reads the shallow zone triangle, works to depth, and settles into the open space. When breaking \nacross the zone, he waits to clear the buzz/rollover defender before showing his eyes. White also tempos his break. He’s \ngood at communicating to his quarterback that he’s open.  \nRoute Boundary: White is aware of the boundary on out routes and toe-taps both feet inbounds. He can high-point and \ndrag his feet at the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: White leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at shoulder height and this has delayed his transitions \ndownfield. It has also limited him as a boundary player, tapping only one foot in bounds when he could have earned both if \nhe didn’t leave his feet.  \nWhite displays late hands with vertical routes at the boundary. He can separate horizontally late on a fade route. He’ll frame \nseparation late so the defender can’t tell when the ball is arriving.  \nHands/Catch Radius: White catches targets at his beltline with underhand position away from his frame. He uses \noverhand position for targets at the numbers.  \nWhite attacks the ball at the earliest point with using overhand position. His hands are too far apart when using overhand \nattack and he claps onto the ball. Still, he appears to have large hands which may mitigate some of the issue – validate \nassessment of hand size at NFL Combine.  \nWhite extends his arms fully to targets ahead of his break path and retracts them into his frame while on the move.  \nWhite also clap-attacks high-point catches. He also clap-attacks targets low and at his back hip behind his break path and \nthis can lead to his losing the ball in this case.  \nPosition: White will jump up and through on a back-shoulder target. He is early enough with the leap so that he can leap \nstraight up without any leaning. He has a good pullback and he’ll embrace the fall.  \nFocus: White can take contact to his back as he attacks the ball. He can also take contact to his chest during a jump up and \nthrough. White can take hard shots to his back as he makes a catch over the middle.  \nTransitions: White transitions downhill with catch and pierce principles and obeys the direction of the ball. He has a good \nfeel for the zone triangle and how to attack it after the catch.  \nElusiveness: He can make the first man miss with stop-start movement. He can use a two-quick and a stick to set up a \nsafety and make the defender miss as he’s pursuing downhill. His stick is one of his best moves in the open field. He can \npress inside on a route over the middle, stick, and bounce the play outside for field-flipping gains.  \nWhite has an effective spin when transitioning downhill. He can jump cut and hurdle low shot.  \nVision: White has a good feel for where defenders are on the field relative to him at the catch point. He knows when to spin \nor step up or back to avoid the pursuit and buy himself time and space to operate.  \nWhen working through an open zone, he can find opportunities to work into open space and earn strong gains.  \nPower: When wrapped high, White keeps his feet moving and earns yards after the wrap. He uses a stiff arm to ward off \nreaches to his frame, forcing the defender to slide down and wrap his feet.  \nDirect Contact Balance: When he has momentum downhill, he can win direct collisions to his chest against safeties.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: White can bounce of indirect contact to his pads from safeties. \nBall Security: White carries the ball high to his chest. He can take a hit to the ball-carrying arm and maintain possession. \nWhite is prone to carrying the ball under his left arm when at the right boundary, but he has shown he can tuck the ball \nunder his right arm. He swings the ball in the open field when he’s running at full speed.  \n\n \n200 \nBlocking: When attacking defenders positioned over him, White uses a double jab and aims for the defender’s chest.  \nWhen working Most Dangerous Man Blocks White can overextend or over pursue inside but he uses his arm length to \nclothesline the blocker’s frame long enough so he can correct his position and cut off the defender. White can anchor \nagainst a safety delivering a hard shot with a long runway. He moves his feet once he earns position on the defender.  \nWhite will shield a linebacker. He can overextend to deliver a shot to a linebacker. He must learn to punch rather than ram \nhis head and pads into the opponent.  \nWhite will work inside to attack a Most Dangerous Man assignment and then pass on the block to a teammate to peel \ntoward the safety. \nWith Man Over Me assignments, White sets up defenders inside-out to earn position and cut them off from the ball carrier. \nWhite earns good position to the outside shoulder of the force player and pushes the defender out of the path of the ball \ncarrier.  \nWhen he latches onto the defender he can be difficult to shed. He has a good tilt technique to work into the downfield \ndefender after running off the man with his route.  \nDurability: Redshirt for Michigan State in 2021. Missed final three games in 2020 due to injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar to see if White is playing well. If his team describes him as faster than \nthey thought and he’s delivering in practices, you can add him to an expanded offseason roster to see if the buzz is rooted \nin facts.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nAwareness of the Zone Triangle \n• \nSpeed Out to Right, Clap-attack, Boundary Awareness \n• \nTakes Back of DB, Jump Up and Through, Clap-attack \n• \nOut-and-Up, Jump Up and Through, Pull Back, Embraces Fall, Clap-attack \n• \nOpen-Field Stick and Bounce \n• \nJump Up and Through, Pull Back, Boundary Drag \n• \nLeaves Feet Unnecessarily \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n201",
        "analysis": "Ricky White III is a WR prospect with a blend of strengths and weaknesses that project him as a potential rotational starter or practice squad player.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running Fundamentals:** Possesses a solid foundation in route running, showing proficiency in various techniques like stems, breaks, and releases.  He demonstrates understanding of zone concepts and boundary awareness.\n* **Vertical Prowess (College Level):**  Showed the ability to win deep against college competition.\n* **Ball Tracking (with caveats):**  Displays good ability to track the ball in certain situations (e.g., back-shoulder throws).\n* **After the Catch Ability:** Shows promise in making defenders miss and creating yards after the catch using moves like the stick and spin.\n* **Blocking:** Exhibits potential as a blocker, particularly in certain situations (Most Dangerous Man, Man Over Me assignments).\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Ball Attack:** His most pressing need.  His wide hands and \"clap-attack\" technique lead to drops, significantly hindering his potential.  This needs immediate attention.\n* **Enhance Route Running Precision:** While fundamentally sound, refinement is needed in pacing, holding defenders longer, and optimizing breaks.\n* **Increase Speed:** His speed is considered pedestrian by NFL standards.  Improvement here would significantly raise his ceiling.\n* **Consistency:** Needs to demonstrate more consistency in all facets of his game to prove his reliability at the NFL level.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Ball Security/Drops:**  Prone to drops due to his poor ball-attack technique.\n* **Speed:** Lacks elite speed, limiting his ability to consistently win deep in the NFL.\n* **Hands:**  Technique needs significant improvement to become a reliable pass catcher.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparisons (Torry Holt, Antonio Bryant, Ronnie Bell, Tre Turner) suggest a wide range of potential outcomes.  Holt is a high-end comparison, highlighting White's potential, but also implying a need to overcome similar speed limitations that Holt had to succeed.  Bryant represents a potentially high-risk, high-reward outcome,  Bell and Turner represent more realistic, perhaps lower ceiling comparisons.  The range underscores the uncertainty surrounding his NFL future, heavily dependent on his ability to significantly improve his ball-catching skills.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWhite has the potential to make an NFL roster, but his success hinges on significant improvement in his ball-catching technique.  His NFL future likely lies as a rotational player or special teamer if he addresses his shortcomings.  His draft stock will likely be low, requiring him to make the most of every opportunity.\n"

He’s a savvy route runner in the underneath zones because he understands how to set up zone and man \ncoverage with pacing and misdirection.  \n \nAfter the catch, Presley has skilled footwork to work around and over tackles. He’s a determined and creative runner for his \nsize.  \n \n\n \n202 \nPresley’s hands are good enough to compete for a role, but he fights the ball more often that what you see with a \nprofessional slot receiver. Presley’s hands are too wide at the fingertips and this is the root cause of his battles with targets.  \n \nIf Presley tightens up his attack of the ball and lands on a team with a quarterback who possesses excellent game \nmanagement and processing, Presley could emerge as a weekly box score factor and deliver 600-800 yards and 3-5 scores \nin a season.  \n \nAnything more would be a career-year due to unusual circumstances because Presley isn’t a big-play threat at the slot \nposition. He’s a volume producer who can occasionally earn a chunk play between the intermediate and deep zones.  \n \nPresley’s skills in the open field should give him a shot to make a roster as a punt return specialist. From there, he can \nprove his worth in the slot. \n \nReleases: Presley has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His arms hang at either \nside at the front knee. He sinks into his stance when he begins his release. There is no wasted movement and he rolls off \nhis front foot.  \nPresley exits his release with his head up and his pads over his knees.  \nPresley uses a two-quick to steal a release. Against off-coverage, Presley uses a double up and counters with a wipe. He \nalso uses a two-quick with a wipe counter or a shed counter. Presley also has a strong hip-shift with a wipe counter against \noff-coverage. \nHe combines a read step, a two-quick, and counters with a swat-swim against tight man coverage. He also has a read step \nand a double-up combo.  \nPresley uses an abbreviated hesitation into a two-quick at the top of stems on shallow out-breaking routes and when \nstealing a release. His hesitation and double up is also a good combo.  \nPresley combines a two-quick with a read step to set up an outside release. Presley’s two-quick and stick are a good \ncombination for his diamond release on a slant.  \nHe uses a hard stick at the top of stems. He also uses a stick and shoulder reduction combo against off-coverage early in his \nrelease.  \nSeparation: Presley can separate from some safeties and slot corners.  \nRoute Stems: He stems inside against inside shade leverage on shallow routes. He widens the stem with outside shade \ncoverage. He will run at a defender at the top of his stem. He’ll work into the toes of the defender on curls and hitches.  \nRoute Setups: Presley slows his pace against off-coverage and then uses a sudden two quick to contrast the patient \napproach to it. His pacing is good to set up a slant-fade in the red zone. He also dives effectively to the inside and sells it \nwith his entire body to set up the fade.  \nHe has a very good pace change that sets up a read step at top of a stem and a peek to the fade route before actually \nbreaking inside on the slant or up the seam.  \nPresley stair-steps after early separation in a route and can punctuate it with an inset before executing the break.  \nRoute Breaks: Presley has a flat speed break with flat drive and line steps on shallow and intermediate speed outs. He \nsnaps his head around once he clears a rollover defender. He creates a friendly position to the quarterback.  \nPresley has good weight drop with whip routes. With speed breaks, Presley will punch the boundary arm to generate snap.  \nZone Routes: Presley identifies the second-level defender and the zone triangle. He works to depth and settles into the \nopen field with a friendly position to the quarterback.  \nWhen working across a zone, Presley tempos his breaks across the field and doesn’t show his eyes until he has crossed the \nrollover/buzz defender and is ready for the ball.  \nRoute Boundary: Presley can tap his feet at the boundary or tap one and drag the other after high-pointing.  \n\n \n203 \nPass Tracking: Presley can track the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage. He can make a late turn to the ball and \nshow late hands against tight coverage. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets arriving above his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Presley attacks the ball at an early window when using overhand position. The overhand attack is \nwide at the fingers but tight at the thumbs.   \nHe attacks targets behind his break point with effective overhand position. Presley uses the appropriate attack for the \ntrajectory of the ball.  \nHe’ll high-point the ball and turn behind his break path to do so. Presley also wins extensions high and wide of his frame.  \nHe can extend low – below his knees – to attack a target, but his hands must be tighter. He fights the ball in these \ninstances.  \nPosition: Presley has an effective pullback and embraces the fall. Presley will jump and through to attack the ball with \noverhand position but he must track the ball better so he times his jump earlier and at a better spot so the defender doesn’t \nhave ideal position to knock the ball away from his hands.  \nFocus: Presley can extend wide of his frame to a ball leading him into a defender who clotheslines him or hits his legs. He \ntracks the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage and contact to his back—including hard contact.  \nTransitions: Presley uses catch-and-pierce technique to get downhill immediately after the catch.  \nElusiveness: Presley will spin off contact in the open field. As a runner, he can transition at the edge of the box to a \ndownhill path with one step. He can transition downfield from the far-side flat with two quick steps. He can drop his weight \nto quickly decelerate. He has a tight spin out of the deceleration.  \nPresley’s stick is an effective method of making defenders miss in traffic and in the open field.  \nVision: Presley identifies cutback lanes. He knows when to transition downhill on perimeter runs from the backfield. Presley \nalso knows when to split defenders in the open field. He navigates traffic well and has a feel for cutback lanes based on the \npursuit of defenders over him.  \nPresley sets up blocks downfield and presses them tight enough to ride the way on the cutback or bounce.  \nPower: Presley keeps his feet moving through contact. He has an effective stiff arm to work through reaches to his frame. \nHe pulls through lower-body reaches. He kicks his heels up as he pulls though the contact to maintain his balance. Presley \nalso has a good balance-touch.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Presley can drop his pads into direct contact with a safety and win the collision when he can keep \nhis feet moving.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Presley bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks.  \nBall Security: Presley carries the ball high to his chest but the elbow is loose from his frame. He’s prone to using his right \narm even if working outside the left hash, but he has shown he can use the left arm for the left side of the field. He can take \ncontact to the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlocking: Presley stems inside and earns a flat position to cut off the safety. Presley shuffles his feet patiently to close the \ngap with a defender while in a square and squat position. His hands are tight enough to get into the chest of the defender. \nHe moves his feet well to remain square to his assignment and shield the defender’s pursuit. He also works hard to get his \nhands in a good position so he can sustain position.  \nPresley can do more to close the gap tighter so his elbows are bent more and he’s not cast aside as easily. He does a better \njob when he approaches with aggression. He doesn’t overextend often, but when he does, he drops his head and tips off the \napproach. The opponent has an easy time shedding him to the ball carrier.  \nPresley earns a flat position against a linebacker or safety on Most Dangerous Man assignments. He doesn’t win collisions \nwith larger defenders or even defensive backs who have downhill momentum into the collision.  \nDurability: Played in all but one game in his career. Left WVU game in 2024 with an unspecified injury.  \n \n\n \n204 \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Presley will be a better waiver-wire addition during the season as a deep stash on fantasy \nbenches because he’s not a big-play option. If your league factors return yardage, Presley earns late-round value. \nOtherwise, monitor from afar and target players with higher ceilings – even if Presley has a higher floor. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSlant-Fade, Late Hands/Turn, Pullback, Embraces the Fall \n• \nDeceleration, Footwork, Transitions, Balance \n• \nStick, Peek, Catch behind Break Path, RAC, TD \n• \nHigh-Point, Early Attack, Pull Back, Tap and Drag, Embrace the Fall \n• \nRelease on Crosser, High-Point, Embrace Fall vs Tight Coverage \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n205",
        "analysis": "Brennan Presley is a slot receiver and return specialist prospect with a high floor but limited ceiling.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Savvy Route Runner:** Excellent at setting up coverage with pacing and misdirection, particularly in underneath zones.  He demonstrates a strong understanding of route concepts and how to use leverage against defenders.  His release package is diverse and effective, showcasing multiple techniques depending on coverage.\n* **After the Catch Ability:**  Possesses skilled footwork and creative running style, allowing him to make defenders miss and gain extra yards. He's a determined runner for his size.\n* **Return Specialist Potential:** His open-field skills suggest he could be a valuable punt returner in the NFL.\n* **Reliable Hands (with caveats):** While his hands are described as \"good enough,\"  his tendency to fight the ball due to wide fingertip placement needs improvement.  His catch percentage on pinpoint targets is perfect, highlighting the potential.\n* **Good Route Breaks and Setups:**  Executes sharp breaks and utilizes pace changes effectively to create separation, particularly on speed outs and slants.  He shows a solid understanding of zone concepts and how to find open space.\n* **Physicality:** Despite his size, he keeps his feet moving through contact and uses a stiff arm effectively.  He demonstrates good balance and can win some collisions.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Hand Technique:** Refining his hand placement to more consistently secure the ball will significantly elevate his game.\n* **Increase Big-Play Potential:** While he is a volume producer, developing the ability to consistently make big plays would greatly enhance his value.  \n* **Consistency in Blocking:** While he shows effort in blocking, improving technique and power to consistently engage and sustain blocks is crucial.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Size:** His smaller stature (5'8\", 175 lbs) limits his ability to win jump balls and compete against larger defensive backs.\n* **Hand Technique:** Fighting the ball and having wide fingertips are significant issues that need immediate attention.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** Needs to improve his consistency and power in blocking assignments, particularly against larger defenders.\n* **Limited Deep Threat:** He's not a big-play threat, primarily operating in the short-to-intermediate areas of the field.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Braxton Berrios and Brittain Covey accurately reflect his profile as a smaller, shifty slot receiver and returner who excels in the short-to-intermediate passing game.  He lacks the explosiveness of Berrios, however, and likely won't have the same impact on offense.  Covey is perhaps a more apt comparison based on size and overall skillset.  He'll need to improve to separate himself from that comparison.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nPresley projects as a rotational player and special teams contributor in the NFL. His success will heavily depend on his ability to refine his hand technique and potentially add some explosiveness to his game.  While he has a high floor as a reliable slot receiver and returner, his ceiling is relatively low due to his size and limited big-play potential.\n"

The potential good news is \nthat Smith only has one issue with his technique and that’s his hands get too wide at the point of attack when he extends \nhis arms to the ball.  \n \nThis leads to clap-attacks where Smith either fights the ball or the ball flies between his hands and he completely misses the \ntarget. When Smith’s hands are close enough to win the ball, he’s capable of acrobatic adjustments high, low, away from \nhis frame, and against tight coverage and hits.  \n\n \n206 \n \nSmith is a frustrating player for fans because they see the game-changer he can be when things are going right. He’s a \nbreakaway speedster with vision, agility, and functional power for his size.  \n \nUnfortunately, when a receiver drops a deep pass, especially when they are open or nearly make tough play that should \nhave been caught, the disappointment factor for fans has more psychological gravity than dropping most short and \nintermediate targets. My theory: Most deep passes can change the game while few short and intermediate targets have that \ngravitas.  \n \nSo what’s the potential good news, Matt? Because Smith only has one issue with his hands, it should be easier for him to \ncorrect it. He doesn’t have a tracking problem. His choices of how to attack the ball are sound. And focus drops don’t plague \nhis game.  \n \nSmith will need to identify this problem and do the daily work until it’s ingrained into his game. This could take a while and \nthe discipline and patience required is easier said than done—especially for a young player with all the changes that an NFL \ncontract will bring to his life.  \n \nIf Smith can do it, he can become a viable starter with big-play upside. His route skills aren’t top-notch, but he’ll be \ncompetent enough for what a team requires of him and most of what he has to learn doesn’t require him unlearning bad \nhabits.   \n \nBecause Smith offers value as a return specialist and YAC receiver in space, he’s a good investment for an NFL team based \non what he can offer them right now.  \n \nTechnical: When he drops targets, he’s clap-attacking. Low targets may be more difficult for him than other types.  \nReleases: Smith has a staggered stance. His back foot is wider than normal from his front foot for a receiver’s stance. \nThere’s 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front leg. His pads are further forward than what we often see. He looks a \nlittle like he’s using a stance one would see in the 1980s – the torso position may prove too far forward for today’s game. \nHis hands hang at either side of his front knee.  \nSmith’s knee bend in his stance is deep but there’s still room for him to sink further into his stance to generate a good \nrelease off the line. He doesn’t sink into his stance and there’s a slight rock of the back foot before Smith rolls off the front \nfoot.  \nSmith’s arms move at nearly full range of motion to sell the vertical potential of the route. His pads are over his knees, his \nhead is up and facing forward, and he runs his stems at a good pace.  \nWhile the head is initially up and facing forward, he repeatedly drops his head during his stem. It bobs up and down as he \nsprints.  \nSmith has a double up with good range of motion, but no artistry with pacing. Smith uses a stick with a wipe counter at the \ntop of stems against off-coverage.  \nSmith will counter a defender’s hands with a swat-swim. The swim can be cleaner, but he gets separation. He has a clean \nswat against outside shade. His shed is violent. So is his blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed combo.  \nSmith has a quick read step with a violent double swat to get inside tight coverage playing outside shade at the line in the \nred zone. The only patient and sudden move he executes is the read step.  \nSmith uses a two-quick to steal a release in the running game. He also uses the two-quick to attack outside leverage and \ncounter the defender’s hands with a violent shed.  \nSmith has a hip shift at the top of stems against off-coverage defenders.  \nSeparation: Smith can threaten a deep safety when working up the seams on vertical routes. On deep-range targets, he \ncan pull away from safeties. He will stack a defender deep, including corners playing off-coverage.  \nRoute Stems: Smith widens stems against outside leverage. He dives inside against inside leverage. He’ll chase the near \nhip of the defender and take the back of the defender late in the stem of an intermediate or vertical route.  \n\n \n207 \nSmith will also run at the feet of the defender deep into the stem on a vertical route.  \nRoute Setups: Smith will deliver a head fake toward the boundary as a peek at the top of a stem over the middle. He pairs \nthe head fake with a stick. Both moves are sudden.  \nSmith has won against off-coverage defenders in the vertical game thanks to pace change mid-stem before accelerating \npast and stacking. He’ll also use the pace change just before he takes the back of the defender and then breaks inside the \ndefender’s chest.  \nRoute Breaks: Smith has a long break step leading into weight drop and a three-step break on an intermediate curl. He \nworks back to the ball. The weight drop can be deeper.  \nHis weight drop improved with intermediate curls when running a three-step break. He can beat a lot of coverage with that \nmove.  \nSmith can also use a three-step break without the break step and earns depth with his weight drop. His drop and pop break \nhas a long break step and weight drop.  \nWhen delivering a hard break with weight drop at the top of an intermediate stem, Smith can break inside with flat drive \nand line steps. Smith gets his head around to the quarterback quickly out of his speed breaks. He has lapses where his \ndrive step is flat, but the line step is rounded off and his break drifts downfield.  \nHe runs a flat speed break in the intermediate range of the field. His turn has snap and the drive and line steps are flat.  \nZone Routes: Smith identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, an settles into a space. That space where he \nsettles can be areas where he should see immediately that it’s not an open space and he should adjust, but he doesn’t. \nWatch to see if there was a rationale for this (working over the top of a mesh route and not wanting to clog a break lane for \none of the underneath crossers) or if it’s a repeat behavior regardless of circumstance.  \nSmith has also shown that he can find an opening to settle that’s feasible. He doesn’t show his eyes on vertical breaks \nthrough zones until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target or break into an open area, Smith works elsewhere to earn separation. \nRoute Boundary: Smith can make a spinning catch at the boundary and drag his feet to remain in bounds. He can also run \nthe speed out and make a low and away catch while dragging his front and back foot.  \nPass Tracking: Smith keeps his feet on the ground when catching targets where leaping is unnecessary. Smith tracks the \nball over his shoulder on vertical routes but his hands can get too wide at the attack point and he allows the ball to pass \nthrough.  \nSmith can track over his shoulder and use overhand position to do so.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Smith can use overhand attack for targets at chest-height. He can use overhand attack to work \nbehind his break path to his back hip on a wide route and catch the ball.  \nSmith attacks the ball at its earliest point. Smith doesn’t have to turn his torso to make the catch, which makes his \ntransition downhill easier. He’s consistently effective at extending his arms to attack the ball away from his frame when \nusing overhand attack.  \nHe can use underhand attack for targets at the beltline. When tracking over the shoulder his hands must be tighter so the \nball doesn’t travel through.  \nSmith squats quickly and deep enough to dig out low throws in the underneath zone and at the boundary. He makes \ncatches of low throws when he can square the ball and squat to make the catch. If he has to extend forward or away from \nhis frame for the ball, he has proven far less reliable.  \nThe biggest issue with Smith’s hands is that they can be too wide at the attack point and it forces complete misses or a \nclap-drops.  \n\n \n208 \nPosition: Smith has good timing and extension with back-shoulder plays where he’s not dealing with coverage as an \nobstacle. When Smith makes a catch spinning toward oncoming contact, he can execute a pullback to protect the ball from \ncontact.  \nSmith can embrace the fall when tracking over his shoulder on a vertical route as long as he isn’t parallel with the ground as \nhe’s making the catch. This gives him time to clap-attack or trap the ball and turn. When he’s closer to the ground and clap-\nattacking, he has no time to do that and embrace the fall.  \nSmith can jump up and through on an underthrown target.  \nFocus: Smith can attack the ball with a spinning catch above his back shoulder and take a glancing shot to his pads and \nchest from the safety over the top. He can take contact to his back after going airborne to catch a target over his shoulder \nat the highest point.  \nTransitions: Smith obeys the direct of the ball when he catches and pierces downfield.  \nElusiveness: Smith has the curvilinear speed to transition downhill to the far-side flat on a perimeter run. He’ll spin off \ncontact from defensive backs and at least fall forward.   \nSmith attempts to bait defenders playing over the top of him with hard head fakes before dipping in the opposite direction \nof the fake.  \nSmith changes stride length and pacing to set up blocks. He’s a light-footed player who can deliver lateral cuts and jump \ncuts to avoid contact.  \nSmith only needs two short and quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter path.  \nVision: Smith is a patient runner who presses defenders into blockers on RPOs and screens before cutting into the open \ncrease that the press helped create.  \nPower: Smith finishes with low pad level. He can collide with safeties and spin forward. Smith pulls through the reach of a \nlinebacker to his torso. He can stay upright when a defensive end wraps him high.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Smith can run over a cornerback in the open field when he has downhill momentum into the \ncollision. He can bounce off a direct hit from a safety without much momentum.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Smith bounces off glancing shots from safeties—he’ll even initiate the contact.  \nBall Security: Smith carries the ball high to his chest when he knows there’s an impending collision. When running in the \nopen field and in loose traffic, he swings the ball. He has lost the ball when a defender reaches for him in backside pursuit \nand gets access to the ball-carrying arm.  \nSmith tucks targets caught at the left side of the field under his right arm. He uses his left arm on running plays designed to \nthe left side.  \nBlocking: Smith will approach Most Dangerous Man assignments. He’s prone to overextending, tipping off his motives, and \nthe safety avoiding the collision. When he delivers his hands, they are jabs without extension and there’s no force other \nthan whatever downhill momentum he generates and that’s not always controlled.  \nAt the same time, Smith will slide inside to a linebacker, square the defender, take the air out of the interaction, and sustain \nposition. Smith crosses his forearms tight to his chest at the collision point, so he’s not delivering a punch as much as \nbracing himself for contact. It can be effective at temporarily shielding the defender.  He does this well to seal the inside on \nperimeter runs.  \nSmith will deliver his forearms into a linebacker and he can knock the defender backward a step or two.  \nWhen executing Man Over Me assignments, Smith sinks his hips and earns square position as he shuffles his feet in a wide \nstance. Smith transitions from route runner to blocker, earning a squat position downfield and working to square the \nopponent.  \nWhen he punches, he delivers his hands to the chest of the opponent and can deliver multiple shots from a square position. \nHe moves his feet to redirect as the defender redirects. He can generate a push with his strikes.  \n\n \n209 \nSmith can attack with his hands tight. He also transitions well from route runner to blocker. He works to earn good position \non the defender to help his teammate.  \nDurability: Hip injury against Mississippi State in 2024. Smith had an ankle injury that cost him the Kent State game in \n2022. He missed fall camp and the early part of the season due to surgery on the ankle. He tore his meniscus in his right \nknee and broken his leg in November of 2021. Both required surgery.  \n \nSmith coped with turf toe in 2021’s fall camp.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Consider Smith a viable late-round target because of his YAC skills and field-stretching \nspeed. In today’s NFL, the vertical game isn’t as pronounced so Smith’s value isn’t as high as what Henry Ruggs or Ted \nGinn’s value was in the past.  \n \nStill, if Smith fixes his drops, he has potential to be a complete receiver. At a late-round price, it’s worth holding him for a \nyear or two to find out. If your league has return yardage as a factor, Smith could be a third or fourth-round value.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBack-Shoulder Extension and Leaping Transition \n• \nSpinning Back-Shoulder Catch, Pull-Down, Contact, Dragging Feet \n• \nClap-Trap Low and Away Throw and Doesn’t Embrace Fall \n• \nTwo Successful Deep Posts \n• \nShed, Long Break Step, Hard Break, Flat Drive and Line, and Settle \n• \nThree-Step Hard Break with Weight Drop and Long Break Step \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n210",
        "analysis": "Arian Smith is a WR prospect with elite speed and impressive athleticism, but his inconsistent hands are a significant concern.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elite Speed and Agility:**  Smith possesses breakaway speed and agility, capable of stretching the field and creating big plays after the catch (YAC).  His acceleration and elusiveness allow him to pull away from defenders and make difficult catches in space.\n* **YAC Ability:** He's a dangerous threat after the catch, using his speed and agility to evade tackles and gain extra yards.  This makes him a valuable asset even if his receiving consistency is a concern.\n* **Return Specialist Potential:** Smith’s speed and agility translate well to the return game, making him a valuable asset on special teams.\n* **Physicality:** For his size, he shows functional power, capable of fighting for the ball and taking hits.  He also demonstrates some ability to block.\n* **Route Running Potential:**  While not elite, his route running is competent, and he shows flashes of advanced techniques (like pace changes and head fakes) that can be refined.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Hand Technique Improvement:**  His biggest weakness is his tendency to \"clap-attack\" the ball, leading to drops. If he can improve this aspect of his game, his potential skyrockets.  The fact that this is a largely technical issue (rather than a fundamental flaw) suggests it’s correctable.\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  With coaching, he can further refine his already competent route running to become a more consistent threat.\n* **Becoming a Complete Receiver:**  The combination of his athletic gifts and potential for improvement suggests he could become a complete and dangerous receiver in the NFL.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Inconsistent Hands:**  His drops, primarily due to poor hand placement, are a major concern that could significantly limit his value.\n* **Durability:**  He has a history of injuries, including ankle, knee, and leg injuries, raising questions about his long-term health.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report lists a wide range of comparisons:\n\n* **High-End:** DeVonta Smith (suggests the potential if his hands improve) and Jameson Williams (similar speed and big-play ability).\n* **Mid-Range:**  X/Ted Ginn Jr. (speed and return ability, but with Ginn's inconsistency) and Ihmir Smith-Marsette (similar athletic profile but less polished).\n\nThe wide range reflects the uncertainty surrounding Smith's NFL potential.  He could be a star if he corrects his hands, or a role player with return value if he doesn't.  The Ginn comparison is probably the most realistic baseline expectation at this point.\n"

He had some academic logistics that needed to \nbe addressed before he transferred and the missed August practice and three games after knee surgery. The active \nreceiving leader in touchdowns at UTSA, Franklin looked like a different player at Illinois.  \n \nFranklin has developed some release packages that have artistry with pacing that can properly bait a defender. His route \nsetups and breaks aren’t as fluid, but they are moving in the right direction. If Franklin can accelerate a little more into the \n\n \n211 \ntop of stems and drop his weight deeper, he’ll have potential to become and effective route runner against man-to-man in \nthe NFL.  \n \nFranklin has strong hand-eye coordination, and he has probably gotten away with winning targets with these skills alone. In \nthe NFL, Franklin must learn to use the optimal hand position at all times if he wants to maximize his opportunities. Franklin \nhas lapses where he allows targets into his frame when he could have attacked the ball at the earliest window of arrival. \nThis will be the difference between him becoming a reliable option on timing routes and an option quarterbacks lack \nconfidence in targeting.  \n \nIf Franklin can refine his routes and catch-point techniques, he’ll get to use his substantial YAC skills. He’s patient, creative, \nand agile runner who routinely makes the first defender miss, if not the second. \n \nTransferring from Ole Miss to Illinois helped Franklin reconnect to his game and build on it. As is, he has a chance to stick to \nan active roster this year. With continued dedication to his craft, he could challenge for a contributing role in 1-2 years.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? Franklin improved his sale of the vertical route off the line at Ole Miss. At Illinois, \nFranklin was more explosive from the beginning to the end of the route.  \nTechnical: Franklin must attack in-breaking routes at the earliest window rather than allow them into his frame. They often \ngo through is hands and bounce off his body.  \nConceptual: Franklin plays with intensity which can boil over in one-on-one matchups with defensive backs when they \nmake a good play and force mistakes on his end.  \nReleases: Franklin has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. There’s not much bend with \nhis knees. His arms hang uncrossed at either side of his front knee.  \nWhen he releases from the line, Franklin sinks lower into his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion but \ncan have lapses where he steps with the front foot rather than rolls off it.  \nFranklin has a patient but sudden two-quick. He attacks the leverage of the defender and counters the hands of the \ndefender with a shed. He’ll also counter the defender’s hands with a swat when running a fade from the slot.  \nFranklin’s quickness shows up with his footwork, whether it’s a two-quick or a foot-switch, he can get past the press \ndefender. The same is true with his double-up where he includes a good head fake.  \nHe’ll steal a release in the run game.  \nFranklin has a capable swat-swim counter that’s sudden enough to do the job and he can perform it as a counter to a hip \nshift mid-stem. His hip shifts need more exaggeration to sell it well against off coverage. His double swat is effective.  \nHe has a hesi but the movement looks stilted instead of fluid. His stick at the top of his stem has some punch but could \ndeliver significantly more. His read step has good suddenness and violence.  \nHe combines a double up with a hard stick. He’ll try to combine a read step with a throw-by but the placement of his hand \non the throw-by is too early and far from the defender’s frame. The combo of a read step and stick is effective. So is the \nread step and shed.  \nFranklin’s hesi and two-quick combination has a strong contrast with patience and suddenness. He counters the defender’s \nhands with a wipe.  \nSeparation: Despite his quickness, the acceleration and speed didn’t appear to be enough to challenge cornerbacks on an \nisland with him in 2024. He was playing through injury. In 2024, Franklin looked healthier and faster. His in-game speed \ndata also reflects this.  \nRoute Stems: Franklin will dive inside or widen outside to begin stems that set up outside breaks. The energy-pace with \nhis stems can be low when not targeted and in scenarios where the energy needs to be strong to sell a route that will \noccupy the coverage near the intended target.  \nFranklin can allow defenders to pin him to the boundary and out of bounds when he fades too early to the boundary during \nhis stems.  \n\n \n212 \nRoute Setups: Franklin does a good job playing with pace mid-stem to setup off-coverage. He’ll also give a hint taking the \nback of the defender with a pair of steps a little wider than the original path of the stem.  \nFranklin can run at the feet of the defender playing off him to set up an out-breaking route.  \nFranklin will sell a deeper route with a head fake downward and over his knees at the top of his stem or a look to the \nboundary that can get off-coverage to turn his hips. He can also deliver a peek inside off a pace change where he dips two \nsteps outside then accelerates inside with a peek before breaking on the fade outside. All of this is good, but he must \ndeliver it faster and with greater fluidity to sell it at a high level.  \nFranklin will use an inset against off-coverage to set up an out-breaking route. He’ll stair-step some in-breaking zone routes \nagainst high-low coverage.  \nFranklin has a good stop-and-go route with a stick to the outside after he drops his weight.  \nRoute Breaks: Franklin earns a flat break with his line steps on speed outs and works back to the quarterback. He can \ndrop his weight into breaks and flip his hips in the opposite direction. He can do more to generate some snap with his turns \non speed breaks.  \nOn sideline curls, Franklin has a long break step at a good pace but doesn’t sink his hips nearly enough to come to a sudden \nstop so he can work back to the ball quickly.  \nWith shallow routes versus tight coverage, Franklin must square up the target so he can post-up the opponent and prevent \na reach into his attack area of the football.  \nHe has a long enough break step, but must drop the weight more with stop routes.  \nZone Routes: Franklin identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When working \nacross the zone, Franklin will tempo his break but he must also learn to wait to turn his head until he is away from the buzz \ndefender’s passing lane. He does a better job of this when working between zone defenders at different depths on vertical \nroutes.  \nIf his initial break against zone coverage isn’t into an open lane, he’ll slide toward and open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Franklin knows when to drop his frame to the ground with low targets so he can get a body part in \nbounds that will count as two feet. He can also extend toward the boundary wide of his frame for a high and wide target but \nalso tap both feet inbounds as he lands from the high-point. He can dig out low throws and drag both feet near the \nboundary while extending his upper body over the boundary line.  \nPass Tracking: When running intermediate routes and the target is at chest height or above, he will leave his feet but \nthat’s with the ball a little behind his break. Watch to see if this is a habit with targets where leaving his feet is more \nobviously unnecessary.  \nFranklin displays late hands with contested targets and back-shoulder plays.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Franklin addresses targets at chest and helmet level with overhand position and hands tight as the \nball arrives. Franklin can extend his arms underhand below his waist to catch targets on his body.  \nHe digs out low targets at the shoe tops with underhand position. He has occasional lapses with ideal hand position, \nallowing targets in the shallow range into his frame and using underhand position rather than attacking at the earliest \nwindow.  \nPosition: Franklin can embrace the fall on low throws so he doesn’t land on the ball. He has a jump through but must \nextend his arms and attack the ball and sometimes the attack is underhand rather than overhand.  \nFocus: Franklin can high-point a slant and take a hit/wrap to his back. He also has a capable jump through on back-\nshoulder fades. He extends one-handed on deep fades with a defender hanging onto his inside hip. \nTransitions: Frankling has efficient catch-and-pierce technique with routes facing the quarterback.  \nElusiveness: Franklin has a suddenness with short-area movement. He has a quick stutter that would be more compelling \nagainst defenders pursuing from a greater distance. His spin can shed reaches to his frame.  \n\n \n213 \nFranklin uses a double up effectively as a runner in the open field to fool pursuit over the top. He can get his feet over low \nshots. Franklin transitions downhill from a perimeter approach with two quick steps. \nHe routinely makes the first man miss, if two.  \nVision: Franklin will split defenders in the open field without hesitation and this helps him earn yardage. He follows blocks \nand creates without them. He’s patient, decisive, and capable of handling unanticipated shots.  \nPower: Franklin keeps his feet moving through reaches and wraps, pulling defenders for extra yardage. He’s successful \nwith warding off reaches with his stiff arm. He can run through some upper-body wraps from defensive backs.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Franklin can bounce off indirect contact to his pads from a safety.  \nBall Security: Franklin carries the ball high to his chest. He will carry the ball under his boundary-side arm and take \ncontact to the arm carrying the ball. If he catches a shallow target, Franklin can be guilty of not securing the ball and \ncarrying it wide or to the front of his chest like an option quarterback.  \nBlocking: Franklin will run off coverage and then tilt into them, grabbing the chest plate and turn the defender away from \nthe play. He’s not well-balanced with his position when doing this.  \nAs a stalk blocker with a Man Over Me Assignment, he earns a square and squat position within two yards of the defender. \nHe shoots his hands with an uppercut motion and bent elbows but overextends into the contact, leading with his head and \ncatching more contact than he delivers. He will follow up with a second strike but remains overextended.  \nWhen he’s not overextended his hands are too high on the defender and he can’t generate leverage and power with his \nlower body. He will take the defender where the defender wants to go and change his position to push the opponent beyond \nthe path to the ball carrier.  \nFranklin will deliver Most Dangerous Man blocks but he can work on earning a better position so he doesn’t lose after the \ninitial collision.  \nDurability: August knee surgery that cost Franklin the first three games of the 2023 season and then elected not to make \nthe trip with the team in November and Lane Kiffin told media to ask Franklin about not being there against Georgia.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nUTSA Highlights \n• \nIllinois Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n214",
        "analysis": "Zakhari Franklin is a WR prospect with intriguing potential but also significant areas needing improvement.  His strengths lie in his YAC ability, where he's patient, creative, and agile, routinely making defenders miss. He possesses strong hand-eye coordination and shows flashes of artistry in his release packages.  He also demonstrates good route concepts, identifying zone defenders and adapting his breaks accordingly.  His ability to high-point the ball and make contested catches is another plus.\n\nHowever, Franklin's opportunities for improvement are significant.  His route running needs refinement, particularly in acceleration into stems and dropping his weight deeper for better breaks against man coverage.  His catch-point technique is inconsistent, sometimes allowing the ball into his frame instead of attacking it aggressively.  He needs to improve his hand placement for optimal results and maintain consistency in this area.  His acceleration and speed, while improving, still need work to consistently separate from NFL-caliber cornerbacks. Finally, his blocking needs considerable technical improvement.\n\nHis player comparisons – Brandon Lloyd, Antonio Bryant, Dres Anderson – suggest a player with a blend of size, athleticism, and YAC ability, but also a player whose production is dependent on refining his technique.  The comparison spectrum highlights the range of possible outcomes, depending on how well he addresses his weaknesses.  He's projected as a rotational starter, implying that while he possesses starter-level ability in specific situations, he needs to improve to become a truly reliable, every-down player.  His durability is also a concern, given his injury history.  Overall, he's a high-risk, high-reward prospect whose NFL success depends heavily on continued development and improvement.\n"

He has competent release combinations that \nwork for him in college and should be the basis for eventual success in the NFL, but not likely as a vertical option. He’ll need \nto be in situations to gain separation with his acceleration within the first 10-15 yards of the line of scrimmage when facing \ntight coverage or get behind defensive backs with the aid of misdirection.  \n \n\n \n215 \nFor Hudson to thrive in the NFL, he must optimize his precision as a route runner to compensate for his speed that’s on the \nborderline between starter and contributor. Hudson has developed a few setup techniques at the top of stems to turn \ndefenders around before he breaks on vertical routes. He can also use these for routes breaking back to the quarterback.  \n \nAs with many of these prospects in this tier, Hudson must refine his breaks so they are precise and can be delivered at full \nspeed. At this point he’s missing refined speed breaks and hard breaks.  \n \nHudson is a good ball-tracker and is productive at the boundary. His hands can get too wide with his attacks, which can lead \nto him fighting or missing the ball. When he makes catches, Hudson wins against tight coverage and contact. He makes \neffective adjustments to win the ball.  \n \nHudson is an elusive runner with dynamic movement in the open field and sets up defenders into blocks as well as creates \nspace for himself with patient running. He must prove he can be a strong finish and run with power.  \n \nOverall Hudson could contribute in four-receiver sets against mismatched defenders. If he can elevate his man-to-man \ngame from the stem through the break-point, he can elevate his standing from talented open-field threat to a well-rounded \noption capable of weekly contributions.  \n \nWhere has Hudson Improved: Hudson has a three-quick break, and he has developed a long break step. He also \ndeveloped weight drop with this route when running shorter routes. This is an improvement from 2023. \n \nReleases: Hudson has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His arms hang uncrossed \nat either side of his front knee.  \nHudson takes an extra step with his back foot or rocks off the foot before rolling off his front foot. During the first four \ngames I watched of the 2023 season, he doesn’t sink into his stance enough, but he comes off the line with his pads over \nhis knees and sprints hard up his stem. Against Cincinnati, Hudson sinks deep into his stance and rolls off the front foot \nwithout wasted movement.  \nHudson’s read step is sudden and he has notable acceleration when he gets a clean release lane. His double up is sudden \nand he uses it to steal a release in the running game. He has a two-quick and stick combination to steal a release. He also \nuses a double up and a wipe counter that’s effective.  \nHis two-quick and shed counter get him outside. His hip shift is sudden and effective against off coverage.  \nHudson has pacing variation with his hesitation to set up a release to the inside. He has a shed counter that has good \nviolence when working the top of his stems into fade routes.  \nHis foot-switch and double up combo at the line can keep a defender inside.  \nAt the top of stems, Hudson has an effective trigger step that he sets up with good pace variation. He pairs two-quicks in \nsuccession effectively on fades.  \nHis footwork has patience and suddenness.  \nSeparation: Hudson has the acceleration to beat cornerbacks within the first 10-15 yards of the line of scrimmage and \nmaintain that separation for the length of the route—even in the deep range of the field.  \nHe stacks defenders once he earns separation. He can outrun cornerbacks tight to him after the catch and cover 50-plus \nyards.  \nRoute Stems: Hudson will dive inside to set up routes. He’ll also widen and work into the feet of the defender.  \nRoute Setups: Hudson has an effective in-set to set up out-breaking routes and vertical routes where he takes the back of \nthe defender. He’ll take the back of a defender after diving inside early in the stem. He delivers a peek after taking the back \nof the coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Hudson finishes friendly and gets his head around quickly on stop routes. He snaps his turns on stop routes. \nHe has a three-quick break, and he has developed a long break step. He also developed weight drop with this route when \nrunning shorter routes. This is an improvement from 2023. \n\n \n216 \nHudson will work to the open area when his first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nHudson has speed breaks with a flat line step. The break step and drive steps need to become more pronounced and \nprecise. They are precise when facing tight man coverage and running short speed outs. \nHe runs out his breaks and the turns work back--even if only a little on some routes—back to the quarterback. \nZone Routes: Hudson identifies the coverage, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly finish to his \nbody position to the quarterback. He’ll also tempo his breaks across zones. When he works vertical routes against zone, \nhe’ll wait to show his eyes until he has closed the buzz or rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Hudson can toe-tap or drag the back foot to keep the play inbounds.   \nPass Tracking: Hudson tracks the ball over his shoulder. He adjusts his stride and position to underthrown targets. He can \nextend his arms to helmet level and catch the ball over his shoulder without leaving his feet while breaking toward the \nboundary.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Hudson catches targets arriving over his shoulder with underhand technique. He uses overhand \ntechnique for targets at shoulder height. He can reach behind his break point to catch the ball at his back shoulder while \nbreaking across the middle.  \nHis hands can be too wide apart as he extends them and it leads to him clap-attacking targets and dropping them. It seems \nto be isolated to slants.   \nHe can catch the ball underhand at the numbers and take a hard hit to his back. He will high-point jump through targets \nwith overhand position. Hudson can also reach below his knees on the run and snare the ball. He’ll also dig out low throws.  \nPosition: Hudson will execute a pull back to get his back to the oncoming defender. He also embraces the fall in these \nsituations. Hudson has good timing with his jump through on vertical routes that are underthrown.  \nFocus: Hudson can take hard contact to his back.   \nTransitions: Hudson catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: Hudson can layer moves in succession to avoid multiple defenders in space. He can stop-start, jump cut, and \nspin away from pursuit angles and can perform these moves in succession.  \nVision: Hudson has a good gauge of various angles of pursuit—backside, front side, from behind and over the top. He can \ncreate space against multiple defenders. He’ll press pursuit with a head fake or lean before bouncing around a block that his \npress set up. He manages game scripts, downing himself late in contests when targeted over the middle so he can conserve \ntime for his offense.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Hudson stalemates contact to his torso from cornerbacks with a runway.  \nPower: Hudson uses the stiff arm to swat away reaches to his frame. He can pull through reaches to his lower legs.  \nBall Security: Hudson carries the ball high to his chest. Even when avoiding defenders and making moves in succession, \nHudson switches the ball from one arm to the other.  \nBlocking: He’ll wall off his assignment as a backside blocker on a perimeter play. He shuffles his feet and moves well \nlaterally while maintaining a square position with his knees and hips bent.  \nHe is quick to earn position or a strike on a defender with Most Dangerous Man assignments. He has a bad habit of leading \nwith his head down and overextending, which tips off his position and leads to missing his target.  \nHudson delivers his hands hard, but he’s overextending and jabbing instead of closing the gap and delivering an uppercut. \nHis hands are often too wide when he closes the gap effectively. He must develop a punch and close the gap tighter if he \nhopes to establish and maintain control with his blocks.  \nWhen he closes the gap, he can wall off opponents with his elbows bent and a square-squat stance. He keeps his feet \nmoving once engaged.  \n\n \n217 \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Hudson will pop in camp with his vertical game, but any conversation about him as a \nlegitimate sleeper is immaterial until he displays better breaks and a one-on-one game on timing routes working back to the \nquarterback. If that becomes a consistent drumbeat, the buzz will have substance. In light of this information, consider \nHudson a late-round option in leagues with 6-8 rounds, or a player to monitor until you hear that specific drumbeat about \nhis development.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nQuick, stack, layers moves \n• \nPositioning – jump through, pull back \n• \nClap-attack Slant \n• \nClap-attack post \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n218 \nWR Da’Quan Felton RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR39 \nJersey: No.9 \nHeight/Weight: 6’5”/213 School: Virginia Tech/Norfolk St.  \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Nico Collins - - Jauan Jennings/X - - Osirus Mitchell \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 79.2 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nVanderbilt ‘24 \n• \nStanford ‘24 \n• \nGa. Tech ‘24 \n• \nSyracuse ‘24 \n• \nClemson ‘24 \n• \nUVA ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Felton makes difficult catches in several games and wins the ball against contact and tight coverage at \nodd angles from his frame. He also clap-attacks and drops targets he should catch. If he shores up the clap-attacks he could \nbecome an elite pass-catcher.  \n \nFelton is a physical receiver who lacks the bend we see from the player at the top of his comparison archetype, Nico Collins. \nFelton’s executes setups well, but his breaks must become sharper for him to win against man coverage on timing routes.  \n \nOtherwise, Felton’s value could be restricted to zone or size mismatches on angle routes that break to the boundary or \nacross the field.  \n \nThere’s some clap-attacking to his receiving game that could hurt him if he doesn’t get it under control. Even so, he’s an \neffective ball-winner against tight coverage and contact.  \n \nAfter the catch, Felton is a nimble and agile runner despite lacking explosive change of direction. His footwork, size, and \ncontact balance make him a good runner in open space.  \n \nFelton might be a late-round pick, but he’s one that could emerge in a role we’ve seen from the likes of Tim Patrick or Jauan \nJennings. \n \nReleases: Felton uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His knees are slightly bent. \nHis arms hang at either side of his front knee.  \nFelton comes off the line with no wasted motion, rolling off the front foot. He could sink into his stance before his release. \nHe gets his pads over his knees and he pumps his arms.  \nFelton uses a hesitation or feet switch to steal a release in the run game. He combines the hesitation with a two-quick. He \nuses a double up to earn and inside release against an off-coverage zone defender playing with a tight cushion.  \nOn fade routes, Felton uses a two-quick at the top of the stem and counters with a wipe or a double swat. He has a read-\nstep to set up crossing routes. He also uses the read step and a swat counter to work inside and set up a sail route.  \nFelton uses a stick and a shoulder reduction counter to work across the face of a defender on a shallow cross or \nintermediate over route. He has a good swat-swim counter at the top of stems on slants.  \nHis moves are sudden.  \nSeparation: Felton has the speed to get 1-2 steps on a press-man corner up the boundary. He will stack an outside shade \ndefender with a release inside.  \nRoute Stems: Felton dives inside with his stems. He’ll also run at the defender or widen.  \nRoute Setups: Felton uses an inset to sell the outside shade defender to the inside before taking the defender’s back at the \nbreak on the sail route. Felton stairsteps routes and that can influence multiple defenders.  \n\n \n219 \nFelton uses a peek at the top of stems where he dives inside and the sells the peek with a stick  \nRoute Breaks: Felton has a drop and pop break with some weight drop in the shallow range of the field. He squares the \ntarget at the break.  \nFelton has a three-step break with a long break step. The weight drop isn’t deep enough.  \nWhen Felton’s break doesn’t earn him a target, he works toward an open area to create a friendly target. Felton drops his \nweight effectively into whip routes.  \nWhen breaking inside, Felton gets his head around to the quarterback and runs away from the defender.  \nFelton drifts out of speed breaks because he lacks a flat drive step when the break is inside the numbers and a shallow \nroute. When the break is outside the numbers and an intermediate route, the there’s a long break step with a flat drive step \nand a flat line step, breaking back to the ball.  \nZone Routes: Felton identifies the second-level defender and the zone triangle. He works to depth and settles into the \nopen area with a friendly target. He also knows when to show his eyes to the quarterback and tempo breaks when working \nvertically between zones.  \nRoute Boundary: Felton can drag both feet at the boundary when extending fully for the ball.  \nPass Tracking: Felton doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets above his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Felton turns behind his break path and catches the ball at his back hip with underhand position.  \nWhen he attacks with overhand position above his helmet, he is prone to clap-attacking and dropping the football. When \nattacking at the numbers, his hands are tighter. His underhand attack with targets at his knees is too wide and he clap-\nattacks. \nFelton digs out low throws with underhand position while sliding to the ground.  \nPosition: He can high-point with a defender’s hand in his chest, execute a pull back, and embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Felton can earn a target with overhand position or underhand position while taking a wrap to his back. He can also \ntake hard contact to his back with targets behind his break path with overhand position.  \nTransitions: Felton catches and pierces downhill. He obeys the direction of the ball to dictate his transitions.  \nElusiveness: Felton can hurdle low shots to his feet. He also lifts his feet while maintaining his stride. \nFelton spins off contact to extend for extra yardage. He has an effective stick to dip away from unblocked defenders. He \nonly needs two steps to transition downhill at the far sideline.   \nVision: Felton gets north south in traffic once he creates an open lane with movement—even if it’s a small lane. He is \nconservative about risk in the red zone. He can create in tight space and set up defenders in blockers with small presses.  \nPower: Felton uses a stiff arm to set up his spin. He extends forward through lower-body wraps to earn additional yardage. \nHe can drag middle linebackers wrapped around his waist and maintain his feet through multiple wraps so teammates can \nrally to him. He’ll drop his pads and extend forward for yardage he can get.  \nHe splits defenders with low pad level.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Felton can bounce off glancing shots to his frame from an off-ball linebacker or safety in the \nopen field.  \nBall Security: Felton carries the ball tight to his chest. His elbow is loose from his side. He’s prone to carrying the ball \nunder his right arm even when working up the left boundary. He has reps where he tucks the ball to his left arm at the left \nboundary, but the first time I saw it was after four games. He can withstand rips at the ball-carrying arm.  \n\n \n220 \nBlocking: He moves his feet well laterally, maintaining a square position to the assignment. He can seal the inside against \na safety with tight position of his pads and hands on the shoulder of the defender. He keeps the position tight with his \nelbows bent. His stance is squat, wide, and square.  \nFelton is good at taking the inside or outside shoulder of assignments to seal the side of the side of the field as necessary \nfor the play. He sustains contact against cornerbacks because of his position and his hands.  \nFelton also redirects quickly and accurately as an edge blocker, taking the defender where he wants to go and using that \nmomentum to the defender’s detriment. He does this well against safeties and off-ball linebackers. Linebackers can \ngenerate a downhill push and move Felton into the lap of the running back, but he can turn them away from the ball carrier. \n‘Felton can at least shield and provide a square obstacle for defensive ends when he’s in a tight alignment.  \nFelton transitions well from receiver to blocker, running off the defender and then tilting into the opponent and shielding \nhim from the leaking runner.  \nFelton can overrun or miss angles on assignments, but he doesn’t get up and has regained position as the play developed.  \nDurability: No significant time missed due to injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: In drafts with 7-9 rounds, Felton is worth a late pick. Otherwise, consider him when your \nrosters expand during the preseason. He might be worth stashing on your practice squad.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDives Stem, Stair-Steps, Catch Low and Behind Break, Speed \n• \nSells Vertical, Break Step, Drop and Pop, High-Point with Feet on Ground \n• \nHigh-Point, Tight Coverage, Pull-Back, Embrace the Fall \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n221",
        "analysis": "**Kobe Hudson (WR38)**\n\n* **Strengths:** Excellent ball tracker, productive at the boundary, good hands (though prone to widening them, leading to drops), elusive runner with dynamic open-field movement, effective route setups (especially using pace variation and trigger steps), good acceleration for initial separation, can win against tight coverage and contact,  understands zone coverage well. Shows improved route breaks from 2023.  Possesses a variety of effective release techniques.\n* **Opportunities:** Improve route precision, particularly breaks and drive steps to consistently create separation at all levels of the field.

Eliminate the \"clap-attacking\" that leads to drops. Needs to improve consistency in ball security and demonstrate more reliable transitions after the catch.\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** Nico Collins (lacks Collins' bend), Jauan Jennings, Osirus Mitchell, Tim Patrick.  His profile suggests a role as a big-bodied receiver who excels in contested catches and contributes in the run game as a blocker.  He might be more similar to a role player like Tim Patrick or Jauan Jennings than a featured receiver like Nico Collins.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR40 \nJersey No. 14 / No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/188 School: Auburn / Ga. State \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Randall Cobb - - Jalen Nailor/X – - Shi Smith \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.7 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nCharlotte ‘23 \n• \nTroy ’23  \n• \nGa. Southern ‘23 \n• \nLSU ‘23 \n• \nCal ‘24 \n• \nMissouri ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: After watching Lewis at Georgia State and then at Auburn, I wonder if his draft stock would have been \ndifferent if he transferred somewhere other than Auburn? I thought Auburn underutilized Lewis.  \n \nThere may be details that support how Auburn approached their use of Lewis. I didn’t’ see evidence of it on the field.  \n \nLewis is a quick-twitch athlete with compelling route skills, reliable hands, and he’s dangerous after the catch. He has some \nartistry with his releases, stems, and breaks you don’t see from a lot of prospects.  \n \nBecause of his open-field prowess as a runner, he could compete for a return role early in his career. This could gain him a \nfoothold on an active roster because he has a fundamentally sound receiving and route game to build on.  \n \nLewis can help a team as a fourth or fifth receiver and potentially develop into capable slot or flanker with big-play ability.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Lewis played split end at GSU. At Auburn he alternated between split end and the slot.  \nReleases: Lewis has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest uncrossed on \nhis front knee. When Lewis begins his break, he sinks into his stance. His pads come over his knees as he rolls off his front \nleg without wasted motion. He generates complete range of motion with his arms as he drives off the line.  \nLewis uses a hesitation and counters with a shoulder reduction to get outside a defender playing tight man-to-man with \ninside leverage. He’ll use this combination to steal a release in the running game.  \nLewis combines a hesitation with a double up and counters with a shoulder reduction. He leans a lot on the shoulder \nreduction when working outside a defender. He counters a jam at the line with a shoulder reduction and swat.  \nLewis is patient into his approach into a sudden hip shift against man coverage. He uses a two-quick and a stick as a combo \ninto the top of his stem on a speed out.  \nLewis has a capable read step and swim or wipe. His read step has a patient but sudden application. He can pair the read \nstep with a double up and the double up is the sudden part after a patient read step. Lewis can counter off this footwork \ncombination with a blade release.  \nLewis counters the hands of a defender with a shed when working to the outside. He uses the shed counter well off a hard \nstep at the top of a stem of a short fin route (quick in-breaker).  \nHe has a capable trigger step on RPOs and screens.  \nSeparation: Lewis has the speed to beat cornerbacks in the deep game and pull away from them after the catch—flipping \nthe field and breaking away. He will stack a cornerback within the first 10 yards of the line.  \nRoute Stems: Lewis attacks his stems at full speed. He dives inside against inside leverage and widen outside leverage. \nLewis will also run at the defender. When it’s given, he’ll take the back of a defender.  \n\n \n222 \nRoute Setups: Lewis has a good inset with weight drop and head fake and turn to the inside. Lewis sells the stutter-and-go \nwith a good false break—dropping the pads, head, and generating some weight drop. There’s a suddenness to the fake, \nespecially with the head and shoulders that baits opposing defenders. \nLewis uses a stair-step to set up in-breaking routes against outside leverage. He sells the peek to the fade at the top of \nstems with a head fake to the outside. The fake is sudden but he could improve it bye prolonging the movement. Even so, \nthe pace and line of his stem is good enough for the face to turn the safety.  \nRoute Breaks: Lewis has a three-step break with excellent weight drop at the top of his stems, and he works back to the \nquarterback. He generates a friendly target.  \nLewis has a flat line step out of a three-step break when breaking inside or outside. His drive step is flat when running a \nshallow speed out. He has a long break step into pop and drop breaks.  \nHe gets his head to the quarterback out of breaks. When Lewis’ first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to the open area.  \nLewis also has an effective false-acceleration break where he snap his turn as he takes two break steps and works inside-\nout. Lewis doesn’t do this with every opportunity, but he can punch the boundary-side arm back to earn snap with his turns \non breaks.  \nZone Routes: Lewis identifies the second-level defender, he works to depth, and settles into the open area. He creates an \nopen target.  \nRoute Boundary: Lewis is aware of the boundary and he’ll drag his feet when tracking high and over his shoulder.  \nPass Tracking: Lewis tracks the ball over his shoulder on vertical routes with is back to the quarterback and with short out \nroutes. He executes attacks with late hands against coverage. He can make one-handed catches against tight coverage at \nhis hip with underhand attack over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lewis attacks the ball with overhand position at the numbers. He uses underhand position and can \ncatch below the knees. He’ll also extend wide with underhand position as he tracks the ball over his shoulder on vertical \nroutes.  \nHe has the occasional focus drop when the flash of an oncoming defender distracts him, and this can lead to a clap-attack \nand drop. He can high-point and take contact to his back.  \nPosition: Lewis embraces the fall when extending for a targets costs him is balance. He has an effective pull back when \ncatching targets with a defender approaching his chest.  \nFocus: Lewis earns the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage at his back. He can take a hard shot to his back or his \nchest as he catches a target.  \nTransitions: Lewis catches and pierces to get downhill.  \nElusiveness: Lewis has an effective spin in traffic to avoid pursuit over the top after splitting defenders. He also uses the \nspin to work off hits. Lewis has curvilinear speed and can transition downhill from a perimeter approach with no prep-steps.  \nVision: Lewis will split defenders in the open field and create in the open field. He uses the stick to press an unblocked \ndefender and then cut against the grain of the opponent’s pursuit.  \nPower: He pulls through reaches to his frame. He uses a stiff-arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He uses a forearm \nshiver to bounce off glancing shots. \nHe keeps his feet moving through contact. He pulls through upper-body wraps.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Lewis bounces off glancing shots from small off-ball linebackers (safety size) and cornerbacks.  \nBall Security: Lewis tucks the ball high to his frame. By habit, Lewis carries the ball under his right arm. However, I have \nseen him use his left arm up the left boundary. He can take a hit to his ball-carrying arm.  \n\n \n223 \nBlocking: Lewis is a patient stalk blocker who waits to close his position with the defender. He works inside to get a flat \nlead and delivers and uppercut with both hands into the chest of the defender.  \nLewis earns a square and squat position. He keeps his feet moving after contact to remain square.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Lewis from afar pre-draft. Post-draft? If he’s selected inside the sixth round, \nLewis could be worth a roster spot in the deepest leagues. Otherwise, watch for news that gives you reason to add him to \nan expanded preseason roster.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSet-Up, Tracking, and YAC \n• \nVertical Tracking and Embraces the Fall \n• \nSinks into Release, Sells Vertical, Hard Break, and Catch vs. Contact \n• \nPress and Bounce, Curvilinear Speed, and Pad Level \n• \nWidens Stem, Snap + 2, High-Point vs. Contact \n• \nGeorgia State Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n224",
        "analysis": "Robert Lewis is a quick-twitch, versatile receiver with excellent route-running skills and reliable hands.  His open-field running ability makes him a potential return specialist, giving him a path to an NFL roster.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Exceptional route technician with diverse releases (hesitation, shoulder reduction, double up), stems, and breaks.  Shows patience and suddenness in his movements, creating separation.

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR41 \nJersey No.1 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/200 School: Arizona State / Idaho State \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Grant DuBose - X – Isiah McKoy – T.J. Simmons – Adrian Hardy \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.7 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nTexas Tech ‘24 \n• \nBYU ‘24 \n• \nArizona ‘24 \n• \nIowa State ‘24 \n• \nTexas ‘25 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Looking for a smaller Mack Hollins? Guillory could become that special teams ace who can also \ncontribute in a passing game when called upon.  \n \nGuillory has reliable hands, and he is a physical runner after the catch with good footwork and patience in traffic. Guillory \nalso plays bigger than he is. He lacks advanced route work, but he could contribute early as an outlet receiver and on \ncrossers, over routes, and the occasional seam route.  \n \nGuillory shines as a blocker. He works with intensity and sustains his efforts. Put him in an offense like the Chiefs and he \ncould have a supporting role with the ground game, as a stalk blocker, and an outlet receiver.  \n \nIt’s likely Guillory, like Hollins, will have more indirect value for an NFL team than direct value to the box score. Still, there’s \nsome playmaking ability at the catch point and vertical prowess worth keeping an eye on.  \n \nGuillory’s physicality, timely plays, and versatility could endear him to coaches and give him opportunities to shine in a \ncontributing role that’s consistent and productive. \n \nHe’s a sleeper. If I had a category for sleepers, Guillory would be in it.  \n \nReleases: Guillory has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side \nof his front foot. He rolls off the front foot during his release after he rocks off his back foot.  \nGuillory has routes where he sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. These reps are the \nexception rather than the rule. \nHis pads can be lower as he releases, but he gets them over his front foot. His arms move at one-third to one-half of their \nmaximum range.  \nHe uses a read step to attack inside leverage and then release outside. He counters with a wipe. He’ll also steal a release \nwith the read step, a double up, feet-switch, or a two-quick.  \nGuillory counters his read step with a swat at the top of a stem. He delivers a stick with a shoulder reduction counter to the \noutside leverage defender. He also counters inside leverage with a shed.  \nGuillory has an effective double up at the top of his stem against off-coverage.  \nSeparation: Guillory can easily beat a safety up the seam when the safety is playing a deep cushion. He can stack \ndefensive backs on intermediate and vertical routes (15-40 yards) with a vertical stem. \nRoute Stems: Guillory will widen his stems against outside leverage and take the back of the defender. He’ll also run at the \ndefender until he reaches the top of his stem. \nHe’ll dive his stems against off coverage. When the route breaks inside, it would be wise to stair step the off-coverage \ndefender to set up the break. He doesn’t do this right now.  \n\n \n225 \nRoute Setups: Guillory will give a peek outside to set up a break inside.  \nRoute Breaks: Guillory has a three-step break with weight drop. He has a long break step into a drop and pop break with \nweight drop.  \nGuillory’s speed breaks can be flatter when he’s running at strong pace. His drive step is flat, but the line step is prone to \ndrifting and it can cost him a step back to the ball, especially with routes breaking tight to the boundary. Still, Guillory has \nshown as his career as progressed that he can deliver a long break step with weight drop that transitions into flat drive and \nline steps on out routes. When breaking inside, his breaks have been flatter without these lapses. \nZone Routes: Guillory identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and works across zones. He waits to show his \neyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. \nAlthough Guillory tempos breaks across open spaces of zones, he can be quicker to identify when his quarterback is \nbreaking the pocket and adjust his break to work with the quarterback.  \nHe could make impactful plays in wide open zones if he stops and reverses field in the open area sooner. Instead, he waits \nuntil he closes on a zone defender and must reverse his field as the quarterback is already outside the pocket to the \nopposite side of the field.  \nRoute Boundary: Guillory can tap and drag his feet inbounds on out-breaking routes.  \nPass Tracking: Guillory doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets. He uses the appropriate attack based on the \ntrajectory of the ball. He’ll track the ball over his shoulder with overhand position.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Guillory can catch the ball at his back shoulder while crossing the middle of the field with overhand \nposition. He can extend wide of his frame and earn the ball with overhand position.  \nGuillory can highpoint targets no over routes. He catches behind his break path with overhand attack.  \nWhen working a slant that arrives at his beltline, Guillory uses underhand attack.  \nPosition: Guillory embraces the fall when extending away from his frame to earn a target. He delivers a pull back after \nhigh-pointing.  \nFocus: Guillory can take contact to his back from coverage tight to his back as he catches the ball over the middle. He \ntakes glancing shots to his chest as he catches a target over the middle.  \nGuillory also takes contact to his chest as a defender tries to cut off a slant. \nTransitions: Guillory will catch and pierce. He obeys the path off the ball.  \nElusiveness: Guillory only needs two quick steps to transition from an east-west runway to a downhill runway. He can spin \noff or away from contact.  \nVision: Guillory will split defenders downfield to finish strong as a runner. He will press unblocked defenders into blockers \nand execute cutbacks or bounces.  \nPower: Guillory will drop his pads and keep his feet moving through wraps to his upper body. He will carry multiple \ndefenders wrapped around his torso. He pulls through reaches.  \nGuillory pulls through reaches to his lower legs. He uses the stiff arm to swat past reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Guillory can bounce off a glancing hit to his side from a linebacker, a safety, or a cornerback. \nBall Security: Guillory can carry the ball close to his chest with his elbow loose from his frame. He’ll keep the ball away \nfrom the nearest pursuit.  \nBlocking: Guillory has an urgency as a run blocker with Man Over Me assignments. He moves his feet quickly with choppy \nsteps. He closes the gap well with defenders he’s stalking at various cushions of distance from the line of scrimmage. \n\n \n226 \nHe has a wide balanced stance at the point of contact. He moves well laterally. When he uses uppercut motion for his strike \nagainst corners on Man Over Me assignments, he sustains contact.  \nRegardless of the strike type—uppercut or jab—he strikes with intensity. If he rolled through his hips, he could enhance his \noverall game because the power he’d generate with the strike.  \nGuillory works his hands tight into the chest of the opponent. \nGuillory earns a flat lead to square and strike a linebacker in the middle of the field. His strikes are jabs and he lessens his \nodds of sustaining contact with these Most Dangerous Man assignments.  \nGuillory is the type of blocker who will work from an assignment to the line of scrimmage and chase downfield to take on \npursuit over the top of the runner.

        "analysis": "Xavier Guillory is a WR prospect projected as a late-round pick or priority free agent.  His profile suggests a player whose value lies more in his special teams contributions and blocking ability than in high-volume receiving stats.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Physicality and Blocking:** Guillory's most significant strength is his physicality. He's a highly effective blocker, showing intensity, sustained effort, and the ability to take on larger defenders.  He excels in run blocking and as a stalk blocker.\n* **Reliable Hands and After-Catch Ability:** He possesses reliable hands and demonstrates good footwork and patience, allowing him to make plays after the catch. He's described as playing bigger than his size.\n* **Versatility:**  He can contribute as an outlet receiver, running crossers, over routes, and occasional seam routes. This versatility makes him attractive to coaching staffs.\n* **Special Teams Potential:**  The comparison to Mack Hollins highlights his potential as a standout special teams player.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:**  While his route running isn't advanced, there's room for improvement.  Developing more sophisticated route techniques would significantly increase his offensive value.\n* **Increased Production in Open Zones:** His zone route running needs improvement in terms of his reaction time and decision-making in open spaces. Improving this aspect could lead to more big plays.\n* **NFL System Fit:** Landing in an offense that values blocking and special teams, such as the Chiefs, would maximize his potential contribution.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Elite Speed or Agility:** While he's physical, he's not described as possessing exceptional speed or agility, limiting his potential as a deep threat.\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  His route running needs significant work to be considered a starting-caliber receiver.\n* **Injury History:** A season-ending foot injury and a hamstring injury raise concerns about his durability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparisons (Grant DuBose, Isiah McKoy, T.J. Simmons, Adrian Hardy) are not widely known NFL players, making it difficult to ascertain a strong parallel.  The Mack Hollins comparison is more insightful, suggesting a player who provides more value through special teams and blocking than as a primary receiver.  Hollins is a good benchmark for understanding Guillory's potential role.  He's likely a depth player who contributes significantly on special teams and as a versatile blocker.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR42 \nJersey No. 8 \nHeight/Weight: 6’3”/200 School: Cincinnati / Florida \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Andrei Iosivas - X – Austin Watkins, Jr. \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.2 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nPitt ’24  \n• \nTexas Tech ‘24 \n• \nArizona State ‘24 \n• \nColorado ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Henderson could be one of those ugly duckling prospects who transforms into a swan. Although he’s \nfast, his movements can appear awkward – as if he’s on the verge of teetering over -- but he still remains in control.  \n \nHenderson has the tools to deliver releases, setups, and breaks. He must develop greater artistry and controlled movement \nwith his route game. If Henderson can learn to deliver this artistry and control at full speed, he’ll have a man-to-man game \nthat will hold up in the NFL against starting cornerbacks.  \n \nHenderson does a lot of good work as a pass-catcher, but he has lapses with clap-attacking, using the correct attack, and \npositioning himself to keep the opponent from making a play on the ball. Although this sounds like a lot, these lapses are \ncouched between successful work with catchable targets that require good body control and toughness against contact.  \n \nAfter the catch, Henderson attacks downfield and he’s a physical finisher for his size. He bends around pursuit effectively \nand plays with pacing to set up rushing lanes.  \n  \nIt may take 2-3 years for Henderson to emerge. Even so, that emergency may remain limited to a contributing role as a \nfourth or fifth option.  \n \nStill, there’s something about his game that intrigues me. If he can maximize his development potential, he might have be \nthe next Kendrick Bourne. Hopefully, without injury.  \n \nConceptual: If Henderson was better at earning position against defensive backs on fades to the boundary, he’s game \nwould be more compelling for the NFL.  \nReleases: Henderson has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front leg. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee. When he doesn’t sink as deep into his stance, Henderson comes off the line with his pads over his \nknees and no wasted motion. His arms move at one-third to half their full range of motion.  \nAgainst press coverage, he sinks into his stance, but rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front foot. He sinks into his \nstance to get his pads over his knees.  \nHenderson uses a two-quick to the outside to steal a release. He counters the defender’s hands during an outside release \nwith a shed or a wipe.  \nHe has a patient but sudden combo of a read step and double up against outside leverage. He counters with a wipe. This is \nthe only patient but sudden execution I’ve seen from him.  \nHenderson uses a swat-swim against tight coverage to his inside at the top of a stem. He uses a read step to the outside or \na feet-switch to set up a crosser.  \nHe’ll reduce his shoulder from defenders as he works outside of them. He’ll often use the shoulder reduction as a counter to \na defender’s hands after delivering a double up. Henderson uses both moves to steal a release in the running game.  \nSeparation: Henderson has the speed to beat an outside shade defender on a vertical stem without a safety over the top. \nHe can stack a defender at the top of stem on a fade or go.  \n\n \n228 \nHe can beat the backside pursuit of a cornerback to flip the field 35-40 yards.  \nRoute Stems: Against outside leverage on a vertical route, Henderson will widen his stem toward the defender late in the \nstem. He’ll dive against inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: In addition to widening the stem late in a vertical route, Henderson will give a peek to the boundary to sell \nthe fade. He also has a hip shift that veers into the back of the defender who is turning and running just ahead with outside \nleverage.  \nHenderson uses an inset near the boundary at the top of his stem, turning his head and pads inside before using a wipe to \nwork downfield and stacking the defender.  \nHenderson stair-steps zone routes breaking across the middle.  \nRoute Breaks: Henderson has a drop and pop break with weight drop but no break step. He creates a friendly target to the \nball out his break. He snaps his head around on slants.  \nHenderson has a long break step into a three-step break with weight drop. The whole process can have more suddenness. \nHe must attack the stem faster. He also uses a three-step break without a long break step, and he’ll work back to the ball.  \nWith shallow speed outs, he has flat drive and line steps.  \nWhen it comes to his break technique, Henderson looks like he’s running on ice. His steps lack the precision, steadiness, \nand balance seen from NFL receivers and he doesn’t run many of these stems at full speed. When he reaches the top of his \nstems, he seems teetering on the edge of losing control This could just be the way he moves, but that’s what I see from \nhim.  \nZone Routes: Henderson identifies the second and third-level defenders, works to depth, and settles in the open area, \ntempoing his break pace to stay open near the boundary. He doesn’t show his eyes until he has cleared the buzz/rollover \ndefender.  \nRoute Boundary: Henderson can get both feet inbounds after high-pointing a ball and taking a hit to his back. He also toe-\ntaps for targets wide from his frame and near the boundary.  \nWhen he runs fades to the boundary, he should maintain more space between himself and the boundary so he has  more \nflexibility to adjust to the target and the defensive back. He can give up opportunities to prevent defensed passes and \ninterceptions. This has happened in multiple games.  \nPass Tracking: Henderson tracks the ball over his shoulder and with overhand technique high and wide of his frame as the \ntarget leads him downfield. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for a target.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Henderson makes leaping underhand attacks with a defender tight to him. He can high-point the \nball. He has lapses where he clap-attacks high-points and the ball squirts through his hands. \nHe extends wide of his frame for targets with an overhand attack. He can catch the ball away from his frame when the ball \nis arriving at his numbers.  \nPosition: Henderson does everything right on a vertical route to stack and earn position on a defender inside and at his \nback hip until it’s time to make the catch. He cuts off the defender works back to the ball but doesn’t jump up and through \nwith high-point attack. He jumps straight into the air but uses underhand position and allow the ball into his frame. \nHenderson will embrace the fall after executing a pullback to turn away from the defender.  \nFocus: Henderson can make a leaping underhand catch with a defender wrapping his back. He can take hit to his back as \nhe lands after high-pointing a target. Henderson can dig out low throws with a defender wrapping him from behind as he \ndoes so.  \nHenderson can also take a hard shot hit to his legs and chest as he high-points the ball.  \nTransitions: Henderson adheres to catch and pierce principles with receptions facing the quarterback.  \n\n \n229 \nElusiveness: Henderson can bend away from a high safety and accelerate past to the opposite side of the field. He has \nsmall jump cuts and a tight spin that are effective. He plays with pacing effectively. He only needs two quick steps to \ntransition downhill from a perimeter path.  \nVision: Henderson runs to open space and he can press downhill to set up a high safety so he can bend around the \nopponent. He handles unanticipated shots.  \nPower: Henderson keeps his feet moving through contact and can stay on his feet when wrapped high by multiple \ndefenders. He can give teammates an opportunity to rally toward him. When one cornerback wraps Henderson, he can carry \nthat defender for 5-7 yards on his back.  \nHenderson drops his pads to split defenders in the open field and bounces off their glancing shots while keeping his feet \nmoving.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Henderson splits hits to his side from linebackers and safeties and maintains his balance.  \nBall Security: Henderson tucks the ball under his right arm at the left boundary – even when turning outside pursuit and \nworking along the sideline. He tucks the ball high too his chest.  \nA hard shot to the ball-carrying arm can dislodge the ball.  \nBlocking: Henderson keeps his hands tight and shoots into the defender’s chest plate with an uppercut motion, but no hip \nroll with the punch. He keeps his feet moving but doesn’t close the gap between himself and the Man Over Me assignment.  \nWhen executing Most Dangerous Man assignments, Henderson earns a flat lead but overextends to the safety and tips off \nhis intentions. He’ll also overextend by leading with his side and inside pad. It’s not even forceful so the bump does nothing \nto change the safety’s position in the running lane.  \nHenderson will run off a cornerback on a screen pass to his side of the field. He tilts into the defender and locks into the \ndefender’s chest while moving his feet to move with the defender’s momentum and keep the defender’s back to the ball \ncarrier.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Henderson from afar, but be prepared to make him a speculative addition for your \nexpanded summer roster if he looks good in camp. If he makes a roster, Henderson could also be worth a practice squad \nstash in deep leagues.   \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nInset/Wipe Combo, Stack, Position, Jump Up and Through, No Highpoint  \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n230 \nWR Dont’e Thornton, Jr. RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR43 \nJersey No. 1  \nHeight/Weight: 6’5”/205 School: Tennessee/Oregon \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Christian Watson – David White/X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 77.4 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nUtah ‘22 \n• \nFlorida ‘23 \n• \nOklahoma ‘24 \n• \nAlabama ‘24 \n• \nMississippi State ‘24 \n• \nVanderbilt ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Thornton looks better on paper than he does on film, but the film is compelling enough for Thornton to \nhave a bright future. NFL decision-makers love tall receivers with 4.3-second, 40-Yard speed and Thornton delivers checks \nto those boxes.  \n \nSoon, it must translate better to the field. Thornton must correct his attack of the football. He frequently uses a hands \nposition where the hands bookend the ball side-by-side.  \n \nThis is a difficult method of attack, because it greatly increases the chances of fighting the ball or miss-timing it completely \nand the ball flying between the receiver’s hands.  \n \nThornton is also prone to tracking the ball over a shoulder that’s not optimal for the trajectory of the route. Ultimately, this \nmakes Thornton’s job more difficult.  \n \nBeing 6’5” and running a 4.3-second, 40-Yard Dash should be advantages to build on for a vertical receiver. However, the \nvertical game is already a low-percentage region to throw the ball. Poor tracking and clap-attacking only makes the job \ntougher.  \n \nThornton must develop a better release game. Without it, he will continue to play slower on the field than he looks running \nsprints. Thornton’s range of motion with his footwork isn’t believable.  \n \nThornton’s pacing to set up defenders good, but he must develop a complementary short and intermediate game so \ndefenders can’t overcompensate to take away the vertical shots. At this point, Thornton doesn’t drop his weight nearly \nenough to win breaks back to the quarterback. If he doesn’t fix this, opponents can play off Thornton and still cut off the \ntarget.  \n \nThornton has good footwork and movement after the catch. He moves slower than one would expect.  \n \nThornton could earn an early role as a situational deep threat if he can also show something in the RPO and screen game. \nDon’t count on much from his as a rookie unless he earns that Kenny Golladay-Chase Claypool opportunity.  \n \nNot familiar? Think of an incomplete receiver but skilled athlete works between two excellent starters. Even as the weakest \nreceiver of the trio, the Golladay/Claypool type can earn massive mismatches and against overmatched safeties and \nlinebackers or run free in overtaxed zones.   \n \nWhere is the player inconsistent? I have minor concerns that Thornton’s not using the best shoulder to look for the ball \nbased on the fade route he’s running.  \nReleases: Thornton has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \n\n \n231 \nMost of Thornton’s releases have wasted movement—usually a rock off the back foot. There are releases where he sinks \ninto his stance and rolls off the front leg with no wasted motion. His head and shoulders are over his front knee and he \npumps his arms at about half the range of motion he could to sell the vertical potential of the route.  \nThere’s less rocking—minimal—off the back foot when he’s running a route as the primary target.  \nThornton counters the defender’s hands with a wipe or a shed. He has a double up, but the range of motion and the pace \nlack dynamic movement to force a defender off his spot. He’ll counter with a wipe.  \nThornton has a two-quick with a double-swat counter. The footwork has little range of motion or contrast between patience \nand suddenness to bait coverage.  \nThornton uses a hesitation to set up a release on a fade.  \nThornton will steal a release with a read step. His hesitation and double up combination to steal a release has an effective \ncontrast of patience and suddenness in 2024 that he hasn’t shown with any release tactics in 2022-2023.  \nHe’s also patient and sudden pair two-quick footwork to steal a release.  \nSeparation: Thornton has enough long speed to separate late from tight man coverage in the deepest ranges of the field \nand stack the defender.  \nRoute Stems: Thornton widens stems against outside leverage. \nRoute Setups: Thornton will vary the pace of stems—slowing down and speeding up- in timely fashion to set up off-\ncoverage defenders. He’ll work into the defender’s back deep into his stems on vertical routes.  \nWith vertical routes, he’ll reinforce separation with is hands during the break so he maintains the separation he earned.  \nRoute Breaks: Thornton has a drop and pop break, but he needs to deliver a longer break step, drop his weight with \nnotable depth, and snap the break fully back to the quarterback.  \nThornton has a longer break step at Tennessee, but the weight drop is still not there with the drop and pop break in 2023. \nHe finishes friendly and gets his head around to the quarterback. By 2024, Thornton showed he could drop his weight into \nthe drop and pop.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target and his quarterback is breaking the pocket, Thornton will work the scramble drill \nup the boundary and find open space—or reverse field and work to open space.  \nAt Tennessee, Thornton displayed effective weight-drop into three-step breaks. He slides back to the quarterback.  \nComing out of stems where he dives inside, Thornton has a tight drive step and line step, but this has much less \nmomentum to deal with than a speed turn. He also has a flat drive and flat line step when breaking inside on a dig where \nthe break is a three-step hard break.  \nZone Routes: Thornton identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the field, \nshowing his eyes when he passes the zone/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Thornton can toe-tap the boundary when catching targets that are at number’s-height. He can also drag \nthe feet when making sliding catches of targets near the sideline. He can high-point and toe tap near the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Thornton tracks targets over his shoulder in the vertical game against tight coverage. He can switch from \ntracking over the inside shoulder to the outside shoulder, but I have minor concerns that he’s not using the best shoulder to \nlook for the ball based on the fade route he’s running. I’ll keep watching for it.  \nThornton displays late hands. He can extend wide of his frame to track the ball over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Thornton catches targets at his knees with underhand position away from his frame. He uses \noverhand position to catch targets at the numbers.  \nThere are targets arriving at his waist where he should be using overhand or underhand attack but uses more of a side-by-\nside clap and his effectiveness with securing the ball is tenuous.  \n\n \n232 \nThornton can catch wide of his frame, including behind his break path.  \nPosition: Thornton delivers a pullback against coverage at his inside hip when tracking the ball over his inside shoulder in \nthe vertical game.  \nFocus: Thornton wins vertical targets against tight coverage making contact to his back. This includes the vertical game, \nworking back to the ball, and crossing the field.  \nTransitions: Thornton practices effective catch and pierce principles.  \nElusiveness: Thornton kicks his feet away from low shots in the open field. He has a tight enough spin move to avoid \npursuit in the middle of the field and transition downhill through the spin.  \nHis stutter steps are compact. Much of his footwork is compact and lacking dynamic range of movement. He’s at his best \nwith stop-start movement and small dips away from pursuit, hoping the pursuit will overrun its angles on him.  \nHe can layer moves in succession to make multiple defender miss. He has moves, but his quickness is a half-step less \nexplosive than you want to see for what he has in his tool box.  \nThornton can transition downhill from a perimeter approach with two quick steps.  \nVision: Thornton is decisive in open space and works to open rushing lanes away from pursuit. When he has to finish a play \nby taking on pursuit to earn extra yardage, he’ll do it. He can create space against unblocked defenders.  \nPower: Thornton uses his stiff arm to ward off reaches and set up his spin. He drops his pads into contact. \nDirect Contact Balance: He can win collisions with a cornerback.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Thornton bounces off glancing shots to his pads from cornerbacks and shots to his legs from \nsafeties in the open field.  \nBall Security: Thornton carries the ball close to his chest, but his elbow is loose from his side. The ball swings away from \nhis frame when he’s executing a dynamic movement like a spin and it has made him susceptible to strips and punch-outs.  \nHe lost control of an exchange on a reverse that led to a Utah touchdown in 2022 as an Oregon Duck. It was his second lost \nfumble of the game.  \nThornton uses the boundary-side arm when catching a target to one side of the field. If he catches the ball in the middle of \nthe field and works to the opposite side of the field, the ball remains under the arm on the side of the field where the route \nbegan.  \nBlocking: Thornton shuffles his feet with a wide stance and breaks down in a square and squat position toward the \nassignment. He delivers his hands with elbows bent and hands tight. He strikes with a double-jab motion.  \nWhen a defender is the aggressor at the point of attack, Thornton will load up one arm and deliver his elbow into his \nopponent’s chest. It’s not a balanced strike, and it doesn’t give him a chance to sustain contact but when it hits, he can \ndrop a defensive  back.  \nThornton moves his feet when he earns square contact with a defender. Although his feet, body alignment, and hands \npositions are technically sound, his strikes lack intensity and his overall effort lacks physicality. When he extends his arms \ntoward a defender in a Man Over Me situation, Thornton’s motion is deliberate rather than explosive.  \nI hate to say this way, but his movement as a blocker in 2022 and 2023 looks “dainty.” It’s as if he’s cleaning China and \ncarefully placing the dried teacups in the cabinet.  \nHis blocking looked more physical in specific games in 2024, notably early in the Alabama and Mississippi State games.  \nDurability: Thornton missed two games with a lower-body injury in 2023.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Thornton is worth a stash on expanded rosters during the offseason because he could \nearn that Golladay/Claypool mismatch role where speed and a modicum of receiving skill can generate strong production—\nat least until opposing defenses decide to shut down the party. \n\n \n233 \n \nThere’s always a chance Thornton transcends the role and becomes a legit starter, or at least an inconsistent deep threat \nwho makes good on 1 out of every 4-5 deep shots and it’s worth using as a fourth or fifth fantasy option in flex formats.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nProgression with Drop and Pop Break \n• \nImproved Release Stance/Motion, Stems at Defender, Late Hands \n• \nTennessee Highlights 2024 \n• \nOregon Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n234",
        "analysis": "**Xzavier Henderson (WR)**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Good size (6'3\", 200 lbs), speed, physical after the catch, attacks downfield, strong body control, toughness against contact, effective at bending around pursuit and setting up rushing lanes.  Possesses solid release techniques, including various counters to press coverage.  Can stack defenders on vertical routes and has decent ball tracking skills. Shows flashes of high-pointing the ball and making difficult catches in contested situations.\n* **Opportunities:**  Improve route running artistry and controlled movement, especially at full speed. Needs to refine his pass-catching technique (clap-attacking, attack angle, positioning) for greater consistency. Developing a more reliable fade route to the boundary would significantly enhance his NFL profile.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Andrei Iosivas, Austin Watkins Jr., Kendrick Bourne (potential, if development maximizes).  The comparison to Bourne highlights his potential as a versatile contributor, but suggests a path to a similar role, potentially taking a few years to develop.\n\n\n**Dont'e Thornton Jr. (WR)**\n\n* **Strengths:** Exceptional size (6'5\", 205 lbs) and speed (4.3 40-yard dash).  Good pacing to set up defenders. Shows flashes of strong vertical route running, able to separate late from tight coverage.  Effective footwork and movement after the catch (though slower than expected).  Improving release game.\n* **Opportunities:**  Significant improvement needed in ball tracking and catching technique (clap-attacking, hand placement). Needs to develop a more consistent and dynamic release game to translate speed to on-field performance. Must develop a complementary short and intermediate game to prevent defenses from solely focusing on his deep threat ability. Needs to improve weight drop in his route breaks.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Christian Watson, David White.  The comparison to Watson highlights his potential as a deep threat, but acknowledges that he needs significant development to reach that level.  The Golladay/Claypool comparison suggests a potential role as a situational deep threat, capitalizing on mismatches.  However, he's unlikely to be a consistent starter without considerable improvement.\n\n\nBoth players have intriguing physical tools but require significant refinement of their technical skills to reach their full potential in the NFL.  Their fantasy value is highly dependent on their development and ability to carve out a specific role within an NFL offense.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR44 \nJersey No. 7 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11” / 200 School: Eastern Washington \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Amon-Ra St. Brown – Sterling Shepard - X - James Proche \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 77.4 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): The games used this report came from highlight packages on YouTube. This is \nthe exceptional circumstance when I don’t have complete access to coach’s tape on a player.  \n \n• \nMontana ‘24  \n• \nMontana State ‘24  \n• \nDrake ‘24 \n• \nMonmouth ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Chism and Cooper Kupp are both Eastern Washington alumni. Both use their hands and feet expertly \nas runners in the open field. Both catch the ball well and possess more quickness than speed.  \n \nCongratulations, that’s the Kupp-Chism comp you always wanted for your pre-draft “edumacation.” Time for me to take a \nvacation. Have a nice day.  \n \nKupp is a more explosive athlete than Chism, he’s a few inches taller, and he was a far better route runner at the same \nstage of Chism’s career. It’s like comparing a 2024 Chevy Malibu (Chism) with a 1967 Chevy Chevelle Malibu SS (Kupp).  \n \nChism is more like Sterling Shepard without the long speed Shepard had early in his career. Chism will get the job done \nagainst underneath coverage and he can earn chunk plays off double moves and zone coverage.  \n \nChism must continue working on route setups and breaks. He’s quick but he must leverage every bit of that quickness to his \nadvantage for him to develop into a reliable route runner at the NFL level.  \n \nChism is a capable pass catcher with only one isolated issue to clean up and that’s attack choice with one type of target \ntrajectory. After the catch, Chism is fun to watch. If he can prove quick and agile enough to translate his decision-making, \ncreativity, and agility to the NFL, Chism could make a roster and eventually develop into a starting slot receiver.  \n \nReleases: Chism has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands hang at either \nside of his front knee. He has releases where there’s no wasted motion as he rolls off his front foot.  \nWhen this happens, he can get more sink into his stance. When it Chism sinks deep enough to begin his release, he rocks \noff the back foot.  \nHe moves his arms at half their full range of motion off the line and he doesn’t run with his pads over his knees for more \nthan a third of the stem.  \nChism uses three-quick footwork with a wipe counter to steal a release on a slant on a running play. He uses a small two-\nquick to set up an out-breaking route at the top of his stem.  \nChism combines a two-quick and stick to attack a defender’s outside leverage before breaking inside.  \nThe moves are sudden but there’s no artistry with pacing.  \nChism uses a hesitation at the top of his stem to set up a shallow hitch. He uses a stick to set up a slant. He uses a read \nstep off the line to attack inside with his stem.  \nChism executes a feet-switch to set up a release to the inside. He uses a trigger step to set up tunnel screens.  \nSeparation: Chism will stack a man defender on a shallow crossing route. Without any release moves, Chism can earn \nseparation outside a man-to-man defensive back and stack the defender up the seam on a vertical route breaking beyond \n20 yards.  \n\n \n235 \nChism has strong short-area quickness but he’s not a long-speed threat. A safety lying on the ground 7 yards behind Chism \ncan regain his feet and chase 30-35 yards to bring the receiver down at the sideline. The safety has speed, but Chism has \nlinebackers gaining ground on him. He has just enough speed to flip the field on a well-design play that gets him into open \nfield.  \nRoute Stems: Chism will dive against inside shade coverage. He uses pacing to set up two-man route combinations in the \nred zone, slowing down as he widens his stem and then accelerating through his speed break to slant inside toward the \npost.  \nRoute Setups: When breaking over the middle, on a running play, Chism will show his head to the outside hash on the \nbackside of the run to sell the potential he’s blocking before breaking over the middle to chase and help on the front side. \nThis isn’t a route setup, but it shows potential for him to deliver peeks and insets.  \nRoute Breaks: Chism gets his head around fast and presents a friendly target on a shallow hitch. He has good weight drop \non whip routes. \nChism has a drop and pop break with weight drop out of a longer break step. The stem can be run at a higher speed into \nthe break. The break step should be longer and the weight drop deeper, but what Chism does has potential for \ndevelopment.  \nChism breaks back to the quarterback on out-breaking routes. His speed breaks lack a flat line step and he drifts out of \nbreaks but then works back to the ball. His drive step is flat.  \nOn shallow speed outs, he can deliver flat drive and line steps.  \nZone Routes: Chism identifies the second-level defender, works to depth and settles into the open area. He’ll work across \nthe zone on routes that require it and wait to show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Chism can track the ball over one shoulder and switch to the other, extend for the target, and make a \nsliding catch to get both feet inbounds near the boundary. Chism can make diving catches while dragging his feet at the \nboundary and his body is out of bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Chism tracks the ball over his shoulder on wide routes. He can track the ball to his inside shoulder and then \nswitch to his outside shoulder and find the ball to extend and catch. He also displays late hands after doing so. He can catch \nthe ball at the earliest point to set up transitions.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Chism attacks targets with overhand position that arrive at the numbers. He turns behind his break \npath on a vertical route and uses overhand attack to catch the ball while airborne and just after shedding contact from a \ndefender at his back hip.  \nChism can also turn behind his break path and catch the slant with underhand position at his back hip with coverage \nreaching for his chest and arm.  \nChism catches targets at the numbers with underhand position where it would be ideal to catch at the earliest window with \noverhand position.  \nChism can extend his arms away from his frame with underhand attack to earn targets. He extends to highpoint targets in \nstride high and away from his frame on post routes.  \nPosition: Chism can embrace the fall to avoid landing on the football. He also has a capable pull back when tracking over \nhis inside shoulder and the defender is on his inside hip. \nFocus: Chism can win the ball against tight coverage at his back hip. He can take contact to his chest and arm as he \ncatches targets on the move. He can take a hit to his back and the arm securing the ball as he catches a shallow out.  \nTransitions: Chism catches and pierces downhill when he makes a reception facing the quarterback. He can abandon \ncatch-and-pierce principles by stopping after an initial turn downhill to reverse field across the face of the opponent. This \nlimited his production after the catch.  \n\n \n236 \nElusiveness: Chism pairs a stiff arm with a spin to work outside contact. He can dip and use curvilinear bend to navigate \naround pursuit at a nice rate of speed. He only needs two small steps at full speed to bend at 45-degree angles around \nblocks or unblocked pursuit. Chism gets his knees high to work over low shots to his feet.  \nChism jump cuts away from pursuit and can displace his stance with his feet so he’s giving and taking away a leg to slip \nwrap attempts. He also makes sharp lateral cuts away from downhill pursuit while running at full speed. He can get his feet \nand knees high through the cut.  \nHis hips are mobile enough to flip them for quick turns downhill. This is much like the ability to transition downhill with 1-2 \nsmall steps. He also reduces his shoulders from contact effectively.  \nHe uses his stiff arm to set up spins away from reaches.  \nVision: Chism is a patient open-field his presses blocks tight upon approach to get the defender into the blocker before \nbouncing or cutting back. He’ll press multiple times with the same downfield block to turn pursuit around and ultimately \nwork past it without any stop-start moves.  \nChism understands how to manage down-and-distance as a runner on design plays like screens and RPOs. He dives for the \nmarker and makes efficient moves to get downhill. He limits his risks.  \nPower: Chism uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his torso and force a defender to slide down to the receiver’s legs, if \nhe doesn’t forces them to the ground without making contact to his legs at all. The stiff-arm is versatile enough to use it as \na Marshawn Lynch “get off me” side-swat/throw-by to work with the defender’s momentum and send the opponent flying.  \nChism keeps his feet moving when stiff-arming defenders or getting wrapped from behind. He pulls through reaches to his \nframe. He can pull through multiple reaches and when he has downfield momentum, push a pile 3-5 yards through \ndefensive backs. He sells out when he’s near the goal line or the sticks – diving, hurdling, and taking on defenders.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He stalemates cornerback collisions in the open field.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Chism has a capable balance-touch to regain balance as a runner.  \nBall Security: Chism carries the ball high to his frame and can take contact to the ball-carrying arm. He uses his boundary-\nside arm to carry the ball. He switches the ball away from pursuit when running in the open field.  \nBlocking: When stalk blocking, Chism can be too aggressive with his approach to an off-coverage defender and overrun his \nangle. He should stop halfway to the defender and force the defender to declare a path and then adjust to it. \nIf Chism reaches the defender without tipping off the opponent, his aggressive approach yields a strong push and a \ndominating effort. This isn’t the norm. Because he overruns, he has difficulty earning a square and balanced position with \nweight drop before the defender initiates contact. This allows the defender to generate a push.  \nWhen Chism earns square position to the defender, he works his hands inside to the chest play without striking. He must \ncontinue moving his feet to turn the defender away from the ball carrier. His prone to not moving his feet and the defender \ncan shed and earn position to the ball carrier.  \nChism will run off a defender and tilt into him to seal the inside for a screen or check-down outside. At the very least, Chism \nwill continue moving the defender with a one-arm technique.  \nWhen Chism can get his hands into the chest of the defender, he can move his feet and turn the defender away from the \npath to the ball carrier.  \nChism can use a release from the slot to set up a defender, getting the defender’s back to the runner on a developing play. \nHe will also earn a square and squat stance but he must be more aggressive with his footwork to drive and turn the \ndefender as soon as he earns this position. He can wait a little too long and lose the advantage.  \nWhen he slants inside and earns the outside shoulder of a linebacker, he can generate a push from the backside to force \ndefender out of the play.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \n\n \n237 \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Chism from afar. Worth a speculative addition for expanded preseason fantasy \nrosters if you hear about his routes, hands, and YAC skills leading up to training camp.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFlat Drive/Line Steps, Switches Tracking Shoulders, Late Hands, Boundary Work \n• \nCreative and Determined Runner with Good Stiff Arm \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n238",
        "analysis": "Efton Chism III is a slot receiver prospect with impressive after-the-catch ability and strong short-area quickness.  His game is compared to a blend of Amon-Ra St. Brown, Sterling Shepard, and James Proche.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **After the Catch (YAC):** Chism excels at making defenders miss, demonstrating impressive elusiveness, vision, power (stiff arm), and balance. He utilizes a variety of moves (jumps cuts, spins, stiff arms) to create extra yardage and consistently fights for extra yards.\n* **Short-Area Quickness:** He possesses excellent agility and change-of-direction skills, allowing him to create separation against man coverage, particularly on short to intermediate routes.\n* **Hands and Catch Radius:** He shows reliable hands and the ability to extend to make catches in tight coverage, even while taking contact.\n* **Route Running (Potential):** While needing refinement, his route running shows flashes of potential. He is capable of executing various release techniques and has a good understanding of zone concepts.  His breaks need improvement to become consistently sharp and precise at the NFL level.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:**  This is his biggest area for improvement.  He needs to become more consistent and precise in his route breaks, leveraging his quickness more effectively to create separation.  Improving pacing and artistry in his route running will be crucial.\n* **Long Speed:** While his short-area quickness is a plus, his lack of top-end speed limits his potential as a deep threat.\n* **Target Choice:** He needs to improve his decision-making regarding which trajectory to attack the ball from, focusing more on optimal catching positions.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report highlights the comparisons:\n\n* **Amon-Ra St. Brown:**  Shares the slot receiver role and after-the-catch ability, but St. Brown is a more polished route runner with better overall athleticism.\n* **Sterling Shepard:** Similar in size and playing style, focusing on quickness and route running in the slot, although Shepard possessed more long speed early in his career.\n* **James Proche:** A similar type of receiver with reliable hands and route-running capabilities, albeit less dynamic after the catch.\n* **Cooper Kupp (distant comparison):**  Both are Eastern Washington alumni with similar styles emphasizing quickness and hands, but Kupp's athleticism and route running were far superior at the same stage of their respective careers.  This is more of a stylistic comparison than a skill-level one.\n\n\n**Overall:**  Chism projects as a potential slot receiver with a high floor due to his YAC ability and reliable hands. His development hinges on improving his route running consistency and precision. He is a player worth monitoring during the pre-draft process and training camp.\n"

        "player_name": "Dominic Lovett",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR45 \nJersey No. 6 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/185 School: Georgia/Missouri \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Randall Cobb - - Jalen Nailor/Robert Lewis/X – - Shi Smith \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 77.2 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nKentucky ‘24 \n• \nAlabama ‘24 \n• \nAuburn ‘24 \n• \nTexas (I) ‘24 \n• \nFlorida ‘24 \n• \nTennessee ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Lovett is a short-area receiver with the athletic ability and burgeoning technical skills as a route \nrunner to become much more. Lovett must expand his route game to include more breaks with optimal technique and \nimprove his plan of attack as a boundary receiver against man-to-man coverage.  \n \nLovett’s greatest potential obstacle to playing time is his hands. When forced to extend his arms away from his frame, he’s \nprone to clap-attacking targets. Lovett also lacks skill with earning advantageous position against defenders in contested \nscenarios.  \n \nLovett must also become wiser as a decision-maker with the ball in his hands. Too often, he tries one move too many and \nmisses opportunities to move the chains for his offense.  \n \nThere are players ranked below Lovett with higher ceilings—and more attainable ones. Still, Lovett could find a role with an \nNFL team and have enough indirect impact that he builds a career.  \n \nReleases: Lovett has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands rest uncrossed at \nhis front knee.  \nLovett has a small rock off his back foot before releasing from the line of scrimmage. He doesn’t sink into his stance. Even \nwhen Lovett doesn’t rock off the back foot, there’s minimal, if any, sink into his stance.  \nLovett comes off the line with his pads over his knees  \nLovett uses a two-quick with a blade release counter – a shoulder reduction and shed combo – or a swat-swim combo. He \nalso uses a hip shift with a swat-swim counter against off coverage.  \nLovett also uses the two-quick or a double up to steal a release.  \nLovett’s shed counters are violent and effective.  \nLovett releases inside of tight coverage with a violent stick. He’ll follow up at the top of the stem with a lean-in before \nbreaking inside.  \nLovett has an effective stick and wipe combination. His double up lacks artistry and is too compact to generate \nmanipulation. When he combines it with a hesitation, it’s effective and there’s patience and suddenness.  \nThere is some artistry between patience and suddenness with his read step.  \nHe must develop a plan with routes working up the boundary because he gets knocked off his line and pinned to the \nboundary too often.  \nSeparation: He doesn’t earn significant separation against tight man coverage the line with vertical stems. Middle \nlinebackers can run him down at the boundary after beginning their pursuit in the middle of the field. Lovett can gain 25-30 \nyards.  \n\n \n239 \nRoute Stems: Lovett stems routes inside (diving) against inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Lovett employs a hip shift and spin at the top of his stem as his break on a whip route. He has a capable \ninset paired with a dive of the stem to set up a break to the outside.  \nLovett uses a timely head nod to the boundary to sell the peek against outside shade coverage at the top of his stem. \nLovett can stair step with a dive, a vertical, and then a break inside.  \nRoute Breaks: When running a shallow out, Lovett has a flat drive step and flat line step. He can drop his weight into a \nwhip route.  \nZone Routes: Lovett identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open field while creating a \nfriendly target. When Lovett doesn’t earn a target in these circumstance, he will work to an open spot for his quarterback.   \nLovett tempos his breaks on vertical routes and doesn’t show his eyes until he passes the rollover/buzz defender. Once he \nshows his eyes to the quarterback, he must keep his eyes on the quarterback. He has lost track of where the ball is going \nbecause he turned his head away momentarily after showing his eyes.  \nRoute Boundary: Lovett displays boundary awareness. He can toe-tap as well as drag the shin and knee.  \nPass Tracking: Lovett has late hands on back-shoulder plays. He has shown difficulty determining when to high-point on a \nfade and when to retreat and extend for the ball with his feet on the ground.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lovett catches targets at waist level with underhand position. He attacks the ball at the earliest \npoint when facing the target arriving at his numbers. He uses overhand position.  \nLovett extends below his knees and digs out low targets. He has clap-dropped the targets when he turns his head downfield \nbefore securing the ball into his hands and frame.  \nLovett also has lapses where he clap-attacks high-point opportunities and allows the ball to squirt through his hands. Lovett \nalso clap-attacks targets away from his frame when using underhand attack when he should have used an overhand attack.  \nHe doesn’t use the ideal hand position for the height of the target when it’s at the numbers. Lovett also has focus drops.  \nPosition: Lovett embraces the fall when digging out low targets. If he’s going to earn back-shoulder targets against tight \ncoverage, Lovett must prevent defenders from getting tight to his frame. He must establish distance between his arms and \nhis body so he can reinforce that position at the top of the route before he reaches for the ball. Otherwise, he’s pushing off \nand getting called for offensive pass interference.  \nFocus: He can take contact to his back as he makes the catch, including catches high and behind his break path. He can \nhigh-point and take contact to this back.  \nTransitions: Lovett will catch and pierce downhill. He also obeys the direction of the ball to determine where he runs.  \nElusiveness: Lovett flips his hips effectively to change direction efficiently. He has a smooth spin away from pursuit. He \nhas a good stick. He alters stride length effectively. He reduces his shoulder from reaches high to his frame. He gets his feet \nhigh to avoid low shots. He can transition downhill with two steps.  \nVision: When Lovett has an option to split defenders and get downhill or continue east-west and take on a cornerback, he’ll \nsacrifice the yardage and remain east-west. He must adopt a better downhill mentality in the open field without blockers to \nhelp him.  \nLovett tries too hard to make a move to avoid one defender who has a favorable pursuit angle than work downhill into \nmultiple defenders – even if the odds of him gaining more yardage is higher working toward the traffic. He encounters \nunexpected shots and avoids them effectively.  \nLovett sets up sticks in the open field with a press of the defender over the top in one direction before delivering the stick.  \nPower: Lovett delivers a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame and forces defenders to wrap up. He also pulls through \nreaches to his upper body.  \n\n \n240 \nHe drops his pads but his feet go dead after contact because he turns his upper body 90 degrees to his hips and legs and \nthat costs him balance and position after contact.  \nWhen he’s wrapped from the side by a linebacker, Lovett keeps his feet moving and he can carry the linebacker 3-5 yards \ndownfield without a lot of momentum generated beforehand.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He’ll stalemate a or run over a cornerback when he has momentum into the contact.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots from safeties.  \nBall Security: Lovett carries the ball under his boundary-side arm. The ball swings under his arm when running in the open \nfield. He pulls through reaches and contact to his ball-carrying arm.  \nLovett has lapses where he carries the ball under his left arm even when working up the right boundary.  \nBlocking: Lovett earns a square and squat position and shuffles his feet to move laterally. He’s patient with closing the gap \nbetween himself and his Man Over Me assignment. Still, he can close the gap tighter.  \nHe delivers his hands with an uppercut motion but not really as a punch and not having small enough gap between himself \nand the defender doesn’t encourage a punch. The elbows are bent.  \nAgainst the force player, Lovett can earn a tight position to the defensive end and deliver a strike with tight hands.  \nDurability: Lower leg injuries in 2022 that limited at Missouri.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Lovett from afar. Lovett is a high-floor prospect with a ceiling doesn’t look high \nenough to provide consistent fantasy value. He’s a better indirect value to NFL teams than direct value to fantasy GMs. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n241",
        "analysis": "Dominic Lovett is a slot receiver prospect with a high floor but a relatively low ceiling according to this scouting report.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:** Possesses burgeoning technical skills and shows potential to become a more refined route runner.  He utilizes diverse release techniques (two-quick, blade release, hip shift), effective stick and wipe combos, and shows artistry in his read steps. He demonstrates boundary awareness and can execute toe-taps and drags. He displays a good understanding of zone concepts, finding open areas for the quarterback.  \n* **Agility and Elusiveness:** Exhibits smooth transitions, efficient hip flips for direction changes, and effective use of the stiff arm and stick moves to avoid tackles.  He can alter stride length and avoid low shots effectively.\n* **Blocking:** Shows promise as a blocker, demonstrating a willingness to engage and earn good position, although he could improve his hand placement and punching technique.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improving Hand Usage:** His biggest weakness is catching the ball. He is prone to “clap-attacking” targets, leading to drops. Improving his hand placement and consistency in securing the ball, particularly on high points and targets away from his frame, is crucial.\n* **Decision-Making:** He tends to try overly complex moves after the catch, often sacrificing potential yardage. Improving his decision-making and adopting a more downhill mentality would significantly enhance his effectiveness.\n* **Route Tree Expansion:** While he has a foundation of route running skills, expanding his route tree, particularly working against man coverage on the boundary, will be key to increasing his NFL viability.\n* **Contested Catches:**  He struggles in contested situations and needs to improve his ability to win 50/50 balls.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Hands:** Inconsistent and prone to drops.\n* **Contested Catches:** Struggles to win against tight man coverage.\n* **Decision-making (with the ball):** Tries too many moves after the catch, leading to missed opportunities.\n* **Boundary receiver play:** Gets knocked off his line and pinned to the boundary too often.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report compares him to Randall Cobb, Jalen Nailor, Robert Lewis, and Shi Smith.  This suggests a player who is more of a slot receiver who relies on quickness and route-running rather than size and physicality.  The comparison spectrum indicates a range of outcomes, from a productive slot receiver (Cobb) to a player with more limited impact (Smith).\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nLovett projects as a potential contributor in the NFL, but his ceiling is limited by his inconsistent hands and decision-making.  His success will depend on significantly improving his ball security and developing a more consistent approach to both catching and running after the catch. He's a high-floor, low-ceiling prospect who likely will make a roster but not be a star.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR46 \nJersey No. 11 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/160 School: Texas / Oregon State  \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: JJ Nelson - Tutu Atwell – X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 77.1 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nArizona State ‘22 \n• \nFlorida ‘22 \n• \nUtah ‘23 \n• \nUCLA ‘23 \n• \nOregon ‘23 \n• \nGeorgia I ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: J.J. Nelson and Tutu Atwell are the archetype of receiver that has occasional statistical value in any \ngiven week. They have more indirect impact on the offense because of their speed to stretch coverage out of shape and \ncreate opportunities for teammates.  \n \nBolden fits that archetype. He’s a gadget-option and special teams speedster that an offensive coach uses on slow-\ndeveloping deep routes that work across the field with play-action and misdirection manipulating defenses so Bolden earns \nthe ball in wide-open space. When this happens, Bolden can do the rest with his return skills.  \n \nGive Bolden screens, RPOs, and the routes described above and he has the hands to do the job. Ask Bolden to run timing \nroutes against tight man coverage and earn targets in contested situations with aerial flair, and that’s a potential \ndealbreaker.  \n \nBolden’s indirect value to NFL offenses will probably be much greater than the direct value to fantasy offenses.  \n \nReleases: Bolden has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side \nof his front leg. \nWhen Bolden sinks into his stance to begin his release, he rocks off his back leg and hops out of his stance to move forward. \nInstead of rolling off his front foot, his front foot and back foot come off the ground.  \nBolden uses a double up with his outside foot to attack outside leverage before breaking inside. He uses a read step and a \nstick in succession to attack outside leverage, but the lack of counter get him forced to the ground.  \nBolden has a stick to the outside and counters with a wipe. He uses a read step to steal a release. He uses a two-quick at \nthe top of his stem to set up a release.  \nBolden has a feet-switch to set up an outside release.  \nBolden has a patient hesitation paired with a sudden double up to set up a slant. He’ll reduce his shoulder from the \ndefender.  \nSeparation: Bolden is quicker than fast, and he doesn’t pull away from defensive backs after earning early separation \ndownhill with a route. Defenders recover their position quickly if they aren’t beaten initially by 3-4 steps or on a double \nmove.  \nBolden has a strong double move on the out-and-up that can get him 5-6 steps of separation, if not more.  \nRoute Stems: Bolden will dive or widen stems. He uses the widen to set up the defender with a stem downhill after \nshedding the defender’s reach. He’ll also run at the defender.  \n\n \n242 \nRoute Setups: Bolden will take the back of a defender late in the stem. On a seam route, Bolden can sell a stick to the \ninside with a slight head nod with it and then a few steps later, sell a stick to the outside with a nod to the boundary. If he \nused more detail with the head fakes and added some turns of the body in those directions, he’d have an inset and a peek.  \nBolden can peek to the boundary as part of an out-and-up. He delivers a contrast of patience and suddenness as he peeks \nand then accelerates downhill. He also can deliver an inset mid-stem.  \nRoute Breaks: Bolden drifts with speed breaks because his drive and line steps aren’t flat enough, but Bolden has reps \nwhere he delivers flat drive and line steps. He earns a friendly target out of breaks on hitches.  \nHe can drop his weight at the top of stems into a drop and pop break. He can also use a long break step into the drop and \npop.  \nZone Routes: Bolden identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area, creating a \nfriendly target.  \nRoute Boundary: Bolden is aware of the boundary as a ball carrier. He’ll dive for the first down marker when forced out of \nbounds.  \nBolden can fully extend one arm over his head and then behind his frame to make a one-handed catch where he \nsomersaults backward after the catch, doing this against tight coverage. The problem is that he tracked this target over his \ninside shoulder. If he tracked it over his outside shoulder, there’s a much greater chance that he didn’t need to go airborne \nand he could have shielded the defender from the ball while having more control of his body near the boundary.  \nBolden is aware of the boundary as a receiver. On speed outs, Bolden can get one foot inbounds or both feet with a tap and \ndrag.  \nPass Tracking: Bolden leaves his feet to catch targets with underhand attack at the numbers. He tracks targets over his \nshoulder with underhand attack.  \nBolden can catch the ball away from his frame and also while tracking over his shoulder. He can leap with full extension for \nthe target.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Bolden catches targets at his numbers with underhand position when it’s optimal that he use \noverhand position. He uses overhand position with the target is above his shoulders.  \nWhen he has errors with technique, he’s clap-attacking with overhand technique.  \nBolden can dig out low throws below his knees.  \nPosition: Bolden can embrace the fall after a full-extension catch over the shoulder.  \nFocus: Bolden can take a wrap to his back after catching a crosser where he settled into the open zone. He can also take a \nhard shot to the chest over the middle on a slant. He can high-point and take a hit to his back.  \nTransitions: Bolden can turn through his catch to orient himself downhill as he makes the reception.  \nElusiveness: Bolden can make sharp lateral cuts across the face of pursuit. He alters his stride length effectively. He only \nneeds two quick steps to transition from a downhill path to an east-west path against pursuit over the top and vice versa. \nBolden has curvilinear bend on perimeter runs and excellent hip mobility to flip his hips and accelerate away from pursuit. \nBolden can implement a tight spin off a lateral cut or a hit.  \nVision: Bolden finds opportunities to reverse field after identifying penetration into the backfield. He’s decisive about hitting \nthese backside creases. He’s a patient and creative runner who can press unblocked defenders and create creases. He will \ntake risks that can lead to successful gains.  \nPower: Bolden has a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He pulls through reaches to his lower leg. He keeps his feet \nmoving with the defender on his back. Bolden can balance-touch after pulling through contact.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a glancing shot to one side of his chest from a safety.  \n\n \n243 \nBall Security: Bolden carries the ball close to his chest and under his boundary-side arm or the arm that’s furthest from \nthe nearest pursuit. He’ll switch the arm he uses mid-run when necessary. The elbow is loose from his side.  \nBlocking: Bolden squares Man Over Me assignments with a squat position. He sets up about two yards from the defender, \nwaiting for the defender to close some of the gap before adjusting his position when blocking inside the numbers. He moves \nwell laterally.  \nWhen blocking outside the numbers, Bolden works too close to the Man Over Me assignment and tips off his position. This \nallows the defender to run past Bolden to the ball carrier.  \nWhen Bolden closes the gap in a timely manner, he can roll through the hips when he makes contact with his hands. Even \nso, Bolden doesn’t cultivate a punch as a blocker. Too often, Bolden throws a shoulder or his back at the defender. This is \nrarely productive, and he often misses the assignment because he’s throwing his body in an out-of-control fashion rather \nthan squaring a delivering a strike with his hands.  \nWhether it’s Man Over Me or Most Dangerous Man, Bolden must do more to close the gap against defenders before he \ndelivers his hands, this leads to Bolden fully extending his arms and locking out. His arms tend to be wide and his “strikes” \nare more like “hugs.”  \nBolden can shuffle his feet in squat stance to move laterally and keep his stance wide.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar unless your league awards points in the return game.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFull-extension catch over the shoulder and embraces the fall \n• \nAcrobatic grab, but out of bounds and better tracking needed \n• \nPost and ping-ponged between DBs \n• \nTwo-step transitions downhill and across the field  \n• \nOregon State Highlights \n• \nTexas Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n244",

His ability to make defenders miss makes him a threat even on short passes.\n* **Return Skills:** His speed translates to high value in kick and punt returns.\n* **Improvisational Ability:**  He demonstrates creativity as a runner, finding ways to extend plays and create yardage.\n* **Ball Security:** He shows a knack for protecting the football.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Return Game Specialist:**  This is his most likely path to early playing time and NFL longevity.\n* **Offensive Role Expansion:** With improved route running and better ball tracking, he could potentially carve out a niche as a specialized receiver.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Needs significant improvement in running precise routes against tight coverage. His route breaks are inconsistent.  He struggles with timing routes and contested catches.\n* **Catch Technique:** While he can make spectacular catches, his technique needs refinement. He often uses underhand catches when an overhand technique would be more efficient and reliable.\n* **Blocking:** While he shows effort in blocking, his technique is poor and he often fails to make effective contact.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report directly compares him to JJ Nelson and Tutu Atwell.  Both are speedy slot receivers who have had limited NFL success, mostly due to inconsistencies in their receiving skills.  This accurately reflects Bolden's potential and limitations.  He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect whose value hinges heavily on his special teams contributions and improvement in receiving technique.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR47 \nJersey: No.6 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/200 School: Florida/Arizona State \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: CeeDee Lamb – Puka Nacua/Golden Tate – X/Early Doucet \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 76.4 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nColorado ’23  \n• \nOregon ‘23 \n• \nTAMU ‘24 \n• \nUCF ‘24 \n• \nLSU ‘24 \n• \nMississippi ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Badger is a great example of the glut of players I described in the beginning of this chapter. They \nhave a toolbox filled with tools, but they currently lack the high-level craftsmanship to get the most out of them. \n \nBadger’s releases, stems, setups, and breaks have the potential to become pro-caliber. They lack the timing, pacing, and \nflair required to bait NFL defensive backs.  \n \nBadger has most of the fundamentals mastered as a pass catcher. The next level for Badger is to learn how to perform \njump up and through positioning so he can become an asset at the boundary on back-shoulder plays. He also needs to \nclean up a tendency to use underhand position in scenarios that minimize his positional advantage to the ball.  \n \nAfter the catch, Badger is an effective runner with a good blend of speed, agility, quickness, power, and vision. Badger’s \nbest immediate match is in the short and intermediate passing game with routes that break across the field and outlet \npasses that get him into space. He could contribute immediately in this capacity.  \n \nMost likely, Badger will be asked to do a lot more in an offense and that’s where he’ll need more time to develop his game. \nAs a prospect, he has a solid enough floor to make a roster. If he can unlock his ceiling, he could become a contributor who \ncan start and produce for weeks at a time when called upon. \n \nReleases: Badger has a staggered stance with 80/200 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest at either \nside of his front knee. He has shown with slow releases that he can roll off the front foot without wasted motion, but with \nreleases that have urgency, he rocks off the back foot.  \nWhen running a diamond release, Badger must develop a greater contrast between patience and suddenness so he can sell \nthe stem artfully.  \nBadger reduces the shoulder when releasing outside a defender playing a shallow cushion from the line of scrimmage. He \nuses a read-step and a wipe counter to work inside. Neither move has enough violence to be compelling and effective.  \nBadger has a two-quick with a shed counter, but neither move has violence or artfulness of pacing. Badger has a footswitch \nto set up an outside release.  \nBadger has a swat but he uses arm counters without setting them up with his feet. He has been effective with a swat-swim \ncombination against off-coverage. His read-step and swim counter is effective against tight man.  \nHe reduces the shoulder from a defender’s hands. Badger has learned to use a read-step and double-up combo, but there is \nno craft with the execution and this limits any upside for separation.  \nHe also has a good read step and swat counter. He also has a good read step and blade counter (shoulder reduction and \nshed combo). Badger has a double up combination with a second double up with each foot that is the equivalent of a person \nmumbling rather than articulating what they want to say. He must display more craft with the movement.  \n\n \n245 \nSeparation: Badger has the speed out outrun a cornerback in man-to-man on a crossing route. He can cross the middle of \nthe field and turn up the opposite boundary and win the matchup. He can beat the safety who is inside and over the top and \nthreaten the other cornerback on the same side of the field.  \nBadger will stack a defender within the first 10 yards of a vertical stem. He’s consistent with stacking.  \nRoute Stems: Badger will widen a stem against shallow off-coverage and then wipe past the defender as he flattens out \nthe stem into a vertical stem. He’ll use a head fake to set up the stem that he widens.  \nBadger will run at a defender to set up a speed break.  \nRoute Setups: Badger will give a peek to the boundary to sell the fade, but there’s no craft with pacing or stems to set it \nup. He’ll chase the defender’s near hip and then take the back of the defender.  \nBadger has potential to deliver a good stair-step, but must attack the vertical element of the stem with greater urgency. He \ndoes this better when off-coverage has a deep cushion over him.  \nBadger uses his eyes well to set up his stem inside against off coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Badger has a three-step break with a long break step on the comeback. He finishes friendly and works back \nto the ball. There’s enough weight drop for him to earn separation against tight man coverage at the top of an intermediate \nstem when he runs the route.  \nHis speed breaks have flat drive and line steps, but I haven’t see him run them at full speed.  \nZone Routes: Badger doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. When in an \nopen zone and his quarterback is buying time, Badger maintains a friendly target to the quarterback and slides into the \nopen area.  \nRoute Boundary: Badger is aware of the boundary and drags his feet from a static position as he reaches for the ball. He \ncan also tap both feet inbounds while breaking toward the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: He tracks short targets—wide routes—over his shoulder. He displays late hands against tight coverage on \nback-shoulder targets.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Badger catches targets at his beltline with underhand position. He can use tight overhand attack \nnear the numbers and his helmet. He’ll also extend behind his frame with underhand position. He can tip targets to himself.  \nHe’ll dig out low throws with extended arms below his knees—squatting or getting on his knees to make the catch.  \nHe has lapses where he attacks targets at the numbers with underhand position in the path of a defender who has a better \nchance of swatting the ball away because of Badger’s attack choice. This happens too often against tight coverage.  \nPosition: Badger must recognize situations on vertical route where he should jump up and through to attack the ball rather \nthan track over his shoulder.  \nFocus: Badger can take a hit to his back as he catches a target near his helmet or numbers. He can catch targets at his \nwaist with underhand attack with a defender wrapped around his back and waist on crossing routes.  \nTransitions: Badger practices catch and pierce principles.  \nElusiveness: Badger doesn’t need a transition step to work from east-west to north-south after catching a crossing route \nto the short side of the field. Badger only needs a step when working to the long side of the field. He flips his hips at 90 \ndegrees at a good pace. He also steps over low shots without breaking stride.  \nBadger spins through wraps to his waist and glancing shots to his torso. He flips his hips effectively to turn away from \npursuit.  \nVision: When Badger sees he has no blockers and he’s in the black zone, he’ll take what he can get in a straight line, \ndropping his pads and splitting defenders. When the situation is right, Badger is patient and will seek cutbacks and reversals \nof field. He presses into rushing lanes and sets up blocks well while also buying time for it to happen when initially facing \ndefenders who are unblocked.  \n\n \n246 \nPower: Badger uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He pulls through wraps to his waist from cornerbacks. He \ndrops his pads and keeps his feet moving. He can drag a defensive end wrapped around his waist for a few yards.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Badger wins collisions with safeties when he has momentum. He may not run through the \ndefender, but he’ll knock the defender backward and fall forward for additional yardage.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Badger bounces off hard glancing shots from cornerbacks and linebackers in the open field.  \nBall Security: Badger carries the ball away under his left arm—even when there’s no reason to do so when on the right \nside of the field. I’ve seen one play in six games where Badger used the right arm when outside the right hash as a ball \ncarrier. The security is high to his chest, but wide from his frame. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlocking: Although he’s prone to overextending, Badger can seal the edge on a linebacker with good position to the outside  \nshoulder on a perimeter play. He has the strength, anchor, and feet to sustain contact with the defender and turn him \ninside. He’ll work across the field to earn position on a safety when executing Most Dangerous Man assignments.  \nHe doesn’t get close enough on Man Over Me Assignments and his arms can be too straight when engaged.  \nBadger will run off a defender and tilt into the man, using the defender’s position to Badger’s advantage.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Badger from afar, but be prepared to act if Badger is earning a role in the offense \nbecause of his hands and his skill after the catch. He’ll a speculative addition for expanded offseason rosters.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nZone Triangle Knowledge, Transition, Stiff Arm, Step Over \n• \nOpen-Field Creativity and Patience \n• \nMust Become Artful vs. Man Coverage \n• \nRelease Footwork Lacking Craft \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n247",
        "analysis": "Elijhah Badger is a WR prospect with a high ceiling but needs refinement to reach it.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **After the Catch:**  Excellent runner with a blend of speed, agility, quickness, power, and vision.  Effective in short and intermediate routes, immediately contributing in this capacity.\n* **Hands/Catch Radius:** Reliable hands, capable of making catches at his beltline, helmet, and even low throws. Can extend his frame to make difficult grabs.  Able to take hits while securing the catch.\n* **Physicality:**  Good stiff arm and ability to break tackles.  Can drag defenders for extra yardage.  Shows decent blocking potential, able to seal the edge.\n* **Route Running Fundamentals:** Possesses many of the fundamental route-running techniques, including stacking defenders and breaking routes.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** Needs to improve timing, pacing, and artistry in his releases, stems, and breaks to consistently beat NFL-level cornerbacks.  Currently lacks violence and craft in his movements.  Needs to improve his jump-and-through technique on back-shoulder throws and eliminate underhand catches in crucial situations.\n* **Consistency:**  Inconsistent in his route running and ball-catching technique.   Needs to improve his consistency in high-pressure situations.\n* **Ball Security:** While his ball security is generally good,  he inconsistently carries the ball in the optimal arm.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report provides a wide range of comparisons, reflecting his diverse skillset and areas needing improvement.  The comparisons highlight potential outcomes based on his development:\n\n* **High-End Potential (CeeDee Lamb):**  Suggests his ceiling, if he refines his technique and timing.\n* **Realistic Potential (Puka Nacua/Golden Tate):** More likely scenarios, given his current skill level.  These players are solid role players with strengths in specific areas.\n* **Lower-End Potential (Early Doucet):**  A possible outcome if he fails to significantly improve his route running.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBadger is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His athleticism and after-the-catch ability are enticing, but his inconsistent route running and occasional technical flaws could limit his impact at the NFL level.  His success will depend on his ability to refine his technique and consistently execute at a higher level.  He's likely a late-round pick or undrafted free agent, with a chance to make a roster if he can develop as anticipated.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR48 \nJersey: No.3 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/213 School: Memphis \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: David Boston - - Gabriel Davis/X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 76.3 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nFSU ‘24 \n• \nMTSU ‘24 \n• \nUSF ‘24 \n• \nCharlotte ‘24 \n• \nUTSA ’24  \n• \nRice ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Taylor is like the car you see in the showroom or dealer lot that has the tricked-out interior and a \nbeautiful exterior. It gets buyers excited, but they’re the type of buyers who generally have little knowledge of how a \nquality car is built and these suckers are willing to pay upwards of 18 percent interest on the loan to get it.  \n \nWhat’s that little box?  \n \nWhere?  \n \nThe one near the ignition?  \n \nThat locks down the car if you’re behind on your payments. Makes it easier for us to come and get it… \n \nTaylor’s game has enough speed to defeat various forms of man coverage. He wins contested targets and has some power \nafter the catch.  \n \nHowever, when you know what to look for under the hood, Taylor is the basic performance package hidden underneath a \nhigh-performance exterior. The good news is that a skilled motorhead can upgrade the vehicle with time and effort and give \nthe customer what they thought they were buying. \n \nTaylor’s has the physical skills to become an adept route runner against man and zone and his lapses with catching the ball \nare correctable. If he does so, Taylor could accelerate his game and become a high-performance flanker who can win along \nthe boundary and over the middle.  \n \nUnfortunately, Taylor will either have to become his own mechanic or find the right motorhead to help him – and that’s \neasier said than done. The clap-attacking may never go way, but that may be something you can live with. \n \nReleases: Taylor uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang straight at \neither side of his front knee. \nTaylor sinks into his stance before rolling off his front foot. However, he also extends his back foot with an extra step and \nrocks off it before moving forward.  \nTaylor can sink into his stance without wasted motion and roll off the front foot.  \nTaylor’s pads are over his knees as he exits the line and his head is up. He pumps his arms fully through the release and \ninto his stem.  \nTaylor uses a small hesitation near the top of his stem to set up a dip outside the off-coverage. He also uses a stick and \nwipe counter.  \nTaylor has a two-quick against press coverage to release outside. He has a violent shed when the defender shoots his \nhands.  \n\n \n248 \nTaylor uses a hip shift when the defender is playing off-coverage and has turned his hips to run downfield but still has his \nhead turned to monitor Taylor. \nWhen breaking back to the quarterback against tight coverage, Taylor delivers a swim.  \nWhen running a route on a pass play, Taylor will use a two-quick against press and counter with a swat-swim. Taylor’s \nswat-swim might be his best counter, especially at the top of stems breaking back to the quarterback and deep vertical \nbreaks to get inside or outside the defender at the top of the stem.  \nTaylor uses a double up to set up outside-shade coverage for a release inside. He’ll use a read-step to steal a release. He’ll \nalso combine the double up and read step as footwork for stealing a release.  \nAnother footwork pattern to steal a release is a duck-walk/stutter. Taylor has a sudden foot-switch to set up an inside \nrelease.  \nHe can deliver a shed to counter a read step to get inside a defender and then stack.  \nTaylor’s releases lack artistry when it comes to pacing variations. The closest thing to patience and suddenness with a \nfootwork release from Taylor is his read step to the outside to set up an inside release and when he pairs it with a \nhesitation.  \nSeparation: Taylor will stack a defender within the first 15-20 yards of the line.  \nRoute Stems: Taylor attacks the outside leverage of the defensive back off the line by widening his stem. He’ll also use a \nstick inside and counter with a wipe as he works outside.  \nTaylor runs at a defender – widening his stem – to set up a teammates route outside that zone defender.  \nHe dives inside to set up inside shade on longer routes.  \nRoute Setups: Taylor delivers an inset at the top of stems on vertical breaks. Good dip and turn of the head with the stick.  \nRoute Breaks: Taylor gets his head around fast when breaking inside on the slant.  \nTaylor has a long break step. He must work on dropping his weight for a drop and pop break. When executing a speed \nbreak, he has a flat drive step and a flat line step. His speed turns breaking inside can drift. He has reps where  he slips \nwhile executing drive steps on both in- and out-breaking routes.  \nOther than when he runs slants against off-coverage, his breaks need snap.  \nTaylor uses the long break step with his three-step break and he works back to the quarterback out of the break. There is \nweight drop with the three-step break, but it can be more sudden and deeper.  \nHe works the scramble drill when the first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nZone Routes: Taylor identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Taylor can tap one foot in bounds after leaving his feet. He doesn’t display awareness of the boundary \nand consistently only gets one foot inbounds because he doesn’t appear aware of the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: He can track the ball over his shoulder. He leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets and can lose position to \nget both feet inbounds.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Taylor must attack targets at their earliest point with tight coverage at his back and must do so \nwith tighter hands so he’s not clap-attacking. He can allow the ball to be knocked away because he didn’t use his length \nadvantage. He clap-attacks high low in this fashion.   \nHe can attack the ball with overhand position over his shoulder with a slight clap. Taylor catches the ball behind his frame.  \nPosition: He can jump-up-and-through to earn position for a high-point. He can execute a pullback and embrace the fall.  \n\n \n249 \nFocus: He can take contact to his back or chest while catching a target on a crossing route or fade route up the boundary. \nHe makes plays against tight coverage and contact while facing the ball or with his back to the ball in the middle of the field \nor the boundary. He must address the attack issues with clapping.  \nTransitions: Taylor can catch and pierce and obey the ball in the direction away from the pursuit.  \nElusiveness: Taylor needs two steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill approach. He has an effective \nspin. He can also duck or dip his pads or head with a head fake to set up a bounce. He can make multiple defenders miss in \na short amount of space.  \nVision: Taylor uses movement effectively to freeze unblocked defenders and find open space across the field. He can press \nunblocked defenders to one side and cut back to the other into an open lane. He also sets up blockers with presses.  \nPower: He keeps his feet moving when wrapped high to push forward. He can use his stiff arm to swat through reaches to \nhis frame. He pulls through wraps to his upper and lower legs.  \nTaylor pulls through multiple reads during carries.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Taylor can take a glancing shot from a cornerback to his pads as he catches the target and \nbounce off the hit. He forces the defender to slide down Taylor’s frame to wrap up. Taylor also bounces off glancing shots to \nhis side and pads from a linebacker with a runway.  \nBall Security: Taylor carries the ball high to his chest but loose at the elbow. He carries the ball under his right arm even \nwhen working up the left boundary. He has lost the ball when a defender pulls at his arm.  \nBlocking: Taylor is patient with his approach of cornerbacks with Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man assignments. He \ngenerates a squat and square stance as he approaches. He doesn’t overextend and his hands extend forward.  \nTaylor keeps his feet moving through the contact. He can generate a push. His hands are too wide and he doesn’t punch. He \nattacks with his elbows bent and will hook and turn a safety with Most Dangerous Man blocks.  \nTaylor can tilt into a defender after running him off. He earns a flat position, closes the gap, uses tight hands into the chest, \nkeeps his elbows bent, and moves his feet after earning position.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Taylor from afar. As with many of the prospects in this tier, look for reports that \nTaylor is winning against coverage in scrimmages and consider him a speculative addition for expanded summer rosters.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nA Pair of Clap-Attacks with High-Low Position \n• \nRead-Step, Shed, Stack, and Over the Shoulder \n• \nGood Jump Up and Through But Clap-Drops High-point \n• \nBack Shoulder \n• \nTracking and Boundary Work Issues \n• \nClap-Drop on Fade \n• \nTracking and Pull-Back on Deep Post vs. Tight Coverage \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n250 \nWR Ja’Corey Brooks RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR49 \nJersey No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/184 School: Louisville/Alabama \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: X/Tyler Vaughns \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.6 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nNotre Dame ‘24 \n• \nSMU ‘24 \n• \nUVA ‘24 \n• \nMiami ‘24 \n• \nBC ‘24 \n• \nClemson ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Brooks is like Barney Stinson’s brother from How I Met Your Mother, doing his Kenny Rogers-Dolly \nParton bit, except Rogers and Parton are both good. The duality of Brooks’ game is more Jekyll-Hyde.  \n \nRogers-Parton. Jekyll-Hyde. Equally jarring when performed by one person.  \n \nThis is the case with Brooks. When you watch him run routes, you get excited about his ability to release against press \ncoverage, his extra burst to the ball late in a vertical route, and his man-to-man route skills in the short and intermediate \npassing game.  \n \nThen the ball hits Brooks’ hands. Gradually, the horror creeps into your football-loving soul as you watch more and more \nreps. \n \nLate reactions to the ball. Fading away on jump up and throughs. Suboptimal attack positions. Clap-attacks. Focus drops. \n \nThey’re here. \n \nDo NOT go into the light. Stop where you are. Turn away from it, Don’t even look at it.  \n \nSomebody call Dr. Lesh to cleanse Brooks’ pass-catching, the darkness is has enveloped the bright future of a compelling \nreceiver prospect.  \n \nBrooks is a future starter as a route runner. When he executes with sound technique as a pass-catcher, he has moments \nwhere he looks like a top prospect.  \n \nUntil he exorcises the demons from his pass-catching, all we can do is hope and pray. Until then he’s a smaller Marquez \nValdes-Scantling with more upside and better routes.  \n \nReleases: Brooks has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest tight together \nat his front knee.  \nWhen Brooks releases from the line, he steps off his back foot before rolling off his front foot. There is s sinking into his \nstance to generate a forward lean with his pads over his knees and he pumps his arms at three-quarter range of motion.  \nThere are reps where Brooks doesn’t step off the back foot, but he doesn’t sink into his stance when he performs his release \nthis way.  \nBrooks uses a read step or a hesitation to steal a release in the run game. He also uses a read step with a wipe counter to \nwork inside outside leverage.  \nBrooks displays patience and suddenness when he uses the double up to steal a release. There’s also patience and \nsuddenness with his two-quick and stick combo to steal a release. Another patient and sudden footwork technique Brooks \nuses to steal a release is a hip shift.  \n\n \n251 \nBrooks counters the hands of a defender with a shed when working outside the coverage. His wipe is a violent enough to \nwork past a defender’s jam at the line of scrimmage. He also has a quick swat-swim combination.  \nBrooks uses a two-quick inside and counters with a violent swat, shed, or wipe. He uses a three-quick to get inside. Brooks \nalso has a read step with a double up as part of the combination.  \nHe’s skilled at uncovering from defenders in the end zone when working to an open spot after his initial route doesn’t come \nopen.  \nSeparation: Brooks can earn late separation in the deep game and stack the defender late. He’ll also stack within 10 yards \nof the line of scrimmage.  \nRoute Stems: Brooks attacks off-coverage with outside shade by widening his stems and attacking at full speed. He’ll run \nat the defender and attack the defender’s toes to set up breaks back to the quarterback. He also attacks stems at full \nspeed.  \nRoute Setups: Brooks will use a stick to emphasize an inset at the top of a stem against off-coverage. He also uses a peek \nat the top of stems against off-coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Brooks has a long break step. He uses it well into a drop and pop break and it includes strong deceleration \nthanks to deep weight drop. \nBrooks also uses it well with speed turns breaking inside. He has a flat drive and flat line step. He also snaps his turns and \npunches the arm to the boundary to get that snap.  \nBrooks earns good snap and flat breaks with these drive and line steps on intermediate outs. He has a sharp three-step \nbreak.  \nZone Routes: Brooks recognizes when to uncover in zone coverage in the red zone. He tempos his break effectively. He \nalso knows where to settle. He also knows when to show his eyes to the quarterback after crossing the rollover/buzz \ndefender.  \nRoute Boundary: Brooks is aware of the boundary and can at least get one foot down with targets requiring an athletic \nadjustment.  \nPass Tracking: Brooks tracks the ball over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Brooks can turn back to the ball on a vertical route. He can extend high and wide for targets. He \nuses overhand and underhand attack.  \nBrooks has lapses where he clap-attacks and juggles the ball away. One root problem is a habit of clap-attacking. The other \nis focus. He turns his head downfield before securing the ball into his hands. He also drops the ball due to using suboptimal \nhand position or his hands being too far away at the point of attack.  \nBrooks turns away from his break path and attacks with underhand position at his back hip when needed. He can also make \ncatches high and behind his break path as he turns his back into a hit. He can high-point and retract the ball to his frame in \nquick succession.  \nPosition: Brooks has an effective pullback when catching a target placed behind him with a trailing defender bearing down \non him. He will jump up and through, but he doesn’t use overhand attack and limits the potential range of his positioning. \nHe can embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Brooks can take wraps to his back and hits to his chest as he catches a target. He can take hard shots to his legs \nand maintain possession despite a hit somersaulting him. He wins tight-coverage targets deep—even when tied up with one \narm and using one hand to catch the ball.  \nWhen executing jump up and throughs, Brooks must learn not to fade away when he sees the target will arrive low enough \nfor underhand attack. Brooks must learn to stop, and if anything, force his momentum forward or at worst, still. This will \ngive him position to attack the ball without the opponent earning position to defend the target.  \nTransitions: Brooks practices catch and pierce principles and he obeys the direction of the ball.  \n\n \n252 \nElusiveness: Brooks has small jump cuts to avoid getting his legs into contact.  \nVision: Brooks works to open space and creates additional space against unblocked pursuit. He has a good feel for when to \nsplit defenders.  \nPower: Brooks has a violent stiff arm to swat away reaches to his frame or push the helmet of a defender to the ground.  \nDirect Contact Balance:  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off hits to his back from safeties as he makes the catch.  \nBall Security: Brooks carries the ball high to his chest.  \nBlocking: Brooks can slide inside and deliver his hands with tight position into the chest of an edge defender. It helps him \neffectively shield the defender when he moves his feet. He can work inside out to cut off safeties in the run game.  \nBrooks will run off a defender and then tilt into him to transition from route runner to blocker after the catch.  \nDurability: Missed most of the 2023 season with shoulder injury. He had an ongoing issue with the shoulder and then \naggravated the issue against LSU.   \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar.

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR50 \nJersey No.7 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/210 School: Syracuse/UGA \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: JuJu Smith-Schuster - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.6 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nStanford ‘24 \n• \nUNLV ‘24 \n• \nNC State ‘24 \n• \nPitt ‘24 \n• \nBoston College ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: JuJu Smith-Schuster is the model for Meeks’ game to aspire. Early in his career, Smith-Schuster was a \nsturdy, sure-handed prospect who did his best work against zone coverage, but had enough quickness and speed to match \nup against many forms of man-to-man.  \n \nMeeks is a well-built athlete who does his best work in zone coverage, but has potential to become a legitimate factor \nagainst man-to-man. He uses his size well as a route runner and positions himself to win the ball.  \n \nIf he improves his attack of the football, his potential to develop into an NFL contributor becomes more compelling. Meeks \nwins pinpoint targets. He struggles with tracking and attack when the targets aren’t pinpoint.  \n \nThe same is true if Meeks can refine his release game with more artistry embedded within his execution. With the skills \nMeeks has in his toolbox, he could become better against man if he’s dictating terms early in the route.  \n \nMeeks is what I call a Whiteboard Player. When everything about a play unfolds as drawn up, Meeks has the skills to \nexecute each step to perfection. When the play has unexpected developments and/or doesn’t unfold like the whiteboard, \nMeeks’ game is prone to short-circuiting.  \n \nWhiteboard Players are rarely successful long-term starters unless they possess come compensatory athletic factor that \nearns them match-up advantages. Meeks isn’t that guy, but he can help a team as a reserve who can contribute \nsituationally.  \n \nIf Meeks refines his flaws, he might become a Nick Westbrook-Ikhine type of option who earns a lot of opportunities to \nmake plays as they’re drawn up thanks in part to other talents distracting the defense.   \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Meeks is the split end in the Syracuse offense. He’ll probably be an inside receiver in four- \nand five-receiver sets, but could graduate to outside duty with development.  \nTechnical: There is a lot of clap-attacking with overhand position. Meeks catches most of these targets, but it generally \nproves more difficult to sustain a productive catch with this behavior at an NFL level.  \nReleases: Meeks has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. Meeks’ arms rest on his \nfront knee uncrossed. When he releases from the line of scrimmage, Meeks sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot \nwithout wasted motion.  \nMeeks could sink deeper to get lower off the line. Even without the deeper sink, Meeks gets his pads over his knees. His \narms don’t move at more than two-thirds their maximum range. He’s selling the vertical, but he can do it better.  \nMeeks has a double swat to work past the hands of an outside shade defender. He also has a powerful single swat at the \ntop of his stem before breaking back to the quarterback.  \nMeeks uses a swat-swim that counters of the hands of a defender off a read step when stealing a release in the run game.  \n\n \n254 \nMeeks uses a read step to the outside against outside shade to set up an inside release. He has a violent shed to counter \nthe defender’s hands. He also uses it to get an outside release and with a wipe counter. \nMeeks has a two-quick to set up and outside release and at the top of a short stem, he delivers a violent swat-swim counter \nto the defender’s hands.  \nMeeks uses a stick at the top of his stem against off-coverage to set up breaks. When widening his stem, Meeks can reduce \nhis shoulder from a defender’s hands.  \nMeeks has a shed to counter an outside shade defender’s hands. He uses it to counter his two-quick. He’ll also use a blade \nrelease – a shoulder reduction and shed combo. The move needs more violence.  \nMeeks uses a feet switch to set up an outside release from the line. He uses a double-up to attack outside shade and \ncounters the defender’s hands with a wipe as he breaks inside.  \nAgainst off-coverage with inside shade, Meeks will use a hip shift with a swat-swim hand counter.  \nNone of the release moves cited above have an artistry of patience and suddenness to bait the coverage.  \nSeparation: Meeks must develop a better plan for sideline fades so he doesn’t get pinned to the boundary. Sometimes \nworking inside the man-to-man defender is a better plan.  \nMeeks displays late burst in the vertical game to earn separation during the break to earn the target.  \nRoute Stems: Meeks dives inside to set up out-breaking routes. He could stair-step the route to manipulate defenders \nplaying the zone of the route, but he doesn’t.  \nMeeks widens short stems. He’ll counter with a wipe, but the wipe needs violence so it doesn’t get hung up with the \ndefender.  \nRoute Setups: Meeks will take the back of the defender when given to him. He drops his weight effectively into a two-step \nbreak to sell the hitch-and-go.  \nMeeks will stair step shallow out routes when aligned inside. He uses a peek with a slight head fake and lean to the \nboundary at the top of a stem.  \nRoute Breaks: Meeks has a two-step break, but it lacks weight drop and he leans his torso backward during the break. \nWhen executing short speed breaks, Meeks has a long break step that’s explosive, and drive and line steps that are flat. He \ncan snap the turn on these speed breaks.  \nMeeks snaps his breaks, punching his boundary arm through the turn. He gets his head around to the ball early in the break \nand presents a friendly target while running out the break.  \nMeeks has a quick turn to the quarterback on the drop and pop break during a shallow route, but there’s no weight drop. \nWhen he’s turning inside he can drop his weight. When turning outside, doesn’t as often.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Meeks works with the quarterback to earn separation elsewhere.  \nZone Routes: Meeks identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area of the zone \ntriangle, making a friendly target.  \nRoute Boundary: Meeks is aware of the boundary and gets both toes tapped on a back-shoulder fade.  \nPass Tracking: Meeks leaps unnecessarily for targets at his chest while working over the middle. This slows his break and \nit gives opponents playing over the top an extra 1-2 steps to cut off the target. He has a good feel for extending over his \nhead and maintaining his stride, even as he’s airborne.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Meeks can high-point the ball with a defender on his back and the defender’s hands on Meeks’ \narms. Meeks attacks over hand with the ball at chest height. \nHe extends wide of his frame with overhand position in a tight zone with contact coming to his back and still earns the ball. \nMeeks attacks overhand at helmet level without leaving his feet unnecessarily.  \n\n \n255 \nWhen targets aren’t pinpoint Meeks is prone to clap-attacking the ball and dropping it. His hands are prone to being too \nwide.  \nPosition: Meeks falls backward after a high-point to embrace the fall. He’ll also roll through contact with the ground when \nextending low for the target. Meeks has a good pullback to avoid a linebacker hitting the ball on a target where he’s \nextending toward the LB to make the catch.  \nFocus: Meeks can take contact to his back and arms to win a highpoint. He can take a hard shot to his chest while \nextending toward the linebacker to make the catch.  \nTransitions: Meeks has a good catch and pierce plan \nElusiveness: Meeks has an effective spin to work inside or outside a safety coming downhill for him on a slant. He sets up \nthe spin with a stiff arm. Meeks only needs two quick steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway.  \nVision: Meeks anticipates unblocked defenders shooting for his frame in the open field. He’ll work into unblocked traffic to \nfinish a play, earning what he can get.  \nPower: Meeks runs through reaches to his legs below the knees. He has an effective stiff arm to ward off defender’s trying \nto wrap his body. He has good placement with the stiff arm to the defender’s chest. This helps him generate a push \ndownfield while keeping his legs moving after contact.  \nMeeks finishes with low pad level, running through reaches and bouncing off hits.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Meeks can stalemate a direct hit in the chest from an off-ball linebacker.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Meeks can bounce off glancing shots from defensive backs.  \nBall Security: Meeks tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm. He also carries it high to his frame. He’ll switch the ball to \nhis boundary arm as he works away from pursuit that led him to carry it in the opposite arm. Meeks takes contact to his \nball-carrying arm and maintains security.  \nBlocking: When handling Man Over Me assignments, Meeks earns square and squat position. He shuffles his feet laterally \nwith a wide stance. When he spots an angle to attack, he overextends with his pads and helmet to take the air out of the \ninteraction. His hands are wide, but he has the size and intensity of attack to move a cornerback off the spot and initially \ncontrol the interaction with the momentum of the strike.  \nWhen executing Most Dangerous Man assignments, Meeks loads up the forearm and leads with one pad into the safety. \nWhen he’s accurate, the strike has power and stifles the defender.  \nMeeks can take hard contact from a safety as long as he’s also bringing his own. Overall, Meeks’ hands are too wide when \nhe attacks and he doesn’t show any reps where he delivers a technically-sound punch.  \nDurability: Meeks suffered a hairline fracture in his foot that required offseason surgery before 2024 season. He missed \nspring practice and multiple weeks in 2023.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Meeks from afar, but know he could develop into a speculative match-up play if \nhe sticks with a roster and his playing time gradually increases.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nClap Drop of Target Wide and Behind Break Path \n• \nExtension into oncoming LB and Pullback \n• \nHighpoint on Crosser \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n256",
        "analysis": "Jackson Meeks is a WR prospect with a ceiling comparable to a situational contributor, potentially developing into a player like Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.  His game is heavily reliant on the play being executed precisely as designed (\"Whiteboard Player\").\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:**  Meeks possesses good size (6'2\", 210 lbs) and can high-point the ball effectively, even with defenders in tight coverage. He excels at winning pinpoint targets.\n* **Route Running (in Zone):** He's proficient at running routes, particularly in zone coverage, using his size to his advantage and positioning himself well for the catch.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a blocker, particularly in man-over-man situations, leveraging his size and intensity.\n* **After the Catch:** Possesses some elusiveness with a useful spin move and can navigate traffic to gain extra yardage.\n* **Technical Skills (Fundamentals):** Displays a solid understanding of release techniques, including various counters against different coverage types.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Consistency:** His performance is highly variable.  He struggles when plays break down or targets aren't precise, often leading to drops due to \"clap-attacking\" the ball.  Improving his consistency and adaptability is crucial for his development.\n* **Release Artistry:** While his release techniques are present, they lack the artistry and subtlety to consistently beat man coverage.  Developing more nuanced moves would significantly elevate his game.\n* **Pass Tracking (Inconsistent):**  His ability to track the ball is inconsistent; he sometimes jumps unnecessarily for catchable balls, hindering his ability to make plays.\n* **Man Coverage:**  Needs improvement against man-to-man coverage; while he has the potential, he needs refinement in his route running and release techniques to consistently win in this scenario.\n* **Durability:** A history of injuries (foot fracture) raises concerns about his long-term health.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Primary:** JuJu Smith-Schuster (early career):  This comparison highlights Meeks' strengths in size, sure-handedness (when consistent), and ability in zone coverage. However, Meeks lacks Smith-Schuster's overall athleticism and consistency.\n* **Potential Ceiling:** Nick Westbrook-Ikhine:  This comparison reflects Meeks' potential as a rotational receiver who excels when plays are well-executed and the defense is occupied elsewhere.  This is a more realistic projection given his limitations.\n\n**Overall:**  Meeks has the physical tools and some technical skills to be a late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent.  His development hinges on improving his consistency, refining his release techniques to become more effective against man coverage, and addressing his pass-tracking issues.  He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect with a relatively low floor but limited potential for significant upside.\n"

He’s a quick athlete with slick moves in traffic \nand in the open field.  \n \nThe athletic ability Moore displays reminds me of players like Doug Baldwin and Khalil Shakir, but his hands don’t. Moore \nleaves his feet unnecessarily for targets, which is a sign of unconfident tracking.  \n \nTracking might be the root issue with Moore’s lapses as a pass receiver. He has too many reps where he doesn’t use the \nattack best-suited for the target’s trajectory. When this happens, his hands get too wide and he clap-attacks the ball.  \n \nWhen Moore is confident with his tracking, he uses the best attack and his hands are tight. In these instances, Moore makes \ncatches that you’d expect from an aspiring professional.  \n \nMoore’s route-running is good. He can win against tight man-to-man coverage with sound technique and craft. He’s quick \nenough to earn separation early in routes and stack defenders.  \n \nMoore just might have enough athletic ability to expand or transcend his slot role with a team provided he proves reliable \nwith his hands. \n \nDoug Baldwin wasn’t built in a day. If Moore sticks with a roster, keep an eye out.   \n \nReleases: Moore has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring their front foot. His hands hang at either \nside of their front knee. \nWhen Moore releases, he has a small number of reps where he sinks into his stance. More often he doesn’t, but he gets his \npads over his knees and rolls off his front foot. Moore’s arms move at about half their full range of motion. When running a \nvertical route against a deep cushion, his arms move at three-quarters their range of motion.  \nThere’s a slight rock off the back foot when he begins his release.  \nMoore reduces his shoulder from the reach of outside leverage. He has a read step with a shed counter.  \nMoore has a long stick at the top of his stem. He uses a two-quick or three-quick to steal a release. Moore has a double up \nagainst off-coverage. None of these moves have an artistry of patience and suddenness.  \nHe has a stick with a wipe counter.  \nMoore can be patient with a hesitation and read step and sudden with a wipe. The problem is that his footwork is slow and \nthe counter is fast. It’s predictable. He must vary the pacing off the footwork.  \nMoore combines a quick two with a double up and counters defenders with a double swat. Moore has a quick-two with a \nwipe counter.  \nSeparation: Moore will stack a cornerback off a double move. He’ll stack corners within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage \non single-break vertical routes as well.  \n\n \n257 \nRoute Stems: Moore plays with pacing between his initial release and his stems. He does this most often with shallow \nroutes.  \nRoute Setups: Moore has an effective inset that includes a turn of the head inside as well as his hips and chest. He leans \ninside effectively at the top of his stem. He combines a two-quick with the inset. \nHe uses a peek at the top of stems that lead to a break inside.  \nRoute Breaks: Moore’s three-step breaks against zone coverage lack a long break step and weight drop. When facing a \ndeep cushion and running a deep out, Moore can drop his weight out of a long break step and deliver a three-step break \nwith flat drive and line steps to work back to the ball.  \nMoore also has a long break step into a drop and pop break with good weight drop. He snaps his turns into hitches.  \nZone Routes: Moore identifies the zone triangle and the second-level defender. He works to depth and settles into the \nopen area. He creates a friendly target.  \nMoore doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback on routes breaking over the middle until he has crossed the buzz/rollover \ndefender.  \nRoute Boundary: Moore can toe tap both feet inbounds while leaning outside the sideline as he catches the ball over his \nhead. He can tap one toe in bounds for high-points away from his frame against tight coverage. He can also drag one foot \ninbounds after leaving his feet for the ball.  \nPass Tracking: Moore leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at chest and shoulder level against tight coverage. He has \nlate hands.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Moore attacks targets away from his frame at chest-height with underhand position, which \nminimizes his full potential range. The position is also too wide and he clap-attacks.  \nWhen he keeps his position tighter, Moore can win targets where he’s forced to extend his arms for it. He can also fully \nextend his body for the ball and get parallel with the ground.  \nMoore also clap-attacks with underhand attack at his chest when he could be attacking early and it with overhand attack.  \nMoore can high-point at his back shoulder on breaks working across the middle. He can extend fully with his frame for \ntargets low and away on slants against tight coverage at his back.  \nPosition: Moore has a pullback and embraces the fall. He will jump up and through, but he uses underhand position tight to \nhis frame rather than attacking with overhand position. He can embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Moore can high-point and take contact to his back or make the play against tight coverage at the boundary.  \nTransitions: Moore obeys the ball and catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: Moore can undercut unblocked defenders as he works across the field. He can decelerate and jump cut away \nfrom backside pursuit. He has good stop-start movement. His spin is tight and effective.  \nHe layers moves in succession. He only needs two-quick steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill \nrunway.  \nVision: Moore has good feel for pursuit over the top and backside pursuit. He’s an efficient mover who can make dynamic \nmoves while still heading downhill. He also has a good feel for creating space in tight traffic with multiple unblocked \ndefenders. He’s creates, patient, and decisive.  \nHe will attempt bounces and cutbacks at the expense of taking what’s in front of him. Especially in down and distance \nsituations where it would benefit him to be more conservative.  \nPower: Moore drops his pads under pursuit. He uses a stiff-arm to ward off contact to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate contact from a safety in the open field.  \n\n \n258 \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a safety in the open field.  \nBall Security: Moore can take a hit to his ball-carrying arm. His elbow is loose from his side. He can switch the ball to his \nboundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Moore is quick to slide laterally to reach his assignment with a squat and square position. Moore takes the air out \nof the interaction between then. His elbows are bent when he gets his hands on the defender. \nHe overextends with his pads and helmet when his elbows are bent. Moore also overextends with straight arms when he \ndoesn’t get close enough. This prevents Moore from sustaining blocks.  \nMoore moves his feet after contact.  \nWith Most Dangerous Man assignments, Moore will square a linebacker and keep his arms tight as he aims for the chest of \nthe defender.  \nWith Man Over Me assignments, Moore doesn’t drop his weight into a squat stance. He doesn’t overextend, but he doesn’t \nclose the gap as tight as he could. He gets his hands inside the arms of his opponent and he runs his feet.  \nDurability: Moore dealt with an undisclosed injury in 2024 that limited his playing time, but he didn’t miss games.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Moore from afar, but if he’s looking like a good bet to make a roster and there is \nno conversation about dropped passes, make a speculative bid for him off waivers.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLong break step, weight drop, three-step break, flat drive and line steps, and catch at boundary \n• \nJump up and through versus contact \n• \nOne-handed highpoint \n• \nInset, weight-drop, late hands but lacking uniform attack, pullback, boundary work \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n259",
        "analysis": "## Jordan Moore - Player Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Athleticism and Quickness:** Moore possesses impressive athleticism and quickness, reminiscent of players like Doug Baldwin and Khalil Shakir. This allows him to create separation, especially in the slot.  He excels at stacking cornerbacks, both on vertical routes and double moves.\n* **Route Running:**  He demonstrates sound route-running technique, capable of winning against tight man coverage.  His route stems show good pacing, particularly on shallow routes.  He utilizes effective insets and peeks to create separation.\n* **Elusiveness and Vision:**  Moore is an elusive runner after the catch, possessing good stop-start movement, a tight spin, and the ability to layer moves. He demonstrates good vision and feel for creating space in traffic, though he sometimes prioritizes flashy plays over conservative ones.\n* **Blocking:** While needing improvement, Moore shows potential as a blocker, displaying quick lateral movement and the ability to square up linebackers.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Hand Usage:** Moore's biggest weakness is his inconsistent hand-eye coordination and catch technique. He often leaves his feet unnecessarily and employs an inefficient \"clap-attack\" instead of a more secure, overhand catch.  Improving this area would significantly elevate his draft stock.\n* **Consistency:** While he showcases flashes of brilliance, he lacks consistency in his performance. Refining his route running and ball-tracking would make him a more reliable receiver.\n* **Expanding Beyond the Slot:**  While projected as a slot receiver, his athleticism suggests potential to play outside, but this hinges on improved reliability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report lists a spectrum of comparisons:\n\n* **Doug Baldwin:**  Shares Baldwin's quickness and ability to win in tight spaces, though Baldwin had notably better hands.  The comparison highlights Moore's potential but emphasizes the work needed to reach that level.\n* **Khalil Shakir:**  Similar athletic profile and potential as a slot receiver.\n* **Connor Wedington & Kendall Hinton:** These comparisons likely place Moore on the lower end of the spectrum, suggesting a potential role as a depth player rather than a star.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nMoore is a talented slot receiver prospect with the athleticism to be a contributor at the NFL level.  However, his inconsistent hands and need for improved ball-tracking are significant concerns. His development hinges on solidifying his catching ability; if he does so, he could exceed expectations. Otherwise, he's likely a late-round pick or undrafted free agent who needs to demonstrate reliability to make a roster.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR52 \nJersey No. 11 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/195 School: Miami (Fl)/Houston/WVU  \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Romeo Doubs - Jalen Tolbert – Joshua Cephus/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.1 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nBrown is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUSF ‘24 \n• \nCal ‘24 \n• \nLouisville ’24  \n• \nFSU ‘24 \n• \nDuke ‘24 \n• \nGeorgia Tech ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Romeo Doubs is the refined version of what Samuel Brown could be with a lot of work, and a lot of \nluck. Suspended for immature behavior in 2022 just before the Independence Bowl, Brown is an excellent athlete who wins \nmore often on the basis of his physical skills than his positional acumen.  \n \nThe positive side of that truth is that if Brown wants to become a better wide receiver, he has more to learn than he has to \n“unlearn.” This is true with a lot of facets of his game.  \n \nBrown has release moves, but they lack the artistry to make them sing. He can fly past defenders, but must learn to stack.  \n \nBrown even has an effective setup technique during his stems. Now, he just has to learn more of them.  \n \nThese examples can be found from the release through the breaks of Brown’s routes. What he knows how to do, he does \nwell or just needs to add more refinement. What he doesn’t do, he can learn and has the physical capacity to perform it.  \n \nThe important exception with this them with Brown’s game is his hands. Brown must curtail the clap-attacking and replace \nthis with sound attacks. It would also be helpful if Brown learns to jump up and through with underthrown routes.  \n \nIf Brown can develop the timing with his positioning to the ball with his body and his hands, the route work will be the easy \npart. Brown is a starter-caliber athlete. If an NFL team determines that Brown is an empty canvas and Brown proves them \nright that he’s willing to do the work in and out of the facility, he has all the raw materials to become a fast climber.  \n \nIt’s unlikely, but worth monitoring.  \n \nReleases: Brown has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands are above his \nknee with his arms bent and hands close together but uncrossed.  \nBrown sinks into his stance to begin his release from the line of scrimmage. He must curtail the slight rocking off the back \nfoot. His pads come over his knees with his head up as he begins his release. As the season progressed, Brown had fewer \nrelease reps with wasted motion.  \nHis arms move at about one-third the full range of motion so he can sell the vertical potential of a route better than he \ndoes.  \nBrown uses a feet-switch to release outside tight man coverage. He counters the defender’s hands with a wipe or shoulder \nreduction when working inside. He can combine a quick-two, a hip shift, and a stick to work against off-coverage. \nBrown uses a read step to steal a release in the run game.  \nBrown has a double up off the line but the steps lack exaggeration/range of movement and the pacing is the same with \nboth. He must develop more artistry with patience and suddenness.  \n\n \n260 \nHe can pair a double up with a hesitation to begin the combination. He uses a two-quick to attack a defender’s inside \nleverage. Against  the jam, he can deliver a feet switch and reduce his shoulder from the contact.  \nHe’ll also pair up two-quicks and add a stick at the end.  \nBrown has an effective swat-swim counter of a press defender’s hands after delivering a read step to attack inside leverage. \nHe has an effective trigger step that’s sudden and he will use two during the stem to set up a release inside.  \nBrown’s read step and shoulder reduction is a good combo for him to get outside. He uses a shed to counter a defender’s \nhands from the outside.  \nHe uses a stick and wipe counter against off-coverage to work inside.  \nSeparation: If he gets behind a zone cornerback and safety, Brown can flip the field and breakaway from these defenders \nas well as the middle of the field safety. This can lead to gains of more than 75 yards.  \nRoute Stems: Brown works into the feet and the back of the off-coverage defender to set up routes breaking back to the \nquarterback. He’ll widen a step to turn a defender’s hips before taking the defender’s back or breaking behind the defender \nand to the inside.  \nRoute Setups: Brown uses an inset and dips his head and pads to the inside at the top of his stems to set up a vertical \nroute or a deeper route like a curl.  \nRoute Breaks: When running short hitches, Brown is prone to pushing off at the top of the stem while delivering a break \nstep. He must resist that urge and deliver a break step with deeper weight drop and attack the stem with more speed. He’s \nnot getting the separation he desires with the push-off.  \nBrown breaks back to the quarterback on curl routes. He has a drop and pop break with a break step, but the weight drop \ncan be deeper with some drop and pops, but he has shown he can get that weight drop with intermediate routes.  \nBrown’s three-step breaks need more weight drop but he works back to the quarterback out of the break. His turns need \nsnap. He finishes with a friendly target to the quarterback.  \nHe has flat drive and line steps on speed outs.  \nZone Routes: Brown tempos his breaks to the flat on speed outs. He presents a friendly target. He also knows where to \nsettle against the zone triangle. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, Brown continues working to the open area. He \ndoesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he has cleared the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Brown can toe-tap the boundary while backing his way toward the sideline or take moderate contact to \nhis back as he breaks close to the sideline.  \nPass Tracking: Brown tracks the ball over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Brown can extend his arms above and away from his front shoulder to catch a target. He uses \nunderhand position at his beltline.  \nHe clap-traps targets at the chest on wide routes and it has led to him fighting the ball and losing 1-2 steps to get downhill \nand avoid traffic.  \nHe can high-point at the earliest point of the target, but he also has bouts of clap-drops when high-pointing.  \nPosition: Brown can fully extends and clap-attack a target away from his frame with a defender wrapped around his back \nand/waist and make the initial catch. He can embrace the fall but it’s more difficult for him to do with contact and he has \nlost catches because if it.  \nBrown has opportunities to jump up and through on vertical routes, but opts to turn his torso back and use underhand \nattack, which gives the trailing defender better position and leads to drops.  \nFocus: Brown can take light to moderate contact to his back as he attacks the ball over his shoulder or high-points.  \nTransitions: Brown will catch and pierce to transition downhill. He must do so with greater consistency. \n\n \n261 \nElusiveness: Brown has a tight spin to the inside. Instead of lower his pads into an oncoming safety, Brown tries to spin \naway from contact.  \nBrown has sudden hip shifts and jukes to beat unblocked defenders in open space. He uses shoulder fakes effectively. He \ncan make multiple moves in tight space, including jump cuts and spins. He combines moves in layers that can be effective.  \nHe gets his feet over low shots. When working to the boundary, he can transition downhill with just one step.  \nVision: Brown displays patience against three unblocked defenders. He can press one lane to set up a cutback with a spin \nto reach the crease. Even if the result is a minimal gain, Brown shows feel for how to create space. He’ll split blockers as \nnecessary.  \nPower: Brown finishes runs with low pad level. He pulls through reaches or wraps to his legs and upper body. He keeps his \nfeet moving when wrapped high. He can keep his feet when wrapped high and help generate a push if help arrives.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Brown can bounce off glancing shots to his pads and legs from cornerbacks and safeties.  \nBall Security: Brown carries the ball high to his chest. The elbow is loose from his side. He carries the ball under his right \narm regardless of the side of the field he’s running or the angle of the pursuit. Brown can take contact to the ballcarrying \narm.  \nBlocking: With Man Over Me assignments, Brown keeps his hands tight and aims for the chest with a double jab. When he \nfollows up his initial strike, he overextends and can miss the defender. He must close the gap tighter.  \nWhen Brown runs off a defender and tilts into him, he closes the gap well. When this happens, Brown’s hands are in tight \nposition on the chest plate and it gives him leverage to turn the defender. He moves his feet well enough to control the man \nand sustain contact. This also has to do with Brown cultivating a wide base.  \nWhen Brown has lapses with Man Over Me assignments, he doesn’t close the gap enough to sustain his hands and position \non the defender after the initial contact.  \nWhen running Most Dangerous Man assignments, Brown earns a flat position, closes the gap, and delivers a hard punch on \nthe safety. He rolls his hips upward through the punch. Regardless of block type, Brown is patient with his approach \ndownhill so he doesn’t overcommit too early and lose position. He gets close to the assignment and forces the assignment \nto come to him at the final distance.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Brown is worth monitoring from afar for 2-3 seasons as long as there’s evidence of \nprogress with his development. If you hear about his reliability as a route runner and winning the ball, it could be time to \ntake a speculative shot.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSamuel Brown Trigger Step \n• \nSamuel Brown Trap Attack and Wastes the Play \n• \nSamuel Brown Clap-attack on High-point over Middle \n• \nSchemed Play and Flips the Field \n• \nSpin and YAC \n• \nSteals A Release, Tilt Technique \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n262",
        "analysis": "Samuel Brown is a WR prospect with intriguing athleticism and raw talent, but significant refinement is needed before he can become a reliable NFL contributor.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Athleticism:** Brown possesses excellent speed, allowing him to create separation deep and flip the field. He also shows flashes of impressive agility and elusiveness after the catch.\n* **Physical Tools:** His size (6'2\", 195 lbs) and arm length give him a large catch radius.  He can high-point the ball effectively at times.\n* **Route Running Fundamentals:** While needing refinement, Brown demonstrates a basic understanding of route running concepts, including release techniques (feet-switch, shoulder reduction, stick, etc.) and route stems.  He shows ability to work back to the QB on curls.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Polish:**  His releases and breaks lack artistry and consistency.  He needs to improve his pacing, weight transfer, and overall precision in his routes to create more consistent separation.\n* **Hand Technique:** His \"clap-attacking\" approach to catching the ball leads to inconsistencies and dropped passes.  Developing a more sound and reliable hand technique is crucial.\n* **Ball Tracking:** While he can track the ball over his shoulder, improving his ability to \"jump up and through\" on underthrown balls would significantly improve his catching ability.\n* **Consistency and Maturity:**  His past suspension highlights concerns about maturity and consistency.  Proving his reliability on and off the field will be key to his success.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scout compares Brown to Romeo Doubs, Jalen Tolbert, and Joshua Cephus.  This suggests a player with potential but significant development needed.  Doubs is the highest ceiling comparison, implying Brown *could* reach that level with significant improvement, but Tolbert and Cephus represent the more likely outcomes – players with some success but significant limitations.  The comparison highlights a wide range of potential outcomes depending on his development and refinement.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBrown possesses the physical tools to be an NFL receiver, but his development is paramount.  He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect whose future hinges on his willingness and ability to refine his technique and demonstrate maturity.  He is a project player that requires patience and coaching.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR53 \nJersey: No. 11 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11/196 School: Ole Miss/Louisville \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Brandin Cooks-Randall Cobb - - X \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.1 = Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. Watkins is on \nthe cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nGaTech ‘23 \n• \nAlabama ’23  \n• \nTexas A&M ‘23 \n• \nGeorgia ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Watkins earned a scouting report in the 2024 RSP because there was thought he might declare. He’s a \nspeedster who does his best work when matched against safeties, but he improved his route game in 2024.  \n \nWatkins is doing a better job using releases with hand counters at the line of scrimmage and executing them with better \ncraft. That craft is also showing up more often with his setup of defenders during his stems as well as a ball carrier after the \ncatch.  \n \nWatkins must continue working on his hands. He’s prone to using underhand attack with too many targets where an \noverhand attack will be the difference between a catch and a drop in the NFL.  \n \nBecause of his speed and ball-carrying, Watkins could complete for a role on special teams and continue working at his craft \nto become more involved in an NFL offense. \n \nWatkins’ draft capital won’t be high enough for him to likely fight through the team politics to compete for a significant role. \nHe’ll need to improve significantly and he’ll need a major event happening on the roster that forces the staff to consider him \nas more than a return specialist and reserve.  \n \nCrazier things have happened. Watkins is a low-end contributor, at best right now, but the fact that he improved this year \nand has a potential value to earn a roster spot is worth remembering.  \n \nWhere is the player inconsistent? The appropriate arm to carry the ball. Leaving his feet unnecessarily.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Watkins is used a lot as a check-down or leak option from the slot or the backfield. He’s \nalso used up the seams against zone coverage for intermediate and vertical shots. He’s also used as the receiver earning \nlate motion prior to the snap. He has experience with punt returns.  \nConceptual: He leaves his feet on targets at the numbers or beltline \nReleases: Watkins has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang uncrossed at \nthe front knee. When he begins his release, he rocks off his back foot. He must work on sinking lower into his stance and \nrolling off the front foot without wasted motion as the norm and not the exception.  \nWatkins will use a wipe or a shed at the top of his stem on a vertical route to counter than hands of his opponent. He’ll \nreduce his shoulder to get outside. I haven’t seen him combine hands and feet with releases in three games in 2023, but he \nshowed he could combine them in 2024 – including a two-quick and a wipe counter and a double-up and wipe counter.  \nHe has a sudden read step to work off the line against tight man-to-man coverage. His double up is effective against outside \nshade coverage to work inside but he could cultivate a greater contrast between patience and suddenness.  \nHis patience and suddenness is effective when incorporating it into his read step and a wipe counter.  \nHe’ll also use a pair of hesitation steps inside to setup an out-breaking route. He pairs two-quicks in succession with \ndifferent paces to set up an inside release.  \n\n \n263 \nWatkins will use the read step to steal a release.  \nSeparation: Watkins has the speed to get open 40 yards downfield against off-man coverage and maintain his separation \nagainst defensive backs for another 30 yards, if not more.  \nRoute Stems: Watkins will dive inside his coverage to set up breaks outside. He’ll also widen his stem to set up a route \ninside a defender coming downhill from over the top.  \nRoute Setups: He’ll take the back of the defender when it’s given to him. He does a nice job with pace chances during his \nstem in the red zone. He can deliver a double move with a hitch and go that includes an inset with weight drop.  \nRoute Breaks: He has quick turns on speed breaks with flat drive and line steps, but he can cultivate more snap to the \nturn with a punch of the boundary arm. He gets his head around fast.  \nHe also rounds off breaks on intermediate digs and allow defenders to undercut the target from trail position or cut off the \nball from over the top because he’s drifting.  \nWatkins has a quick three-step break with weight drop out of long break step. He can get more snap on the turn back to the \nquarterback.  \nZone Routes: Watkins identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area while making a \nfriend target. When working across zone defenders, he will tempo his breaks. He’ll work back to the quarterback his route \ndoesn’t break open or the quarterback must break the pocket.  \nIn 2023, Watkins had to learn to keep his eyes off the quarterback until he has passes the buzz defender. He showed \nimprovement with this in 2024.  \nRoute Boundary:  Watkins can shorten his stride to get both feet inbounds on a short route. He can toe-tap one foot \ninbounds during a high-point and pushed in the back.  \nPass Tracking: Watkins tracks the ball over his shoulder on vertical routes, and he’ll turn back to catch the ball thrown a \nlittle behind him while still running downhill. He leaves his feet unnecessarily to catch targets at numbers height. He has \nlate hands when tracking fades over his shoulder against tight coverage.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Watkins can catch the ball underhand at his beltline while breaking toward the boundary. He can \nhigh-point away from his break path, including behind his break and turn through the catch to get downhill.  \nWatkins leans too much on underhand attack with targets thrown behind his frame when he should use overhand and attack \nat an earlier point, especially when there is trail coverage that could knock the ball loose or allow the ball into his body.  \nHe can extend with underhand attack to catch the ball at knee height. He also has lapses with using clap-attacks.  \nFocus: Watkins can catch the ball over the middle in a tight window and take contact to his back. He earns fades against \ntight coverage.  \nElusiveness: Watkins has the quick feet to transition downhill from an out route near the boundary, getting both feet \ninbounds and then jump-cutting inside pursuit from over the top. If a defender makes contact, he can spin outside the \nopponent and get into open space. He has efficient moves to work in tight spaces and layer them together.  \nVision: He plays with pacing effectively in the open field so he can defeat pursuit angles.  \nPower: Watkins has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches in the open field and he’ll keep his feet moving through \nreaches and wraps.  \nDirect Balance: I didn’t see any instances where Watson demonstrated direct balance. \nIndirect Balance: Watson bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks. \nBall Security: Watkins s default arm is his left and that includes working up the right boundary with pursuit on his left. He \ncan carry the ball under his right arm and will switch it there when traffic isn’t heavy. He will carry the ball high to his chest.  \n\n \n264 \nBlocking: Watkins is a good Man Over Me blocker when he transitions from route runner to blocker. He earns a square \nposition with a low center of gravity and shoots his hands with his elbows bent. He earns a chest-to-chest position, taking \nthe air away that’s between then. He moves his feet well to drive a defender away from the ball carrier.  \nWatkins doesn’t overextend and because he closes the gap well, his collisions with the assignment have some impact, but \nhis hands are too wide and there’s no real punch as a result. When he delivers his hands tight enough, he can get a punch \ninto the chest of the opponent, but he must learn to roll through the hips to generate force.  \nWatkins can break down too late against safeties and linebackers on Most Dangerous Man Assignments and this allows a \ndefender a free lane to the inside.  \nHis effort on crack backs is admirable. He earns tight position to the shoulder of the defender and generates a push, \nworking hard to sustain the position as long as possible.  \nWatkins doesn’t do it enough but he can get a flat lead to cut off his opponents when sealing the inside.  \nHe has some skill with turning a defender inside or outside once he has engaged with a tight position. He’s better downfield \nthan he is near the line of scrimmage. Defenders of all types shed Watkins easily when he’s near the line.  \nDurability: Watkins injured his hand against Auburn in 2023. Still played through it—heavily tapping it and wearing a small \ncast. He required surgery on the right hand and had two plates inserted.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Watkins from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nJordan Watkins 2023 Ole Miss Highlights \n• \nJordan Watkins 2024 Ole Miss Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n265",
        "analysis": "## Jordan Watkins - Player Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elite Speed:** Watkins possesses exceptional speed, allowing him to consistently gain separation downfield, especially against off-man coverage.  He can maintain this separation for significant yardage.\n* **Improved Route Running:** While needing further refinement, Watkins demonstrates noticeable improvement in his route running, utilizing various releases (wipe, shed, double-up) and stems to create separation.  He shows proficiency in zone route concepts.\n* **Ball Tracking:**  Watkins effectively tracks the ball over his shoulder on deep routes and can adjust to slightly behind throws.  He can high-point the ball away from his break path.\n* **After the Catch:** He displays good elusiveness, quick feet, and efficient moves in tight spaces, allowing him to create yards after the catch.  He effectively uses a stiff arm to ward off tacklers.\n* **Blocking Potential:** Though inconsistent, he shows promise as a blocker, particularly in man-over-me situations, displaying good hand placement and footwork when he executes properly.  His effort on crack backs is noteworthy.\n* **Special Teams Value:** His speed and ball-carrying skills make him a potential contributor on special teams, particularly punt returns.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refined Route Running:** Further development of route precision and consistency in his breaks could significantly elevate his game.  Eliminating drifting on intermediate routes is key.\n* **Hand Technique:** Improving his hand usage (overhand catch) will reduce drops and improve his ability to secure contested catches.\n* **Increased Role:**  A roster injury or a team's need for a speed receiver could open opportunities for a significant role beyond special teams.\n* **Consistency:** Eliminating inconsistencies in his ball-carrying arm and unnecessary leaving of his feet would greatly improve his overall performance.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Hand Technique:** Prone to underhand catches, leading to drops, especially when trail coverage is present. Needs to develop more consistent overhand technique.\n* **Route Running Consistency:** While improved, inconsistencies remain in his route breaks, allowing defenders to undercut routes or cut off the ball.\n* **Ball Security:**  While generally secure, his default left arm preference could be a vulnerability.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** Inconsistent hand placement and lack of a strong punch limit his effectiveness as a blocker, especially near the line of scrimmage.\n* **Durability:**  History of hand injuries raises a concern.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares him to Brandin Cooks and Randall Cobb. This makes sense given his speed and ability as a slot receiver, though he currently lacks the polished route running and consistency of either player.  He's more likely a low-end contributor like Cobb in his less successful seasons, rather than a true Cooks-level deep threat.  His current ceiling is closer to a high-potential backup or special teams ace than a consistent starter.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR54 \nJersey No. 5 / No. 80 \nHeight/Weight: 6’3”/202 School: Notre Dame / Clemson \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Tee Higgins – Mike Williams – - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nCollins is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nTexas A&M ‘24 \n• \nStanford ‘24 \n• \nGT ‘24 \n• \nDuke ‘23 \n• \nFSU ‘23 \n• \nWF ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Collins is a career reserve who can produce when the plays unfold as designed. He has a nice toolbox \nof release maneuvers and stems against press coverage, enough route acumen to get open in zone coverage, and hands \ngood enough to catch the ball when it’s pinpoint accurate.  \n \nCollins’ breaks that require deceleration, weight drop, and sharp speed turns all need improvement. He’s not going beat NFL \ndefenders with timing routes without addressing these problems.  \n \nCollins also has issues with positioning himself favorably in tight coverage at the catch point. He gives away the advantage \nof his size at the boundary or when thrown open because he doesn’t time his positioning effectively.  \n \nCollins also has lapses with how he attacks the ball—using the incorrect attack technique for the trajectory of the target and \nclap-attacking – when he’s dealing with tight coverage and contested plays.  \n \nCollins could serve as a fourth or fifth receiver or short-term as an injury substitute in the starting lineup because there’s \nenough route skills for him to be where he’s supposed to be.  \n \nIf he wants any shot at becoming a regular contributor, Collins must become more explosive and address the sloppiness \nwith breaks, positioning himself to the ball, and attacking the ball.  \n \nReleases: Collins has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side \nof his front knee. When he begins his release in 2023, he sinks into his stance, but he rocks off his back foot before rolling \noff the front foot. In 2024, he’s executing more reps where there’s little to no rock off the back foot.  \nHis arms at two-thirds the complete range of movement. His head and eyes are up with his pads over his knees.  \nCollins counters the hands of a defender with a double swat, but the movement requires more precision and violence to be \neffective. Collins’ blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed combination – is effective.  \nCollins uses a two-quick to attack an off-coverage defender at the top of his stem. He’ll also uses it against tighter coverage \nand counter with a wipe, double swat, or a shoulder reduction.  \nHe has a stutter release to get outside defenders at the line. He uses a read step to work inside. He pairs a two-quick with a \nread step to get outside a defender.  \nCollins has a throw by with a swim counter. He has a single-swat counter to a defender’s hands.   \nCollins uses a feet-switch to steal a release in the run game. He also uses a two-quick and double up together. Collins has a \nhesitation and two-quick combo that’s patient and sudden. He counters with a wipe.  \n\n \n266 \nSeparation: Collins does not get early separation against man-to-man coverage. His best chance at separation against \nman-to-man coverage is double moves and play action. He can stack intermediate routes after diving inside a defender. \nHowever, I’ve only seen him stack a defender twice in six games over two years – both against Stanford.  \nRoute Stems: Collins will dive toward inside leverage. He attacks his stems at full speed against off-coverage defenders. \nHe’ll take the back of the defender to set up breaks back to the quarterback.  \nRoute Setups: Collins will deliver a head fake to the safety to set up a potential break downfield when about to break \nacross the middle on a deep over route.  \nCollins uses a stick at the top of a stem to set up a break inside an off-coverage defender with outside leverage. After diving \ninside with his stems, he can deliver an inset before breaking downhill.  \nRoute Breaks: With short-range drop and pop breaks, Collins has a long break step but there’s no weight drop. When \nrunning an intermediate curl, he’ll drop and pop with weight drop but no break step.  \nHe has weight drop into a three-step break without a long break step.  \nCollins breaks so his head and frame are in a friendly position to the target. He can snap his breaks back to the quarterback \nwith the punch of the boundary arm. He must do this with shallow breaks against off-coverage even when he’s not earning \nthe ball. It can help him set up other routes.  \nCollins drifts out of intermediate speed breaks. The drive step is flat, but his line step isn’t and he drifts 3-4 yards out of the \nbreak step. When the coverage over the top is clearly tight enough to threaten the target, Collins delivers flat drive and line \nsteps and works back to the ball out of the break.  \nZone Routes: Collins identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the open zone. He \nwaits to show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. When his first break doesn’t earn \na target, he works to an open area—running or sliding incrementally into open space.  \nRoute Boundary: Collins can toe-tap to stay inbounds near the sideline.  \nPass Tracking: Collins leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at helmet level. He can turn away from an out route and \ntrack over his shoulder. His tracking with back-shoulder targets seems to be a step off from where the target arrives – \neither too far inside/outside.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Collins can turn behind his break path and catch the target at his back shoulder with overhand \nattack. He can make one-handed catches against tight coverage behind his break path and switch the ball during the \npullback to the other hand.  \nWhen high-pointing, Collins can have lapses with clap-attacks and drop the ball. He can catch with underhand technique at \nthe numbers. He has lapses with underhand attack—either when not to use it or executing it effectively. When he gets his \nunderhand attack right, he can dig out low targets below his knees.  \nPosition: Collins embraces the fall when pulled to the ground. He has an effective pullback when executing a jump up and \nthrough. His jump up and through can be 1-2 steps late and leads him to leaning away from the ball and lacking full range \nfor his legs to access the ground inside the boundary. He can only get one foot inbounds and he resorts to underhand attack \nwhen overhand attack is much better here. He made one play in six games where it counted for the college game but \nwouldn’t have counted in the pros.  \nFocus: Collins maintains possession with tight coverage at his back and wrapping and prying at his arms and frame.  \nTransitions: Collins obeys the ball when determining the path of his catch-and-pierce transition. There are plays where he \noverthinks the position of coverage and tries for the reversal of field or cutback because he saw a safety 5-7 yards away to \nthe front side. He should use his size and take on that defender rather than cutback into backside pursuit he can’t see.  \nElusiveness: Collins spins off contact to his frame. He only needs two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter \nrunway. He lacks notable short area quickness or dynamic movements. His jump cuts have a small range and aren’t \nexplosive.  \n\n \n267 \nVision: Collins runs to open space. He also presses unblocked defenders into lanes where he can cutback behind a blocker \nand earn an open rushing lane. He’ll split defenders when necessary, too.  \nHe can overthink what he sees in an attempt to generate a big play – see Transitions.  \nPower: Collins has good range and placement with his stiff arm. He can knock defensive backs to the ground and set up a \nspin away from them.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Collins stalemates direct collisions with safeties in the open field and works to fall forward \nthrough them. He runs through cornerbacks who hit him head-on.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Collins bounces off shots to his side from defensive backs.  \nBall Security: Collins carries the ball away from his chest and side in the open field. When in traffic, Collins carries the ball \nhigh and tight to his frame and under the boundary-side arm. He can also take contact to the ballcarrying arm.  \nBlocking: When executing Man Over Me assignments, Collins earns a square and squat stance. He shuffles feet with a wide \nstance to remain square to the opponent.  \nCollins can take the air out of his interaction with the assignment, work his hands into the chest plate, and move his feet. \nCollins can deliver a punch with the roll of the hips. He latches on well against defensive backs and he can be a bully against \nthem.  \nCollins will run off a defender, tilt into the opponent, and turn the defender away from the path to the ball carrier.  \nWhen handling Most Dangerous Man assignments, Collins is patient with his approach so he doesn’t engage too early in the \nplay’s development. He’ll square a safety. He turns sideways and gives up his leverage against linebackers.  \nCollins runs off defenders and plays out back-shoulder fade leaps to keep the defender’s back downhill during a running \nplay.  \nDurability: Collins suffered a torn plantar fascia at the end of 2023 which cost him the end of the season. He missed a \ngame with a separated left shoulder in 2022. He missed some of fall camp in 2022 with a sprained AC joint. He’s had some \ngroin and hamstring injuries but didn’t cost him time.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Collins from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFlat Speed Out, One-Handed behind Break Path, Pullback, Embrace Fall, Boundary \n• \nImproved Release, Full-Speed Stem, Long Break Step, Three-Step Break, Works Back to Ball \n• \nLapses with Underhand Attack \n• \nBeaux Collins 2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n268",
        "analysis": "Beaux Collins is a wide receiver prospect with a mixed profile.  His strengths lie in his solid release package, showing proficiency in various techniques to beat press coverage (double swat, blade release, two-quick, stutter, etc.), and adequate route-running skills, particularly in zone coverages.  He possesses good hands and can make contested catches, including one-handed grabs and those at his back shoulder. His size (6'3\", 202 lbs) is a significant asset.  He also displays decent blocking ability, especially in man-over-me situations.\n\nHowever, Collins has several weaknesses that limit his potential. His route running needs significant improvement, particularly in his breaks where he lacks explosiveness, precision, and weight transfer. He struggles with positioning himself optimally for the catch, often giving away his size advantage.  His ball-attacking technique is inconsistent, sometimes resorting to ineffective clap-attacks.  Furthermore, he's not a particularly elusive runner after the catch.  He also has a concerning injury history, including a torn plantar fascia and shoulder issues.\n\nNFL Player Comparisons range from Tee Higgins and Mike Williams, suggesting a potential for a possession receiver role, but his inconsistent play and lack of explosiveness suggest he may not reach that ceiling.  More realistically, he projects as a fourth or fifth receiver or a short-term injury replacement, unless he significantly improves his route running and overall consistency.  His ceiling is limited by his lack of explosiveness and refinement, while his floor is determined by his solid technique in some areas and willingness to block.  He needs to address his weaknesses to avoid becoming just a career reserve.\n"

Sheppard is on the cusp of \nContributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nAuburn ‘23 \n• \nFlorida ‘23 \n• \nUCF ‘24 \n• \nKansas State ‘24 \n• \nArizona ‘24 \n• \nUtah ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Sheppard could help an NFL team as a zone receiver early in his career if he can add more nuance to \nhis setups of coverage during his stems. If Sheppard improves the precision and sharpness of his breaks, he has the \nburgeoning skills at the catchpoint to have value as a flanker or slot-flanker hybrid who can win matchups against man \ncoverage.  \n \nAt his core, Sheppard is a possession receiver with the height to become a back-shoulder or boundary-route winner. He \nmust refine his attacks so he’s using the correct one for the trajectory of targets.  \n \nAlthough he’s not an elite athlete with the ball in his hands, Sheppard translates the footwork he uses as a route runner to \nthe open field as a ball carrier. He will get yards after the catch using his size, footwork, and vision to exploit holes in zone \nor routes where he’s breaking across the field.  \n \nIt would be surprise if Sheppard becomes an NFL starter, but he could eventually contribute in four-receiver sets.  \n \nReleases: Sheppard uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \nAt Vanderbilt, Sheppard sinks into his stance, rocks off the back foot, and rolls off the front leg with his pads over his knees \nand head up. His arms pump at half the capacity of his range of motion coming off the line.  \nAt Colorado, Sheppard has curtailed some of the rocking off the back foot before rolling off the front foot.  \nHe must work on sustaining the pads over the knees for a longer period of the stem to sell the vertical potential of the route \nor defenders playing off-coverage won’t have a reason to move off their spots.  \nSheppard uses a diamond release with a read step and a double up of his outside foot to attack outside leverage and set up \nthe break on a slant.  \nSheppard steals a release with a two-quick but it lacks artistry of patience and suddenness. He combines a pair of two-\nquicks to release inside against outside shade coverage at the line. He also combines a two-quick and a double up.  \nHe uses a read step and two-quick at the top of his stems on shallow speed outs. He combines a read step and a lean-in on \nskinny posts. He’ll also combine a read step and a shed against outside leverage at the line to work inside.  \nHis three-step release is effective. He has an effective hesitation release with a swat counter.  \nSheppard’s double up into the slant has patience and suddenness. He has an effective hip shift against man coverage and \nuses a good head fake to sell the move.  \nHe has a swat-swim counter to work outside the hands of a defender playing tight. He’ll also use the swat and a double \nswat as a singular counter. \n\n \n269 \nSheppard reduces his shoulder from a defender with inside leverage shooting his hands at the receiver.  \nSheppard has a patient read step paired with a sudden stick to the inside to set up an outside release.  \nSeparation: Sheppard has the speed and acceleration to win intermediate and vertical range routes (15-40 yards). He’ll \nmaintain separation against cornerbacks when he gets behind them and can break away from a lot of defensive backs in \nthis scenario. Only once in four games did I see him stack. He did it off a three-step release inside.  \nRoute Stems: Sheppard tips off his routes because he doesn’t sell the vertical potential of routes breaking back to the \nquarterback and the underneath defender has no reason to turn his hips and work downhill. Sheppard runs at the defender \nplaying off-coverage and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe.  \nHe’ll also widen stems against outside leverage. He’s effective of accelerating his pace at the top of the widening of the \nstem to influence the defensive back to turn his hips.  \nRoute Setups: Sheppard shows his eyes at the top of stems on in-breaking routes and executes some semblance of a \nstair-step. However, the stair-step doesn’t attack downfield long enough and that would help him sell a “peek” at the top of \nthe stem as if he might break outside on a fade or corner route.  \nHe has shown a better stair-step when the coverage his playing tighter to him, or when he’s running a corner route.  \nSheppard can peek outside and turn his frame to the boundary on a double move up the seam.  \nRoute Breaks: Sheppard gets his head around early and creates a friendly target when breaking on slant. He has a three \nquick break with a small amount of weight drop. The weight drop can be deeper so he can decelerate quicker. He doesn’t \nwork fast enough out of his break.  \nSheppard has flat speed breaks with tight drive steps and line steps. He can deliver snap with his turns on breaks inside. He \nhas a long break step into short hitches.  \nWhen breaking back to the quarterback he will slide away from the nearest zone defender to buy space.  \nZone Routes: Sheppard identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break across the zone. He \nturns his head after passing the rollover/buzz defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Sheppard is aware of the boundary and can keep his feet inbounds with his footwork.  \nPass Tracking: Sheppard can track the ball from inside shoulder to outside shoulder to make the high-point catch. He can \nalso extend wide of his frame, over his shoulder, and make a one-handed underhand scoop of the ball near the boundary \nand an out-route thrown high.  \nSheppard has lapses where he leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at his numbers or higher on routes breaking over \nthe middle.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Sheppard attacks targets with overhand position close to the numbers of his jersey. He high-points \neffectively near the boundary.  \nSheppard has lapses where he uses a clap-attack with his hands in side-by-side position and drops the ball.  \nSheppard digs out low throws where he must make a sliding catch.  \nPosition: Sheppard has an effective pull back and he embraces the fall when returning the ground. He times his jump up \nand through effectively against tight coverage but uses underhand position when leaping for the ball with the defender at \nhis back.  \nFocus: Sheppard high-points effective with a defender tight to his back and wrapping him at the chest as he retracts the \nball. He can take a hit to the chest when catching a hitch with underhand attack.  \nTransitions: Sheppard catches and pierces downhill.  \n\n \n270 \nElusiveness: Sheppard spins through contact so he can keep his feet moving downhill when wrapped high. He kicks his \nheels toward his backside to avoid low shots to his legs in the open field. He has sharp lateral cuts and dips against pursuit \nover the top. He has some curvilinear speed to bend around downhill pursuit.  \nSheppard also delivers effective footwork patterns like double ups to work away from contact. He has enough short-area \nquickness and can combine footwork with head and shoulder fakes to avoid pursuit in tight quarters over the top of them.  \nVision: Sheppard identifies the soft spots in traffic and attacks them as a runner. He’ll split defenders in zone coverage and \nmaximize his yardage potential in that scenario. He has awareness of the boundary and works to open space to avoid \ngetting knocked out of bounds.  \nPower: Sheppard keeps his feet moving through wraps to his torso and can pull defenders forward who have wrapped him \nhigh. He drops his pads into contact and forces defenders to wrap low. He pulls through reaches to his lower legs.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Sheppard stalemates direct contact from cornerbacks.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Sheppard bounces off glancing shots to his side and torso from cornerbacks in the open field. \nHe has an effective balance touch to work through contact to his legs.  \nBall Security: Sheppard carries the ball high to his chest. His elbow can be loose from his side.  \nBlocking: Sheppard earns as square and squat position, shuffles his feet with a wide base, and extends his arms for the \nchest of the opponent. He can do more to close the gap.  \nSheppard may not deliver the first punch but when he locks on with his hands tight, he can dominate a cornerback and \nmove the defender where Sheppard wants to go.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Sheppard from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nRead-Step/Double Up Combo on Slant, Spin, YAC \n• \nTips off Stem, Must Drop Weight with 3-Step Break \n• \nSwat/Swim, Tracking, High-Point, and Boundary \n• \nWidens Stem, Pace Change, High-point vs. Tight Coverage \n• \nDiving Catch, Tight Coverage, Embraces the Fall Deep Post \n• \nKicking heels through or way from contact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n271",
        "analysis": "Will Sheppard is a WR prospect with a blend of size and route-running skills, but needs refinement to reach his full potential.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:**  At 6'3\", 205 lbs, he possesses the size to win contested catches, especially on back-shoulder throws and boundary routes.  He demonstrates good high-pointing ability and can extend to make difficult catches.\n* **Route Running Fundamentals:** He displays a solid understanding of route concepts and shows proficiency in several release techniques (diamond, two-quick, three-step, hesitation).  He's effective at using his footwork to create separation, particularly on intermediate to vertical routes.\n* **YAC Ability:** Despite not being an elite athlete, he uses his size, footwork, and vision to gain yards after the catch (YAC), effectively navigating traffic and exploiting soft spots in zone coverage.\n* **Zone Awareness:** He shows awareness of zone defenders and effectively times his breaks to get open.\n* **Durability:**  No significant injury history is noted.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Stems and Setups:**  His biggest weakness is the inconsistency and predictability of his route stems. He often tips off his intentions, failing to sell the vertical potential of routes.  Improving the nuance and deception in his stems would significantly enhance his effectiveness.\n* **Route Breaks:** While he has some sharp breaks, he needs to improve the precision and sharpness of his breaks, particularly decelerating quicker and working faster out of his breaks.\n* **Ball Security:** His elbow can be loose, which presents a risk of fumbles.\n* **Blocking:** While he shows effort, he could improve his consistency and technique in blocking.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report compares him to Michael Clayton (a possession receiver) and Jauan Jennings (a possession receiver with some contested catch ability).  This highlights his potential as a possession receiver, but also suggests he may not be a high-volume, explosive playmaker.  He's projected as a reserve or limited-role starter, not a likely star.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR56 \nJersey No. 10/1 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/163 School: Colorado/FAU \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Wan’Dale Robinson – Ray-Ray McCloud - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 74.4 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nNebraska ‘24 \n• \nUCF ‘24 \n• \nKansas State ‘24 \n• \nArizona ‘24 \n• \nCincinnati ‘24 \n• \nUtah ‘24 \n \nReleases: Wester has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang straight at \neither side of his front leg. When he begins his release, he sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot.  \nWester is prone to rocking off his back foot as he sinks into his stance. He can release without the wasted motion, but he \ndoesn’t sink as deep when he cuts out the rocking. He must learn to generate the sink into his stance without the wasted \nmotion.  \nWester gets his pads over his knees and comes off the line with a sprinter’s gait. The arms move at three-quarter their full \nrange of motion.   \nWester uses a read step at the top of his short stems against off-coverage to attack outside leverage. He can counter a \ndefender’s hands with a wipe. \nHe uses a hesitation to work inside-out of off coverage and counters with a wipe. Wester can be patient but sudden when he \ncombines a patient hesitation with a sudden read step before countering with the wipe.  \nWester has a sudden two-quick with a head fake to the inside when releasing outside after a patient approach into the \nmove. He also can counter with a swat-swim.  \nWester has a violent stick at the top of his stem against off-coverage and counters with a shed. He uses a read step and a \ndouble-up to run a diamond release on a quick slant. Wester also uses a double up to steal a release on running plays.  \nHe reduces his shoulder from the reach of an off-coverage defender at the top of his stem. He also uses a hip shift at the \ntop of his stems against off-coverage.  \nWester can get knocked off his path easily as he’s working into his stem.  \nSeparation: Wester can earn separation against off-coverage safeties on vertical routes. Whether it was CU or FAU, \nWester’s role as a slot or inside trips receiver precludes him from most routes where stacking is a choice.  \nI watched him stack a defender once at FAU – on a seam route against Middle Tennessee State in 2023.  \nRoute Stems: Wester widens stems to set up outside leverage. He’ll take the back of the defender and attack the leverage \nat full speed.  \nRoute Setups: Wester will punctuate the top of a stem with a peek or small head fake to the boundary after widening his \nstem against off-coverage. Wester stair-steps out-breaking routes against off-coverage.  \nWester can deliver an inset during his stem to set up a break outside against a trailing defender.  \nRoute Breaks: Wester has a long break step but needs two transition steps to get into a flat drive step. With shallower \nspeed outs, his drive and line steps are flat and he runs out the break.  \n\n \n272 \nWester gets his head around early enough to look for the ball when breaking inside. He can snap his turns on speed outs. \nHe’ll also break back to the ball when breaking inside or outside.  \nWester has a quick drop and pop break within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. He generates a friendly target. There’s \nlimited weight drop into the break. He can deliver weight drop into a three-step break on an intermediate route, but the \ndrop can be deeper.  \nWester has an effective false acceleration break. \nHis whip routes are excellent because he’s sudden and flat with his decelerations and breaks. His weight drop is deep \nenough with these breaks.  \nZone Routes: Wester identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He creates a \nfriendly target. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to an open area. He can tempo his break between zone \ndefenders but can do a better job of settling earlier than he does.  \nRoute Boundary: Wester is aware of the boundary and can toe-tap off a high-point. Wester can catch out routes extending \ntoward the boundary and drag the feet.  \nPass Tracking: Wester leaves his feet unnecessarily on throws above his head and this wastes movement and time to get \ndownhill. Wester tracks the ball over his shoulder on vertical routes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Wester can overthink the position of his hands when attacking targets that take time to arrive and \nhave trajectory towards his frame. This can lead to him using an attack that isn’t uniform and he fights and drops the ball.  \nWester can win targets over his head with tight overhand position, but he’s prone to clap-attacking and allowing the target \nto go through his hands—especially when attacking the ball with a defender bearing down on him.  \nWester’s hands are too wide when attempting to dig out a low throw ahead of his break path. He also slap attacks targets at \nhis chest with side-by-side clapping on shallow targets.  \nHe doesn’t attack the ball at the earliest point when targets are arriving at his torso. This can limit his ability to win targets \nagainst tight coverage because defenders have access to the ball too soon.  \nPosition: When Wester’s hands are tight enough, he can dig out low targets when leaving his feet for the ball. He can also \nembrace the fall. Wester must develop a jump up and through when tracking underthrown or back-shoulder targets. He has \ntried to catch the ball over his shoulder while working toward the defender.  \nFocus: He can high-point and take a hard hit to his back. He can take wraps to his back while tracking the ball over his \nshoulder.  \nTransitions: Wester executes sudden transitions downhill. He doesn’t always obey the ball, but has knowledge of the \nbackside creases based on the play design and flips his hips fast enough to access those backside creases despite making \nthe catch toward the front side of the blocking scheme.  \nWhen he obeys the ball, he has the quickness to exploit rushing lanes in the red zone that lead to touchdowns.  \nElusiveness: Wester flips his hips quickly and this aids his change of direction in traffic and the ability to transition \ndownhill. Wester can transition downhill on a perimeter approach with two small and quick steps. He has good curvilinear \nspeed.  \nWester layers moves in succession to bait defenders into angles he can defeat.  \nVision: Wester is decisive through tight creases. He’s creative in the open field and knows how to bend across the field to \nearn quality gains in the open field.  \nWester is patient against unblocked defenders in the open field. He’ll layer moves to press a defender before cutting back \ninto the open space he generates with the press.  \nPower: Wester hits creases with low pad level and effective body lean. He can pull through reaches to his lower legs. \nWester uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame when working outside pursuit.  \n\n \n273 \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate a safety’s hit when he has momentum and the safety is flat-footed.  \nBall Security: Wester tucks the ball under his right arm even when working the left side of the field on a screen or RPO. He \ncarries the ball close to his chest. When he can anticipate oncoming contact, he secures the ball high on his chest and tucks \nthe elbow to his side. Otherwise, he’s carrying the ball loose enough that an accurate strike could dislodge it.  \nWhen he has the ball secure high and tight, he can take a shot to the ball-carrying arm and a rip attempt from a linebacker \nor defensive lineman.  \nBlocking: Wester earns a square and squat stance, shuffling his feet in a wide stance to approach stalk blocks on screens \nand RPOs. His arms are bent at the elbow when he meets a defensive back in a collision. He’s willing to throw multiple shots \ninto the chest of the defender with his hands tight.  \nWester closes the gap between himself and the defender. He is prone to slight overextension into the collision point and this \ngives opponents the advantage to use that off-balanced momentum against Wester and shed the block after the initial \ncontact. He’s also prone to overrunning his approach and giving a defender an opening to shoot a gap past Wester and \ndisrupt the ball carrier.  \nHe lacks the size to anchor when an opposing corner has earned downhill momentum into the collision. He doesn’t get run \nover, but he’s pushed backward.  \nWester can run off a cornerback, tilt into the opponent, and earn a square position with good hand placement and footwork \nto generate a push downfield.  \nOn quick-hitting perimeter plays to the short side, Wester will work inside and seal the linebacker’s outside shoulder long \nenough for the runner to get the edge. He moves his feet and earns good position with his hands on the defender’s \nshoulder.  \nWester earns good seals inside against safeties and shuffles his feet well to remain square to the defender.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Wester from afar unless he earns a return specialist job in the NFL and your \nleague awards points for returns.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nZone Work and Curvilinear Speed \n• \nDive, Stick, Crosses Face, Speed Out, and Obeys the Ball \n• \nHighlights \n• \n2024 Highlights  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n274",
        "analysis": "LaJohntay Wester is a slot receiver prospect with a diverse skillset but limitations that project him as a reserve contributor in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:** Wester displays a nuanced understanding of route concepts, utilizing various releases (staggered, read step, hesitation, two-quick, swat-swim, etc.) and breaks (drop and pop, false acceleration, whip routes). He's particularly effective at setting up defenders with stem variations and head fakes.  His zone route running is also a strength, as he identifies open areas and creates friendly targets.\n* **Elusiveness and Open-Field Running:**  He possesses excellent change-of-direction ability, quick hips, and curvilinear speed, allowing him to make defenders miss in traffic and create yards after the catch.  He displays patience and creativity in navigating the open field.\n* **Blocking:** While undersized, Wester shows willingness and effort as a blocker, particularly on screens and RPOs. He can earn good seals, especially against safeties.\n* **Ball Security:** When he anticipates contact, he secures the ball well.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improving Release Consistency:**  While proficient with several release techniques, he needs to eliminate wasted motion and consistently generate sink into his stance without rocking.\n* **Enhanced Catch Technique:** He needs to refine his hand placement and attack the ball more consistently, especially under pressure, to reduce drops and improve his ability to win contested catches.  Overthinking hand position is a significant issue.\n* **Route Tracking and Ball Tracking:** Occasional issues with leaving his feet unnecessarily on high throws and inconsistent ball tracking need improvement.\n* **Strength and Blocking:** Despite his effort, his size limits his ability to consistently anchor against bigger cornerbacks.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report lists Wan'Dale Robinson and Ray-Ray McCloud as comparison players.  This suggests a player who excels in the slot, possesses elusiveness after the catch, and is a willing blocker but might lack ideal size and consistent high-level production to be a featured receiver.  The comparison also hints at his potential role as a return specialist, given McCloud's history.  He is a smaller, quicker receiver likely to thrive in a specific role rather than as a true WR1.\n"

He plays inside when running anything else. He has big-play value as part of four- and five-\nreceiver sets and on special teams.  \n \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Tight hands at the catch point. He has lapses with clap-attacks and focus drops with \nwide hands.  \nReleases: Baldwin has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His hands rest uncrossed \nat either side of his front knee.  \nWhen Baldwin begins his release, he can deliver without wasted motion but he must sink into his stance. He has enough \nlapses where he rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front foot that he should address the issue.  \nBaldwin also has wasted movement where he takes an unnecessary step with his front foot before releasing from the line.  \nHe gets his pads over his knees and his arms pump at partial range of motion.  \nBaldwin has an effective read-step and wipe combo to attack inside leverage.  \nBaldwin uses a stick and swat combination to work past off-coverage playing outside leverage. He reduces his shoulder to \nwork past outside leverage.  \nHe uses a stick and shed combination against outside leverage when in the middle of the field and breaking inside-out. He \nalso uses a stick and shoulder reduction combination against the same leverage.  \nBaldwin uses a wipe counter at the top of vertical stems.  \nWhen running over routes, Baldwin has a two-quick during his stem to set up a break inside.  \nBaldwin uses a hesitation and follows up with a two-quick when working up the seam against outside leverage. He uses a \nhip shift to set up an over route. The hip shift needs more artistry. So does his double up.  \nHis double-up/trigger-step combo on screens has patience and suddenness.  \nSeparation: Baldwin can run past a cornerback and earn 2-3 steps on him when running a deep post against his outside \nleverage. He has enough acceleration to beat off-ball linebackers to the short corner and up the boundary.  \nHe’ll stack a linebacker on over routes.  \nRoute Stems: He’ll dive inside against inside leverage. He can also widen his stems, but must be more aggressive with \ndoing so.  \n\n \n275 \nRoute Setups: Baldwin has an inset at the top of stems where he’s diving against a defensive back playing over the top. \nHowever, he takes too long to get in and out of his break for the inset to do its job – especially when he’s breaking outside \nagainst outside leverage.  \nBaldwin is good at maintaining his line on a stem and running that stem until he works into the defender’s toes. As the \ndefender turns his hips, Baldwin takes the defender’s back.  \nHe sells the peek toward the fade on the deep post. He turns the head long enough to widen the nearest defender.  \nHe can stair-step an in-breaking route to keep the safety at depth after diving his stem inside toward the flat defender.  \nRoute Breaks: Baldwin doesn’t drop his weight into three-step breaks and his deceleration isn’t sudden enough to work \nback to the ball on time when running a curl or a comeback. He can come to a quick stop with a three-step break without \nweight drop when facing off-coverage but he must learn to maximize his separation.   \nHis intermediate breaks with three-step break technique result in 4-5 steps because he doesn’t drop his weight enough.  \nThere is weight drop with his drop and pop breaks. Baldwin creates a friendly target and gets his head to the quarterback. \nHis whip routes lack weight drop into the break.  \nOn shallow speed outs at half speed, Baldwin can deliver flat drive and line steps. He gets his head around and presents a \nfriendly target. When running intermediate speed outs, his drive step isn’t flat, but his line step is.  \nZone Routes: Baldwin identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break across the open zone, \nshowing his eyes when he passes the buzz/rollover defender. He must improve his awareness of the boundary and know \nwhen to settle and create a target. See below.  \nRoute Boundary: Baldwin must show greater boundary awareness, especially running zone routes. He has run himself out \nof a target when he should have settled as he got within steps of the sideline.  \nWhen breaking back to the boundary on a comeback during a sprint pass, he can drag both feet as he digs out a low throw \nwith full extension.  \nWhen running an out, he can toe-tap two feet in bounds while extending his arms for a low and away throw.  \nHe understands the concept that one knee equals two feet.  \nPass Tracking: Baldwin tracks over the shoulder with overhand and underhand position. He leaves his feet unnecessarily \nto catch targets over his head.  \nHands/Catch Radius: He uses underhand position for targets at his waist. His hands can get too wide to dig out low \nthrows. When he keeps them tight, he has success.  \nBaldwin can turn to his back hip as he’s breaking across the field and catch the ball with underhand position. He can high-\npoint the football.   \nWhen the target is arriving opposite his break path, Baldin has lapses with clap-attacks that lead to drops.  \nPosition: Baldwin will jump up and through to attack and underthrown target, but he uses underhand position. He must \nattack earlier and high-point. He will embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Baldwin can track and catch over his shoulder with tight coverage at his back. He can jump up and through on a \ndeep post and take a hit to the chest after making the catch. He’ll take hard shots to his back while securing the ball.  \nTransitions: Baldwin will catch and pierce downhill. He obeys the ball to determine the location of his turns.  \nElusiveness: He’s a stop-start type of runner who either uses stop-start to dramatically change direction or he makes small \ndips or violent sticks.  \nVision: He’s decisive and spots open space. He’ll bend against the grain to find open space and work underneath pursuit to \noutrun them. He’s patient to press and set up a block before getting downhill.  \n\n \n276 \nPower: He uses a stiff arm to run through reaches and deflect glancing shots. He can pull through wraps to his lower body \nand hips.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Baldwin will launch his pads into an oncoming cornerback when he has a runway. He’ll stalemate \nthe defender.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can take glancing shots – even a cross-body hit – from a safety coming downhill from the \ninside.  \nBall Security: Baldwin tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm after the catch. He carries the ball high to his frame, but \nswings the ball and his elbow is loose from his frame. \nBlocking: When executing Most Dangerous Man assignments, Baldwin closes the gap between himself and the defender. \nAnd gets his hands tight into the chest of the opponent. He can be guilty of dropping his head and overextending.  \nWith Man Over Me assignments, Baldwin is patient with his approach, closes the gap and gets a squat and square position \nto deliver his hands. Against defensive backs, Baldwin can roll through the hips when delivering the uppercut.  \nHe has effective tilt technique to run off the defender and then bend into the defender’s chest with tight position and wall-\noff the opponent.  \nDurability: Missed a game in 2022 with a head injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Baldwin from afar unless he earns a return specialist job and you’re in a league \nthat has scoring for returns.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSpeed and Tracking…Stem Needs Improvement \n• \nSpeed…Jump Up and Through and Stem Need Improvement \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n277",

His game is predicated on speed and elusiveness after the catch.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Speed and Acceleration:**  Baldwin possesses significant speed, allowing him to create separation deep and win on short-corner routes. He can outrun linebackers and create big plays.\n* **Elusiveness:**  He's a shifty runner with stop-start ability and effective use of jukes and stiff arms to break tackles.\n* **Big-Play Ability:**  His speed and ability to make defenders miss translate to substantial big-play potential, especially within a multiple-receiver set.\n* **Route Running (Specific aspects):**  He displays proficiency in certain route techniques, such as the read-step and wipe combo, stick and swat, and double-up/trigger-step on screens.  He's also adept at using the defender's momentum against them.  Good at stacking linebackers on over routes.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:** While capable in certain areas, his route running needs refinement.  Inconsistent weight transfer in breaks leads to missed opportunities for separation.  Improving his breaks, especially the three-step and whip routes, is crucial.\n* **Hand Consistency:**  Inconsistent hand placement and focus drops limit his reliability as a target. Developing tighter, more consistent hands will drastically improve his production.\n* **Boundary Awareness:**  He needs to improve his awareness of the sideline, particularly when running zone routes, to avoid running himself out of potential catches.\n* **Special Teams:** His speed suggests he could excel as a return specialist, offering a potential path to early NFL playing time.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Inconsistency:**  A common thread throughout the profile is inconsistency.  He shows flashes of brilliance but needs more consistent execution across various aspects of his game.\n* **Hand Strength/Focus Drops:** Tightening his hands at the catch point is a major area for improvement to reduce dropped passes.\n* **Route Running (General):**  While showing proficiency in some techniques, overall route running requires refinement for consistent separation.  This includes improving his inset technique and overall deceleration in breaks.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparisons (Anthony Schwartz, Jacob Cowing, and an unspecified \"X\") highlight the spectrum of Baldwin's potential.  Schwartz represents his raw speed and big-play potential, while Cowing might reflect his ability to contribute in the slot. The \"X\" suggests there's still a degree of uncertainty about his ultimate role.  Without knowing the \"X\" comparison, a more precise comparison is difficult, but he likely projects as a player who can contribute on special teams and as a rotational receiver based on his skillset.  He may struggle to earn a consistent starting role due to his inconsistencies.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR58 \nJersey: No. 83 / No. 25  \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/191 School: Virginia Tech/MTSU \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Mecole Hardman – Keke Coutee - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 73.8 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nVan ‘24 \n• \nMarshall ‘24 \n• \nODU ‘24 \n• \nMiami ‘24 \n• \nClemson ‘24 \n• \nUVA ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: If Lane had better work as a pass-catcher against tight coverage and contact, he could have been at \nan 80.8 overall. When taking this into consideration as well as him likely having draft capital, I’m doing an elevator pitch for \nLane.  \n \nWhy? Speed and likely usage. Lane is a lot like Mecole Hardman as a prospect. Both can flip the field as runners and deep \nthreats. Neither have been good at the catch point in traffic or against tight coverage.  \n \nTheir games short-circuit. They overthink how to attack the ball, and their existing technique is too lackluster to hold up \nagainst challenges for the ball.  \n \nAs you can see with Hardman’s career, offenses find a place for speed. Hardman has made a career as a space player who \nearns fly sweeps, end-around, RPOs, screens, crossing routes, over routes, and the occasional vertical shot off play-action.  \n \nThese are routes where Hardman’s speed and ball-carrying acumen are more important than route techniques and \nconcepts. These are routes where Lane wins.  \n \nBecause Lane wins with a limited menu of work as a big-play contributor, he’s most likely to help NFL teams with limited \ntarget volume, but see the field enough to stretch defenses to assist other routes.  \n \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Lane is used inside to match up with slower defender. He’s also motioned around the \ndefense to help the QB read coverage and match Lane with advantageous scenarios.  \nReleases: Lane has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side \nof his front leg. When he begins his release, Lane sinks into his stance and rolls off the front leg without wasted motion.  \nLane has a patient hesitation paired with a sudden two-quick. He has a shed counter against off-coverage playing inside \nshade.  \nLane has a hip shift on a crossing routes and vertical shots up the seam against off-coverage. He uses a violent stick at the \ntop of a stem on a seam route against off-coverage. He has a read-step he uses to steal a release at the top of a stem on a \nvertical-breaking route.  \nLane uses a blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed with the same arm – to work outside inside shade.  \nHe uses a double up at the top of stems against off-coverage to set up an intermediate in-breaking route.  \nSeparation: Lane has the speed to win in the intermediate and vertical game against safeties and nickel backs. He must \ndevelop more skills to beat corners on the outside. The athletic explosion is there, but the technique and conceptual \nknowledge of winning on the perimeter is limited. Most of the vertical routes he runs cross the face of the defender or angle \naway from the defender to the inside or outside.  \n\n \n278 \nRoute Stems: Lane will dive inside to set up an off-coverage safety. He’ll widen stems just enough and use a slower pace \nto set up a defender playing over the top before accelerating past.  \nLane will also run at a defender playing a deep cushion.  \nRoute Setups: Lane will and an inset with his dive to set up the off-coverage safety. He has a peek with a slight pace shift \nwith vertical stems against off-coverage, but the peek is rushed and only sold with his violent head fake. He must do more \nwith his stems, frame, and head to truly sell the move.  \nRoute Breaks: Lane’s speed breaks has lapses with flat drive and line steps. He drifts downfield. He has a flatter line step \nthat can compensate for the rounded drive step. He can break flat and break back to the quarterback with speed breaks.  \nHis intermediate in-breaking routes are most often rounded off.  \nLane’s whip routes have breaks where he’s running a shuttle drill more than dropping his weight into the break and that \nlimits his deceleration and balance.   \nZone Routes: Lane identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break into the open area. He waits \nto show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. He’ll throttle down to the open area.  \nWhen the first break doesn’t earn a target, Lane works to the open area. He also works with his quarterback on the \nscramble drill.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary as a runner and does good work to stay inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: Lane doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets arriving at helmet level. He tracks the ball over his \nshoulder with overhand position. He also tracks over the shoulder with underhand position away from his frame.  \nLane’s tracking short circuits in traffic and around tight coverage, especially in the deep passing game. He gets distracted \nand indecisive about how to attack or gauge his position to the ball. This results in dropped passes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lane can make underhand catches at his back hip and overhand catches just above his helmet. He \nalso tracks the ball away from his frame and behind his break path. He can track the ball at the knee behind his break path \nwith his arms extended.  \nLane can high-point. He also high-points high and behind his break path – even behind his frame with coverage closing on \nhim.  \nPosition: Lane can pullback a high-point and embrace the fall.  \nFocus: He can take a hit to his chest while high-pointing a back-shoulder throw against the path of his break – unplanned. \nStill, he’s often distracted and drops a fair number of  targets against tight coverage and contact.  \nTransitions: Lane can catch and pierce and obey the ball’s trajectory to dictate his turn downhill.  \nElusiveness: Lane has economical dips in tight space to make a defender miss who has a pursuit angle over the top. Lane \nhas sharp lateral movement. He has a tight spin. He’ll also spin through a wrap to at least extend forward.  \nLane can transition from the wide-side perimeter to a downhill path with 1-2 small steps. He has excellent stop-start \nmovement with this deceleration-re-acceleration.  \nLane has a good hip-shift in the open field to set up the force defender.  \nVision: Lane is decisive in traffic and has a downhill mentality. He identifies blocks and unblocked defenders. He’s a patient \nrunner with lead blocks. He’ll press one side of the block to set up the other.  \nPower: Lane can pull through lower-leg reaches. He has a capable stiff-arm to ward off reaches. Lane will drop his pads to \nsplit defenders downhill. He keeps his feet moving through wraps to his upper body.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate a safety in a head-on collision.  \n\n \n279 \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a glancing shot to his hips from an off-ball linebacker in the open field \nworking east-west to the flat.  \nBall Security: Lane tucks the ball tight to his chest. He uses the boundary-side arm, but he has lapses where he doesn’t do \nso at the boundary of a designed play. These are small exceptions.  \nHe can take a shot to his ball-carrying arm and maintain possession.  \nBlocking: Lane earns a square and squat position with Most Dangerous Man Assignments. He keeps his hands tight and \nearns a tight position to the defender. Lane overextends into contact and can lean with his head.  \nLane can handle hard contact from Man Over Me assignments that deliver the first shot. He must keep his hands tight, but \nhe can anchor much of the contact. He also doesn’t overextend against this type of assignment. He delivers an uppercut \nmotion with his hands but doesn’t roll through the hips or deliver a hard strike.  \nWith Most Dangerous Man assignments, Lane will work deep into the secondary for the safety and earn a flat lead to square \noff the defender.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: For fantasy GMs, Lane could have weekly value if their leagues also account for special \nteams yardage. Otherwise, he’s a boom-bust producer where you hope to discover the matchup values where you can \naccurately exploit his value on good weeks. It means he’s better as a temporary addition from your free agent pool. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nOpen-Field Prowess \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n280 \nWR Jimmy Horn, Jr. RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR59 \nJersey No. 5 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/174 School: Colorado / USF  \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Calvin Austin III – Tyler Scott/Jalin Hyatt – Charlie Jones – Anthony Gould - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 73.8 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nECU ‘22 \n• \nCincinnati ‘24 \n• \nUSC ‘23 \n• \nUCLA ‘23 \n \nReleases: Horn has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hand rest at either side of \nhis front knee. When he begins his release, Horn sinks into his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted movement.  \nHorn’s arms move at half the range of their full capacity for motion. His pads come over his knees during his release.  \nHorn has a three-step release against off-coverage playing outside shade and works inside on the slant. He counters the \ndefender’s hands with a swat.  \nHorn uses a two-quick release to set up a whip route. He steals a release with the combo of a stutter and a hip shift against \nan off-coverage defender with shallow cushion.  \nHorn uses a stick at the top of his stems. He’ll avoid inside leverage with shoulder reductions.  \nAgainst off-coverage, Horn will combine a trigger step and a two-quick. He has good variation with his stride length with \ndouble ups. He uses a shed against inside leverage playing off him.  \nNone of his moves have a contrast between patience and suddenness embedded into the plan and it makes the movements \npredictable and less compelling. He leans toward suddenness without patience/pacing variation that we see sometimes with \nhis stems.  \nSeparation: Horn has enough speed to beat safeties and most corners up the boundary in the open field. He will stack \ndefenders on seam routes.  \nRoute Stems: Horn runs at off-coverage defensive backs to the top of his stem and can influence them to turn their hips in \nthe opposite direction of his break.  \nThe length of Horn’s stem work with dives or running at the defender playing off his good enough to serve as a route set up \nfor a break in either direction of the defender.  \nRoute Setups: Horn manipulates pacing effectively with shallow routes. He has shown the ability to stair-step routes but \nmust emphasize the changes of direction for longer periods of each phase of the stair-step.  \nWith vertical routes, Horn can give a slight nod of the head at the top of the stem, but it’s not enough to bait many \ndefensive backs.  \nRoute Breaks: Horn has a smooth speed break on shallow out-cuts, delivering flat drive and line steps. When breaking on \nvertical routes like posts, he’ll adjust his break to work away from the coverage over the top and gain more width with his \nbreak so the quarterback can lead Horn to open grass.  \nHorn must deliver weight drop into his whip routes. Horn has long break step into a quick three-step break, but he doesn’t \naccelerate into the break, the break step can be longer and have more violence, and there’s little weight drop into the \nthree-quick break. There’s more weight drop and a longer break step with his three-step breaks from 2022 tape, but still \nnot adequate.  \nHorn has a long break step into a shallow drop and pop break with weight drop. We must see if he can do this effectively \nwith intermediate routes.  \n\n \n281 \nZone Routes: For shallow one routes, Horn identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open \narea. He presents a friendly target to the quarterback and gets his head around early in his break.  \nWhen running routes breaking behind zone defenders, Horns waits to show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed \nthe buzz/rollover defender. He tempos the breaks of these routes to sustain the length of time he’s in an open zone for his \nquarterback. \nRoute Boundary: Horn toe-taps just inside the boundary as he’s catching out-breaking routes. Horn can drag his foot after \nairborne against tight coverage as he tracks the ball over his shoulder near the end line.  \nPass Tracking: Horn tracks the ball over his inside shoulder. He can extend his arms fully to the ball high and away from \nhis frame. He extends first for the ball with his arms before leaving his feet. He can uses overhand or underhand attack to \nwin targets over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: He catches targets at his numbers with overhand position.  \nHorn has lapses with underhand attack when targets arrive behind his break path and he clap-attacks the ball. Even when \nhe makes catches with underhand position at the beltline and extends his arms, he’s prone to a slight clap onto the ball.  \nHorn has catches with tighter position and no clapping, but they are more the exception than the rule. Horn will dig out low \nthrows below his knees  with a tight underhand attack.  \nPosition: Horn will embrace the fall when digging out or extending for a throw low and away from his frame. Horn must \navoid fading downfield with his frame when working under a safety who is coming downhill to attack a target that Horn has \nposition to catch. He has allowed defenders access to his hands because of the fading position. Horn has a pull back when \ncatching over his shoulder against tight coverage.  \nFocus: Horn can high-point at the boundary on a vertical route and take a hit to his knees and shins. He can take a hit to \nthe back of his legs as he catches the ball. He can track targets over his shoulder against tight coverage at his back.  \nHe has difficulties with hard shots to the side. He can work over the middle and extend for a target where he takes a \nglancing shot to the chest. He as difficulty turning away from his break path and catching a target with or without contact \narriving.  \nTransitions: Horn catches and pierces. He also obeys the direction of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Horn adjusts stride length and pace to set up blocks. He has a tight and sudden spin through contact. He’s a \nquick stop-start mover as a route runner and ball carrier. Horn only needs two quick steps to transition from a perimeter \nrunway to a downhill runway.  \nVision: Horn is a patient runner who sets up open space with presses towards blocked defenders. He’s decisive into the \ncrease when it’s time to finish the press. He does this well with perimeter runs and downhill runs after the catch.  \nHorn identifies good opportunities to reverse field and earn better gains than he would earn with the original blocking \nscheme of the play. He must be careful not to take some of these risks in the black zone (backed up inside his own 20) \nwhen the risks outweigh the rewards.  \nHis creativity is good. His situational management of those choices can be better.  \nPower: Horn uses a stiff arm to swat away reaches to his frame. He keeps his feet moving through contact to his pads and \ngenerates a productive lean when wrapped.  \nHorn’s stiff-arm and footwork are good enough for him to pull through multiple reaches to his frame and legs during a run.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Horn wins collisions with cornerbacks delivering hits to his chest and shoulder. Horn will run \nthrough the hit and force the defender to his back. Horn may not shake the ensuing wrap attempt, but he moves forward \nand earns extra yards, which can mean the difference with converting a play at the sticks.  \nWhen Horn has momentum downhill, he bounces off hits to his side and hips from edge defenders—including defensive \nends.   \n\n \n282 \nBall Security: Horn tucks the ball high to his chest. He uses his right arm even when catching at target outside the \nnumbers near the left boundary on an RPO and all the pursuit is to his right. He can use his left arm in these situations, but \nthe lapses he has are equal to the amount of the time he does it right. Horn doesn’t switch the ball to his boundary-side \narm when reversing field.  \nBlocking: As a lead blocker on an RPO, Horn earns a square and squat position within range of his assignment and allows \nthe defender to approach the rest of the way so Horn has space to adjust. Horn delivers an uppercut strike and rolls through \nhis hips to generate force.  \nWhen Horn doesn’t punch, he’s a one-and-done blocker who allows defenders into rushing lanes way too early. This is not \nthe norm for his efforts.  \nHorn’s hands are tight enough to work into the chest of the defender. He is prone to overextending into the contact—\nleaning forward with his pads—and this can give a defender time to work around part of the strike and leave Horn a half to \na whole step behind the pace of the interaction. He’s often quick enough to adjust and tie up the defender based on his \nfootwork, strike, and original position.  \nWhen taking on Most Dangerous Man assignments, Horn squares the opponent, earning a flat lead to the inside man. He \ndelivers a hard strike that rocks the defensive back and gives Horn enough time to set his stance and sustain the effort.  \nIf that Most Dangerous Man assignment is a linebacker, Horn will square the opponent until it is time to strike. He doesn’t \nuse an uppercut with linebackers or larger defenders. Instead, Horn delivers his shoulder and it’s a one-off strike with little \nchance of maintain position to follow up.  \nDurability: Lower-leg injury in November of 2024 that cost him two games. According to his quarterback, Horn has played \nthrough multiple injuries in 2024. Missed one game in 2022.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Horn from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n \n• \nFull College Career Highlights \n• \n2024 Colorado Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n283",
        "analysis": "## Jaylin Lane (WR)\n\n**Strengths:** Exceptional speed, capable ball carrier, excels in space.  Wins on routes where speed and elusiveness are paramount (fly sweeps, end-arounds, RPOs, screens, crossing routes, over routes).  Good route releases and varied techniques to beat off-coverage.  Decisive runner with good vision and balance after the catch, capable of breaking tackles.  Good at tracking the ball at helmet level.\n\n**Opportunities:**  Needs significant improvement in catching the ball in tight coverage and contact.  Route running technique needs refinement, particularly in breaking and creating separation against press coverage.  His pass-catching ability limits his overall effectiveness.  Must improve his ability to sell route fakes and stems.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Mecole Hardman (primary comparison), Keke Coutee.  Lane's speed and play style are similar to Hardman, but his catching inconsistencies are a major concern.  Coutee represents a potential lower outcome if he doesn't develop his route running and catching.\n\n## Jimmy Horn Jr. (WR)\n\n**Strengths:**  Good speed, able to stack defenders on vertical routes.  Effective at manipulating pacing on shallow routes.  Smooth speed breaks on short routes.  Excellent ball tracking, especially over his shoulder.  Decisive runner with good vision and ability to create yards after the catch.  Effective stiff arm and ability to break tackles.  Good lead blocker with solid technique.\n\n**Opportunities:**  Route running needs significant improvement; lacks patience and variation in his releases and stems, making him predictable.  Inconsistent catching technique, particularly with underhand catches and in contact.  Prone to fading downfield, giving defenders access to his hands.  Needs to improve his weight transfer in breaks and develop more power in his strikes as a blocker.  Injury history is a concern.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Calvin Austin III (primary comparison), Tyler Scott, Jalin Hyatt, Charlie Jones, Anthony Gould. Horn's size and speed are reminiscent of Austin III and Scott, but his consistency issues are similar to those of the others listed.  He might have a similar trajectory as the other players listed—high potential but also significant risks due to inconsistency and injury concerns.\n"

The arms rest at either \nside of his front knee.  \nBanks sinks into his stance to begin his release. He rolls off the front foot and there’s no wasted motion off the back foot.  \nBanks’ pads don’t come over his knees as far as they should and his arms move at half the capacity of their range of \nmotion.  \nBanks has a read step he uses to attack outside leverage to set up an inside release. He’ll counter the defender’s hands with \na shed, but he must cultivate more violence. He uses a double up or two-quick to attack inside leverage and counters the \ndefender’s hands with a double swat.  \nHe counters the defender’s hands with a swim or a wipe. He uses a hesitation to set up a two-quick and counter with a \nwipe.  \nBanks steals a release with a hesitation off the line.  \nWhen facing defenders who square Banks with little or no cushion off the line, Banks must develop more artistry with his \nfootwork. There’s not enough range of motion or playing with pace to move the defender off his spot and it means Banks’ \nhand counters will not have any impact.  \nBanks has too many reps where defenders in the press position win the interaction because Banks can’t clear the defender’s \nhands with his counters.  \nHis best move that sets up a defender where Banks can counter effectively is his stick. He counters the defender’s hands \nwith a double swat. His hesitation and two-quick combo has patience and suddenness. He counters the defender with a \nwipe.  \nBanks’ wipe against off-coverage at the top of the steam on a fade is violent. He reduces his shoulder from outside \nleverage. He has a capable swat-swim.  \nSeparation: The work I saw downfield where Banks earned separation was against zone coverage.  \nRoute Stems: Banks dives stems inside for routes breaking over the middle. He widens stems against outside leverage and \nruns at the defender to set up vertical routes, but can attack the stem at full speed.  \nRoute Setups: Banks has a stair step to set up in-breaking routes, but he must sell the vertical longer than he does for the \nconcept to be more effective. Banks also doesn’t sell the head fake to the boundary long enough at the top of the stem on \nan in-breaking route. If he held it longer, it could be an effective peek. Even the fake is too brief to be effective for a head \nfake.  \nRoute Breaks: Banks executes short speed outs with flat drive and line steps. He gets his head around to the quarterback \nout of his break and presents a friendly target with his frame. He will also work back toward the ball.  \n\n \n284 \nBanks has a three-step break, but he doesn’t droop his weight deep enough and his break step leading into the effort isn’t \nwide enough. He also doesn’t accelerate into the top of his stem.  \nBanks snaps his turns on speed breaks.  \nZone Routes: Banks identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Banks drags his feet near the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: When he gets behind a C2 corner on a fade and he’s facing the quarterback, Banks can leave unnecessarily \nfor a wide-open target arriving at his numbers – even when using underhand attack or attacking at the earliest point with \noverhand attack.  \nBanks makes late full-body extensions for the ball while tracking with overhand position over his shoulder on the fade. He \ncan make difficult catches in this respect.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Banks high-points the ball effectively. He also digs out low throws well near the boundary, making \nsliding catches. He uses the appropriate attack based on the height of the target.  \nHe’s prone to small clap-attacking targets when using overhand position.  \nPosition: Banks embraces the fall when digging out low throws or coming down from high-points. Banks can a step earlier \nwith jump up and through efforts so his leap is on time and doesn’t force him to reach behind his frame to attack the ball. \nThis exposes his chest to the defender and limits any attempt at a pullback that he could have performed if he leaped \nearlier.  \nFocus: Banks can high-point with a defender tight to his back and deliver a hit while Banks is airborne. He can take a hit to \nthe chest as he’s returning to the ground from a high-point. He can get ping-ponged off two defenders with one delivering \nhard contact to his side and maintain possession of the ball.  \nTransitions: Banks obeys the ball and catches and pierces with routes facing the quarterback.  \nElusiveness: Banks delivers a hard stick to set up movement away from pursuit. He can sidestep tight pursuit from over \nthe top. He steps over low shots.  \nVision: Banks can sidestep unanticipated shots immediately after the catch. He’s patient enough to set up a safety in the \nmiddle of the field with pace and step variations at the boundary. This changes the defender’s angle of pursuit and allows \nBanks to dip inside after his press.  \nPower: Banks has the strength to turn through the wrap of a cornerback to his torso and keep his feet moving. He’ll drop \nhis pads into contact and run through reaches. Banks can stiff-arm an off-ball linebacker in the flat and ward off reaches to \nhis frame. \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Banks can win collisions with cornerbacks delivering glancing shots to his pads or vice versa.  \nBall Security: Banks carries the ball close to his chest. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm. He uses the boundary-\nside arm to carry the ball. He has lost the ball with a hard hit to his chest, but it’s hard to fault him based on the intensity of \nthe hit. May need to keep watching.  \nBlocking: Banks works downhill to stalk Man Over Me assignments. He doesn’t approach with a square and squat stance. \nInstead he runs straight to the defender and overextends, leading with his head.  \nBanks closes the gap much better and with more patience with Most Dangerous Man assignments when he motions across \nthe formation before the snap and leads the running back into the B or C gap with a safety on the other side.  \nHis arms are tight to the chest of the defender and he has the size to drive the defender backward with his footwork. Once \nBanks earns a push, he will transition to a squat/wide stance. \nBanks gets square to linebackers inside and seals them there on perimeter runs.

        "analysis": "Jahmal Banks is a WR prospect with a high ceiling but inconsistencies in his game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Catch Radius:** Banks' 6'4\", 220-pound frame and excellent high-pointing ability make him a significant red-zone threat. He excels at digging out low throws and making difficult catches, even with tight coverage.  He shows good body control and can absorb contact while securing the ball.\n* **Power and Blocking:**  He possesses surprising strength, capable of winning physical battles against cornerbacks and linebackers. He shows promise as a run blocker, particularly in specific assignments where he can utilize his size and leverage effectively.  He can deliver powerful stiff arms and run through tackles.\n* **Route Running (Potential):** While needing refinement, he displays flashes of good route running, especially against zone coverage. His ability to identify and exploit weaknesses in zone schemes is promising.  He shows good vision after the catch to elude defenders.\n* **Intangibles:**  He demonstrates good focus and concentration, holding onto the ball even through significant contact.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Consistency:** His route running is inconsistent. He needs to improve his precision and selling of fakes, particularly on in-breaking routes.  Developing more artistry in his releases against press coverage is crucial.  He needs to improve his acceleration into stems.\n* **Release Techniques:** While having a variety of release moves, he needs to be more violent and effective against press coverage.  He too often loses these battles.\n* **Footwork and Agility:** Refining his footwork will improve his route running and ability to create separation. He needs to display a wider range of motion and better pace changes to consistently elude defenders.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** While showing flashes of effective blocking, his technique needs significant refinement for consistent success.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided (Michael Pittman Jr., Lawrence Cager, Sam Pinckney) suggests a player who could be a productive receiver, but with potential limitations.  Pittman represents his size and potential red-zone threat, while Cager and Pinckney highlight the potential inconsistency and need for further development to reach that potential.  His overall profile suggests a player who may become a solid role player, but may not reach elite status.  His need for improvement in route running and consistency of technique prevents him from reaching comparisons to higher-tier receivers.\n"

His hands hang ahead of his \nfront leg uncrossed.  \nOwens sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. His pads come over his knees. His head \nremains up with his eyes downfield. His arms move at 2/3 the range of motion he can move them.  \nHe uses a feet switch to release outside of man coverage at the line. He counters the defenders hands with a violent swat-\nswim at the top of his stem.  \nOwens has a violent one-step stretch, double up, stutter, or a two-quick to steal a release in the run game.  \nOwens uses a feet-switch to set up a stem on a quick slant. He counters the defender’s hands with a violent shed and \ncounters them again with a violent wipe.  \nOwens uses a pair of hesitations and a wipe counter to work the diamond release on a slant against tight coverage. The \nhesitations need more artistry – a contrast between patience and suddenness – with pacing to be effective.  \nHe delivers a violent shed counter off a double up to attack outside leverage.  \nHe has a three-quick with a wipe counter to work inside a defender.  \nOwens repeatedly gets knocked off his line from press defenders and it derails his route.  \nSeparation: Owens can earn 1-2 steps with the help of manipulation tactics with his stems, but he doesn’t win off straight \nspeed/acceleration. Defenders make up ground on him.  \nRoute Stems: Owens takes the back of the defender when given to him to set up breaks. He’ll widen stems against outside \nleverage. He’ll also run at the defender. He’s patient with his stems and will dive his stem long enough to turn a defender’s \nhips.  \nRoute Setups: Owens shows his head and eyes at the top of stems to set up breaks. He has some weight drop he uses to \nsell double moves against off coverage. He can learn to develop insets and peaks to tell more effective stories against \ncoverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Owens has a long break step into a drop and pop break that lacks weight drop. This makes separation \ndifficult in tight coverage and impacts his ability to win the football. He creates a friendly target to the quarterback.  \nIn 2024, Owens showed some weight drop off a break step on a hitch-and-go against off-coverage. He also improved his \nweight drop with his three-step break and works back to the quarterback.  \nOwens snaps his head around for the ball as he makes his break. He has a flat drive step and flat line step on shallow speed \nbreaks. His drive step remains flat with intermediate routes. The line step is also flat. There have been isolated out routes in \nthe intermediate range where the line step can be flatter, but he compensates with the next 1-2 steps.  \n\n \n287 \nZone Routes: Owens identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He snaps his \nturns when settling into the area and presents a friendly target.  \nHe tempos his breaks across zones.  \nRoute Boundary: Owens is aware of the boundary and can back his way toward the boundary and keep both feet inbounds \nor toe-tap as he’s breaking toward the sideline. \nPass Tracking: Owens attacks targets on slants at the earliest window. He tracks and high-points over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Owens extends his hands to the target with overhand position out of breaks back to the \nquarterback.  \nBecause Owens attacks targets at the earliest point and with fingertips-first attack, he can generate favorable second-\nchances for targets just out of his reach for a first-time clean catch. He can reach behind his break in bad weather and \ngenerate a second-chance opportunity that’s favorable.  \nOwens can dig out tipped targets that arrive low.  \nThere was an isolated clap-attack of a wide target that resulted in a drop against Utah in 2024, but it was the first I saw in \nfive games.  \nPosition: Owens will embrace the fall on targets arriving low and require him to dive forward. He can have difficulty \nembracing the fall when making a full extension for a target over his shoulder and falling forward – he last dropped target \nbecause of this. He displayed a pull-back in 2024 with a defender in his face as he catches the speed out.  \nFocus: Owens catches the ball in tight coverage and while taking contact to his back. He can take contact to his chest and \ncatch the ball.  \nTransitions: Owens catches and pierces downhill after catching the target facing the quarterback.   \nElusiveness: He’s a straight-line runner. He slips making turns inside or outside pursuit over the top of him. Other than \nsmall dips, adjustments to strid length, and spins through contact after he’s wrapped, there’s not much in Owens’ toolbox. \nVision: Owens runs to open space and knows where to work around favorable leverage of blockers.  \nPower: Owens keeps his feet moving through contact when wrapped high. He finishes with strong body lean to fall forward.  \nOwens runs through upper-body reaches. He has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Owens can collide head-on with a safety in the collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Owens can bounce off contact from defensive backs.  \nBall Security: Owens covers the ball with both arms when colliding with defenders downfield. He can withstand rips at the \nball and his ball-carrying arm. He uses the appropriate arm away from pursuit.  \nBlocking: Owens works into the defender’s frame with a squat and square position. He knows how to chop downward on \nthe reach of a defender and work his hands inside the chest plate. He moves his feet to drive the defender off his spot.  \nOwens is patient with his approach against off-coverage defenders, and he’ll eventually work his way into their frame.  \nOwens earns a flat lead inside against defensive backs on perimeter run plays. This helps him seal the inside. He can anchor \nagainst a linebacker based on his stance but he must deliver a tighter punch to make it happen or else the defender gets \npast quickly. When his hands are tight enough, he delivers enough of a punch to slow or stop a linebacker’s pursuit.  \nOwens will run off a defender, tilt into the opponent, and move him away from the ball carrier.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If Owens could transition to tight end he might prove worthy of a stash in 1.5 PPR formats \ndown the line. Right now, monitor Owens from afar.  \n\n \n288 \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFeet Switch, Shed, Stem, Wipe, Early-Window Attack on Slant \n• \nWorks into CB’s Back, Early-Window Attack, Fingertips, and Second Chance vs. Contact \n• \nGood Boundary Work, Jump Up and Through, and High-point, But No Pull Back \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n289 \nWR Theo Wease, Jr. RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR62 \nJersey No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 6’3”/200 School: Missouri/Oklahoma \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Mike Williams – - - Beaux Collins - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 71.9 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nBoston College ‘24 \n• \nVanderbilt ‘24 \n• \nAuburn ‘24 \n• \nOklahoma ‘24 \n• \nSouth Carolina ‘24 \n• \nMississippi State ‘24 \n \nReleases: Wease has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. When he comes off the line, \nWease rocks off his back foot before rolling off his front foot. He sinks into his stance before rocking off that back foot. He \nshould curtail the rocking.  \nHe releases off the line with pads over his knees and head up. His arms move at half of their complete range of motion. \nWease can be too upright with his stems when he’s not the primary target.  \nWease uses a read step to set up a release inside on shallow crossing routes. He’ll dive inside against off coverage to set up \na two-quick when stealing a release. He also uses a hesitation to steal a release.  \nWease uses a wipe counter to get outside a defender’s inside leverage off a read step. He has a blade release – shoulder \nreduction and shed-- to work inside outside leverage.  \nWease has a double up to set up a release inside outside leverage. He uses a read step to set up a shoulder reduction \ncounter to get inside outside shade.  \nHe’ll use a two-quick to work inside outside shade and counter the defender’s hands with a wipe and then a shed if \nnecessary. He can also use the shoulder reduction as the counter after his two-quick.  \nWease has a feet-switch that he uses to release outside inside shade. He has a swat counter as well as a swat-swim \ncombination. He has a sudden stick against off coverage.  \nSeparation: Wease can generate separation against man-to-man coverage in the intermediate and vertical ranges of the \nfield – routes inside of 30 yards.  \nRoute Stems: Wease takes the back of the defender to setup drop and pop breaks on hitches. He’ll widen an outside shade \ndefender with his stem. \nRoute Setups: Wease will run at defenders as well as take their backs at the top of stems to set up breaks back to the \nquarterback or in the vertical game.  \nRoute Breaks: Wease has a break step that can be longer and he should sink into breaks on short hitches with a better \nsale of the vertical potential of the stem.  \nHis drop and pop breaks have a long break step into weight drop. He finishes friendly and gets his head around to the \nquarterback from his break.  \nWease also has a long break step into a three-step break. He drops his weight effectively into the break.  \nWhen running speed breaks, Wease has a flat and tight drive step. He also delivers a flat line step as he gets his head \naround to the quarterback and runs away from the defender.  \nZone Routes: Wease identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area, making a friendly \ntarget for his quarterback. He doesn’t show his eyes until he passes the buzz or rollover defender.  \n\n \n290 \nWease must learn when to settle and when to continue moving when working with his quarterback.  \nRoute Boundary: He can toe-tap the boundary on a back-shoulder route.  \nPass Tracking: Wease leaves his feet unnecessarily to catch targets just above his helmet. He tracks the ball over his \nshoulder with overhand position on shallow routes – including catches with one hand high and away from his frame. \nWease must improve his tracking and timing so he can jump up and through earlier.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Wease attacks hitches with his hands away from his frame with overhand position when targets \narrive at the numbers. He can catch the ball at the earliest window or arrival.  \nWease can use underhand position at the numbers as well as extend his arms with underhand attack at knee height while \nbreaking on a slant.  \nWease traps the ball to his chest. He also clap-attacks targets with overhand position. The hands are tight but he still claps \nand loses the ball.  \nHe digs out low throws away from his frame.  \nPosition: Wease will turn away from the ball and embrace the fall after extending to his knees to catch a slant while \nwrapped.  \nFocus: Wease can catch the slant with tight coverage at his back and wrapping him. He catches the over route arriving at \nhis back leg below the knee and do it in stride while wrapped at the back.  \nTransitions: Wease catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: Wease has a tight spin to catch and pierce away from the defender over the top of him on hitches. He uses a \nstutter to freeze a defender in pursuit. He can transition downhill from an east-west track within two steps. Wease has an \nefficient and tight spin.  \nWease combines a hesitation with a lateral cut to set up unblocked defenders.  \nVision: Wease anticipates the position of defenders playing over him on routes and turns to the open area away from the \ndefender’s pursuit. He sets up blocks with patience.  \nPower: Wease leads with his pads into contact and runs through the reaches of cornerbacks. He has a stiff-arm that helps \nhim ward off wraps. He keeps his feet moving through contact. Wease can pull through multiple reaches during a run.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Wease can bounce off glancing shots from cornerbacks.  \nBall Security: Wease carries the ball high to his chest with his boundary-side arm. He’ll switch the ball to work away from \nthe nearest pursuit.  \nBlocking: He earns a squat position on Man Over Me blocks downfield. He aims for the chest of the defender with his hands \nand locks on tight enough that cornerbacks have difficulty dislodging.  \nWease earns position on Man Over Me assignments – working inside-out to seal defenders outside on runs to the boundary. \nHe shuffles his feet to slide laterally and keeps his feet moving after contact.  \nWease runs off defenders on running plays, but must work on his tilt technique to earn position and deliver a block.  \nDurability: Missed all but one game in 2021 with foot injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Wease from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n\n \n291",
        "analysis": "**Rashod Owens (WR)**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Owens possesses a strong release package with diverse counters (swat-swim, shed, wipe) effective against both man and zone coverage. He shows good route running technique, particularly in setting up breaks and working the boundary.  He's a willing blocker who shows understanding of angles and leverage.  He displays good ball tracking and high-pointing ability, along with the ability to secure contested catches, even making impressive second-chance opportunities. He exhibits decent power after the catch and maintains balance through contact.\n\n* **Opportunities:** Owens needs to improve his straight-line speed and acceleration to consistently create separation. His route breaks, particularly the lack of weight drop, hinder his ability to create separation in tight coverage. Refining his hesitations and pacing in his release will enhance their effectiveness.  Improving his ability to embrace the fall while extending for high throws will reduce drops.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** Alshon Jeffery – This comparison highlights Owens' size, strength, and ability to win contested catches.  However, Jeffery possessed superior athleticism.\n\n\n**Theo Wease Jr. (WR)**\n\n* **Strengths:** Wease excels at generating separation in the intermediate and vertical ranges against man coverage. He has a solid release package, including counters and diverse techniques.  He displays good route running fundamentals, including setting up breaks and using his body to create space. He's adept at making catches in tight coverage and shows a knack for high-pointing the ball.  He's also a willing blocker with good technique in man-over-man situations.  He shows good elusiveness with tight spins and stutter steps.\n\n* **Opportunities:** Wease needs to improve his consistency in creating separation, especially against zone coverages. He should refine his break steps to sell routes more effectively and improve his weight transfer.  His pass tracking needs improvement; he leaves his feet too early sometimes. He needs to work on securing the ball more consistently and avoid the \"clap-attack\" that leads to drops. His blocking needs further refinement in run blocking.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** Mike Williams/Beaux Collins – This comparison highlights Wease's size, ability to win contested catches, and strong performances in the intermediate to deep areas.  However, like Owens, he lacks the elite athleticism of Williams.  Collins represents a more realistic comparison in terms of skill set and NFL potential.\n"

        "player_name": "Tory Horton",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR63 \nJersey: No. 14 \nHeight/Weight: 6’2”/196 School: Colorado State/Nevada \n \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Van Jefferson \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 71.2 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nWashington State ‘23 \n• \nColorado ’23  \n• \nBoise State ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: I’m making an exception for Horton in terms of delivering elevator pitches for prospects with reserve \nscores. The reason is that Horton has enough baseline skills to easily progress into contributor territory, and I didn’t see any \nplays where I could judge his contact balance – and I looked well beyond the games tracked above.  \n \nHorton has sloppy breaks that, if he fixes them, will place him a tier higher. If he addresses his problematic technique as a \npass-catcher, Horton could climb to a Rotational Starter tier. If he has balance commensurate for his size, he could have a \nlow-end starter grade.  \n \nI suspect the attack issues will plague Horton throughout his career, but I expect Horton to refine his routes. Based on the \nmedia buzz Horton received last year, Horton may earn NFL draft capital that gives him limited playing time.  \n \nThat limited playing time also could give Horton opportunities and confidence to correct the sloppiness of his route running \nquickly. If the hands improve, too, he’ll be one of those exceptional cases who rise fast and deliver possession receiver \nvalue.  \n \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Horton’s hands begin tight enough to meet the ball with his fingertips, but he must \nwork on squaring his palms to the ball rather than having his palms facing each other. This hurts his game when a target \narrives away from the path he initially tracked and he has to move his hands to the ball. The end result with his palms \nfacing each other is a clap-attack and leads to misses.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Colorado State used Horton a lot on the right side of the formation as a flanker. They’ll also \nuse him as an inside receiver in 10 personnel and on either side of the field in that alignment.  \nReleases: Horton has a staggered stance with his hands in front of his chest uncrossed. He displays 80/20 weight \ndistribution favoring from the front foot. When he releases, he sinks lower than his stance, but rocks off the back foot with \nan extra step before rolling off the front foot.  \nHorton releases with his pads over his knees, head forward, and eyes up.  \nHorton will use a one-step stretch or two-quick at the line as release maneuvers. He must deliver the footwork with more \nplay with pacing to sell the maneuvers effectively. When he uses the two-quick to steal a release the movement is patient, \nbut sudden.  \nHorton uses a foot switch that’s sudden when setting up a release outside the defender at the line.  \nWhen he punches the one-step stretch with more patience and suddenness, he earns enough separation to challenge the \ndefender downhill. He’s almost in position to stack the defender and will make the attempt.  \nHorton will combine a one-step stretch with a stick at the top of a stem on a short slant. He’ll also use a double-up to set up \nthe stem as part of a diamond release where he counters the hands of the opponent with a wipe. He can deliver this with \nexcellent suddenness.  \nHe combines a stick with a shed when he faces outside shade coverage, attacking the leverage and then working inside.  \nHe will steal a release and set up a block with a three-quick. He’ll also use a pair of two-quicks.  \n\n \n292 \nHorton has a shed, but it’s not violent enough. He uses it more to block the reach of the defender and doesn’t deliver it with \na complete motion. \nHorton lacks a second-gear commensurate with an NFL starter. A linebacker can pull Holt out of bounds after Horton has \nworked across the field to the far-side flat and can’t turn up field fast enough to avoid the reach of the defender.  \nRoute Stems: Horton will widen his stem toward the defensive back’s leverage.  \nSeparation: Horton will use a shed to counter the hands of a defender playing press coverage.  \nHe cannot accelerate past cornerbacks playing at the line with inside-shade leverage when taking an outside release. His \nburst is not as good as his speed and he needs to win with maneuvers so he can earn space to reach his top speed. His \nspeed is better for long developing routes.   \nHorton can attack outside-shade coverage and run at the feet of the opponent long enough to enforce the defender’s \nposition.  \nRoute Setups: Horton will take the back of the defender, but he must attack that leverage harder to truly sell it and \nmaximize separation on breaks back to the quarterback or with vertical breaks like the post. When he uses an inset and/or \na peek with suddenness of movement, he can force the defender to turn his hips and overrun the route.  \nHe must keep his footing with double moves and the first step toward doing so is having a sharper plan to execute the \nfootwork.  \nRoute Breaks: When running curls, Horton has an elongated break step and follows with a three-step break. He doesn’t set \nup the break well enough to get the defender turn his hips at the top of the stem.  \nThere’s not enough snap with his break. He gets his head around fast enough to see a target coming. \nWhen dropping his weight to execute a break on a vertical target over 20 yards downfield, he must maintain his balance.  \nWhen executing a speed out, Horton has a sharp enough drive step, but the line step isn’t flat enough to avoid him drifting \nout of his break on and intermediate out patterns. It’s inconsistent with short patterns, but he has shown that he can get a \nflat break and work back to the ball. The snap is lacking.  \nHorton will work back to the quarterback on scramble drills.  \nZone Routes: Horton cans the field, identifies the second-level of the defense, and settles into the open area of the zone \nwith a friendly position to the quarterback. When working across the defense, Horton will slow down his break to maximize \nthe space in the open zone. He’ll wait to show his eyes to the quarterback until he has passed the buzz defender on shallow \nzone routes. \nRoute Boundary: Horton can tap one foot inbounds when high-pointing the ball. He must work on keeping his inside leg \nfrom kicking skyward while executing a pull-down to turn away from the defender after the high-point. This wastes \nmovement and makes it far more difficult for him to get a second foot inbounds.   \nHorton can drag a foot at the boundary, but must work on getting both inbounds. When he isn’t kicking the leg skyward, he \nget both feet in.  \nPass Tracking: Horton tracks the ball effectively and can turn his frame and extend his arms through the catch point when \nattempting to transition downhill immediately after the catch. He tracks the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage \nand a hand flashing past his face. \nHands/Catch Radius: Horton uses overhand position to catch chest-high targets on screens where his break faces the \nquarterback. He’ll use underhand position with targets at his waist.  \nHorton high-points the ball effectively and has the hand-eye coordination to attack the ball with his arms outstretched from \nhis frame when forced to catch a target wide of his frame or decides to wait until a late window so he can transition downhill \nas he’s making the catch.  \nHe catches crossing routes below waist height with underhand position and his arms away from his frame—even behind his \nframe at his back hip.  \n\n \n293 \nHorton has lapses where he lacks uniformity with attack and uses one high and low, allowing chest-high targets into his \nframe. He will use uniform overhand position for targets thrown behind his break path at shoulder height. \nHe’ll also allow targets into his frame that he could attack earlier with overhand position. If he has lapses with looking the \nball in when he does this, he can juggle or lose the ball. His underhand attack with tracking targets over his shoulder can be \ntoo wide and he fights targets he should earn. \nPosition: When high-pointing, Horton can turn away from the oncoming defender with an effective pull-down. He also has \nan effective jump up and through on deep crossers when attacking under-thrown targets. He can embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Horton can take contact to his back while catching a target over his shoulder with that coverage tight to his back. \nHe can high-point and win the target with defenders contacting his back and/or reaching between his arms for the ball.  \nTransitions: Horton catches and pierces downhill when executing WR screens. \nElusiveness: Horton is quick enough to dip inside a linebacker in the flat and turn up the field for additional yardage. \nHorton has an effective jump cut and follows up with a stiff-arm when the pursuit reaches for him. He’ll also pair the two to \naddress one defender. He has an effective stick-and-spin combination to avoid pursuit from the inside after transitioning \ninside and downhill of the corner.  \nHe drops his weight well into a stick-and-jump-cut combination. If his release footwork was as patient-but-sudden as his \nsticks as an open-field runner, he’d be a dangerous route runner. \nVision: Horton has good peripheral vision and can make two defenders miss in succession in tight quarters. He can press a \nlane and find a cutback.  \nPower: Horton drops his pads through tight creases. He’ll use as straight arm to ward off pursuit as he turns the corner. \nHorton will also drop his pads and get to the ground to avoid a defender pursuit hard over the top of him.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: N/A \nBall Security: Horton carries the ball high to his chest when in traffic. He uses the boundary-side arm to secure the ball \nand he’ll switch the ball to the appropriate arm. \nBlocking: Horton shuffles his feet with a should-width stance when stalk blocking. He works within two yards off his \nassignment. When he gets within range to throw his hands, Horton uses an uppercut motion with bent elbows. He doesn’t \nthrow or time his punch well enough to generate force. He aims for the chest and moves his feet after earning contact.  \nHe has lapses where is hands are too wide, he catches the defender, and hugs the opponent, drawing holding calls.  \nHorton will deliver a punch with Most Dangerous Man Assignments, leading with a forearm or his shoulder. He’ll also get a \nflat lead to square up the safety in these situations.  \nHorton has effective Tilt Technique to seal a defender outside at the top of his stem.  \nDurability: Horton missed most of the 2024 season with a knee injury. He got hurt in the second game of the year, \nreturned the following week, missed two more weeks after that, and then left the San Jose St. game in mid-October. \n \nHorton got surgery in October and was ready to run at the NFL Combine.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Horton from afar, but be prepared to stash on a summer dynasty roster that has \nexpanded spots if you hear praise specifically about his route running. If he’s also earning praise as a pass catcher, he may \nremain a candidate for an active roster spot.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n\n \n294",
        "analysis": "Tory Horton is a WR prospect with a high ceiling but significant inconsistencies.  His RSP ranking of WR63 reflects his current limitations, categorized as a \"Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.\"  However, the scout notes his potential for significant improvement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Speed:**  At 6'2\" and 196 lbs, Horton possesses good size for the position and combines it with solid speed, beneficial for longer developing routes.\n* **High-Pointing Ability:** He excels at high-pointing the ball, showcasing good hand-eye coordination and body control, even under tight coverage.\n* **Open-Field Running:**  Horton demonstrates elusiveness and vision after the catch, using effective moves like jump cuts and stiff arms to evade tacklers.

He utilizes a variety of release techniques and has the athleticism to execute them effectively with refinement.\n* **Zone Awareness:** Horton displays good awareness of zone coverage, finding open areas and settling into advantageous positions for the quarterback.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** His biggest opportunity lies in improving his route running technique.  Addressing the inconsistent breaks and sloppy execution would drastically elevate his game.\n* **Pass-Catching Technique:**  Improving his hand placement and attack on the ball would lead to fewer drops and more reliable catches.\n* **Contact Balance:**  Developing better contact balance would allow him to maintain his momentum and break tackles more effectively.  This is currently unknown but could drastically improve his value.\n* **Second Gear:** Improving his acceleration and ability to quickly change direction would make him more difficult to cover.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Inconsistent Route Running:**  Sloppy breaks and a lack of sharpness in his movements currently limit his separation.\n* **Pass-Catching Technique:**  His hand placement and attack on the ball are inconsistent, leading to drops.\n* **Lack of Second Gear:**  He struggles to quickly accelerate past defenders, particularly in short-area routes.\n* **Durability:**  He missed significant time in 2024 with a knee injury.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison: Van Jefferson**\n\nThis comparison suggests a player who has size and some athletic traits but needs to refine their technique to become a consistent contributor.  Jefferson's career trajectory could represent Horton's potential path.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nHorton is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His physical tools and flashes of potential are promising, but his inconsistent technique needs significant improvement.  His success in the NFL will hinge on his ability to refine his route running and pass-catching skills.  If he can do so, he could develop into a solid rotational player or even a low-end starter.\n"

His hands rest at either side \nof his front knee. There is a slight rock off the back foot as he sinks into his stance and before he rolls off the front foot. As \nhe runs more routes in a game, the rock goes away and there’s no wasted motion.  \nFleming sells the vertical potential of the route during his release. His arms pump and his pads are over his knees with his \nhead up. His arms could pump with a greater range of motion.  \nFleming uses a shoulder reduction, swim, or shed to counter the hands of outside shade coverage. He’s also prepared to use \nthe shed after the shoulder reduction (a blade release) when necessary. He uses a wipe to counter the hands of inside \nshade coverage and off a read step.  \nFleming has good violence with his wipe. Another combo that works for Fleming is a read step with a swat-swim counter to \nthe outside. He has a stick and wipe combo but there’s no artistry to it with pacing.  \nHe has an effective lean-in at the top of a short stem to deliver a quick in-breaker or slant against outside shade coverage.  \nFleming has a two-quick and a wipe counter when attacking off-coverage playing outside shade. There’s not artistry with \npatience and suddenness. The same is true with his hesitation and wipe counter. He will steal a release with it.  \nFleming will steal a release with a read step on his way to a Most Dangerous Man assignment inside against a safety.  \nFleming uses as feet-switch to get inside tight man coverage and the double-up to work outside on the corner fade in the \nend zone.  \nSeparation: Fleming has enough acceleration to attack the deep-third of the defense playing zone coverage.  \nRoute Stems: Fleming will dive his stems toward the inside shade leverage of the defender.  \nRoute Setups: Fleming will stair-step off-coverage defenders, but his stem movement and stair-stepping could have more \nartistry. His diving of the stem isn’t deep enough and he doesn’t play with pacing to sell the stair-step.  \nFleming delivers an effective inset against off-coverage on a double move. He also has a slight amount of weight drop as he \ndelivers it.  \nFleming can set up an out-breaking route with a stair-step that works into the feet and back of the defender playing off him.  \nRoute Breaks: Fleming has a drop and pop break into short hitches. He gets his head around to the quarterback with \nbreaks to the inside.  \nFleming has a three-step break into a curl route and breaks back to the quarterback. The break step isn’t long enough and \nit’s one reason that he doesn’t drop his weight deep enough.  \nHe uses a long break step on short in-breaking routes (five yards or less) against off coverage and delivers a speed turn \ninside with a sharp drive step and sharp line step. These speed turns are also effective when breaking at 10-25 yards. \n\n \n295 \nFleming uses snap turns on hitches in the run game, but must demonstrate snap with routes on passing plays.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Fleming works to an open area.  \nZone Routes: Fleming identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area while making a \nfriendly target. When working across a zone, Fleming tempos his break to maximize the open window between the triangle \nof zone defenders.  \nThere are some zone routes where Fleming continues tempoing the break where I think he should be settling against the \nzone triangle.  \nAt Penn State, Fleming learned when to show his eyes while crossing the zone – waiting until he pass the buzz/rollover \ndefender.  \nRoute Boundary: Fleming is aware of the boundary and toe-taps after the catch to get both feet in bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Fleming doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for the ball. He attacks targets with the appropriate technique \nand he displays late hands against tight coverage.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Fleming attacks targets at numbers height with overhand position and at the earliest point of \narrival. He can attack the ball high and behind his break path without a significant leap when it’s not necessary.  \nFleming can dig out the low throw while extending fully for it. When he has lapses with attack it’s clap-attacking targets with \noverhand or underhand position. He’ll also change his mind last second with the type of attack to use.  \nPosition: Fleming embraces the fall near the boundary on low targets below his knees where he extends fully to dig out the \nball.  \nFocus: Fleming will extend for the ball over his head while crossing the middle of the field and there’s an oncoming \nlinebacker working toward him. He’ll take an arm to his torso as he catches the ball. \nTransitions: Fleming uses catch and pierce principles, but he could benefit more from turning inside and splitting multiple \ndefenders rather than trying to take a wide path to the boundary against one.  \nHe lacks a sudden acceleration from a static position.  \nElusiveness: He can make stop-start moves and sidestep defenders, but it’s an effort for him to re-accelerate.  \nVision: Fleming runs to open space and he can set up unblocked defenders with one move. He manages game situations. \nPower: Fleming uses his stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He’s strong enough to pull defenders wrapped at his \nwaist and legs for extra yardage or at least a lean forward.  \nFleming pulls through reaches to his frame from linebackers.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: N/A \nBall Security: Fleming carries the ball high to his chest. His elbow is loose from his side. He uses his boundary-side arm. \nHe has lost the ball when a defender has chopped it – even with it against his numbers.  \nBlocking: Fleming is an excellent stalk blocker. He works inside to cut off his outside-shader corner and meets the defender \nwith a squat and square stance.  \nHe closes the gap well enough to deliver an uppercut punch with tight hands aiming for the chest. When he makes contact, \nhe rolls through the hips. He moves his feet after contact to generate a push or turn of the opponent.  \nFleming sustains stalk blocks against cornerbacks. His hands and position are strong.  \nFleming can lack patience with his approach of safeties on Most Dangerous Man assignments and he over pursues his \ntarget.  \n\n \n296 \nDurability: Chronic shoulder issues with multiple dislocations. Fleming had surgery after freshman year on left shoulder. \nThen another in sophomore year on right shoulder. Fleming calls his shoulders “bionic” after these labrum surgeries. These \ntears forced him to stop playing baseball.  \n \nFleming has had knee and ankle injuries and he missed seven games in two years. At Penn State, Fleming told the press in \n2024 that he’s as healthy as he can be.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Fleming from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStalk block \n• \nStems, Sheds, Tempos, High-Points, Takes Contact \n• \nStair-Step, Works into Feet, Speed Turn, Full Extension, and Embraces Fall \n• \nBack-Shoulder Wheel, Jump-Up-and-Through, Underhand, Pullback, Boundary \n• \nClap-Attack Lapses \n• \nClap-Attack But Fights Through It vs. Tight Coverage and Good Tracking \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n297",
        "analysis": "Julian Fleming is a WR prospect with a diverse skillset but some inconsistencies.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Route Running:** Possesses a solid foundation in route running, showcasing various release techniques (shoulder reduction, swim, wipe, read step) to beat press coverage.  He's effective at setting up defenders with stair-steps and in-sets, and shows proficiency in breaking on short and intermediate routes.  His zone awareness is noteworthy, as he identifies open areas and creates separation within zone coverages.\n* **Hands/Catching:** Secure hands, capable of high-pointing the ball and making contested catches. Shows good body control and doesn't often leave his feet unnecessarily.  He demonstrates an ability to extend and dig out low throws.\n* **Blocking:**  Excels as a stalk blocker, displaying strong technique, hand placement, and the ability to sustain blocks against cornerbacks.\n* **Physicality:**  Utilizes stiff arms effectively to break tackles and demonstrates surprising power for his size in pulling defenders.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Consistency:**  While possessing the tools, Fleming's technique and execution aren't always consistent.  His route running could benefit from more artistry and pacing, and his hands occasionally exhibit lapses in attacking the ball.\n* **Acceleration:** Lacks sudden acceleration from a standstill, which limits his explosiveness off the line and after the catch.  Improving his quickness will significantly elevate his game.\n* **After-the-Catch:**  While powerful, his elusiveness could use improvement. His transitions after the catch could benefit from more decisive cuts and inside running rather than relying on boundary routes.\n* **Durability:**  A significant concern; a history of shoulder, knee, and ankle injuries raises questions about his long-term availability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report mentions **Brandon Aiyuk** and **Jalen Coker** as comparison points.  This suggests a player with a blend of route-running ability (Aiyuk) and potential for physicality (Coker), but with a lower ceiling due to consistency issues and durability concerns.  He projects as more of a possession receiver who excels on intermediate routes rather than a deep threat. The comparison is more towards a mid-round potential with considerable risk due to injury history.\n"

His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \nDeGennaro releases from the line with his pads over his front knee and rolling off the front foot. When he’s blocking, \nDeGennaro rocks off his back foot. When he’s running a route where he expects to be the early read, DeGennaro sinks into \nhis stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. His arms move at about one-third to one-half their full range of \nmotion.  \nDeGennaro uses a two-quick release to threaten inside leverage before releasing outside. He reduces the shoulder as a \ncounter to the defender’s hands but can reduce more than he does. He also has a blade release – a shoulder reduction and \nshed combo.  \nDeGennaro uses a read step or a three-step release to set up slants against outside leverage. He’ll also combine a read step \nand a two-quick for the slant.  \nDeGennaro has a double up to threaten inside leverage, but the move needs more patience and suddenness. He can deliver \nit with suddenness. He also can counter it with a wipe.  \nDeGennaro’s stick is explosive when he uses it at the line of scrimmage to set up an inside release. He can counter the \ndefender’s hands with a shed.  \nHe uses a two-quick to steal a release in the running game. DeGennaro uses a hip shift against off-man coverage.  \nSeparation: The vertical and deep ranges of the field aren’t DeGennaro’s calling card. He doesn’t earn separation against \nPower-Five defensive backs. He’ll stack non-Power Five defenders on intermediate routes like the corner fade.  \nRoute Stems: He must improve the pacing of his stems so he’s accelerating into the top of the stem. He widens stems to \nset up post routes.  \nRoute Setups: DeGennaro’s hitch-and-go needs more weight drop to sell the hitch. He has an effective peek to the \nboundary on an out-and-up. He also changes the pace to set up the peek.  \nRoute Breaks: DeGennaro uses a long break step into short hitches. He drops his weight into a three-step break with a \nlong break step. He works back to the ball. He can improve his breaks with acceleration into the top of the stem.  \nWhen DeGennaro works short in- and out-breakers, DeGennaro delivers flat drive and line steps.  \nDeGennaro gets his head around from his break and presents a friendly target. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, \nhe works back to the quarterback.  \nZone Routes: DeGennaro identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nRoute Boundary: DeGennaro is aware of the boundary as a route runner and ball carrier. He toe-taps the boundary at the \ncatch point on outs and high-points.  \nWhen running fades, DeGennaro doesn’t pin himself to the sideline too early. He buys back the boundary on fade routes.  \n\n \n298 \nPass Tracking: DeGennaro can track over his shoulder with overhand position on wide routes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: DeGennaro uses overhand attack for targets arriving at his chest/numbers. He uses underhand \nattack for waist-high targets.  \nDeGennaro will catch the ball at the earliest window for targets at the numbers. He can high-point targets away from his \nframe. He can also drop to his knees and catch targets with underhand position.  \nPosition: DeGennaro can embrace the fall after high-pointing. He can also jump up and through and deliver a pullback.  \nFocus: DeGennaro can take contact to his side from tight coverage as he’s high-pointing the target.  \nTransitions: DeGennaro uses catch and pierce principles when catching a target facing the quarterback.  \nElusiveness: DeGennaro has a two-step deceleration in the open field but the movement isn’t sudden and re-acceleration \nisn’t explosive, either. He’ll spin through contact. He’s good at ducking under reaches to his frame.  \nVision: DeGennaro is willing to split defenders in the secondary.  \nPower: DeGennaro keeps his feet moving through wraps until the defender slides down DeGennaro’s waist. At that point \nthe receiver leans forward for extra yardage or pull through reaches. He has a stiff-arm to ward off reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate defensive backs.  \nBall Security: DeGennaro carries the ball close to his chest with his elbow loose from his side. He uses the boundary-side \narm.  \nBlocking: DeGennaro earns a square and squat position as he closes the gap with the Man Over Me assignment tight to the \nline and in the box. When on an island, DeGennaro overextends to deliver a strike. He aims for the defender’s chest with \ntight hands and elbows bent. When he makes contact, DeGennaro moves his feet.  \nDeGennaro attacks both Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man assignments. With Most Dangerous Man assignments where \nhe peels off a Man Over Me assignment, DeGennaro will lead with his pads into the chest of the opponent.  \nDurability: Concussion in 2024 after nine games.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor DeGennaro from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nNick DeGennaro Richmond Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n299 \nWR Winston Wright, Jr. RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: WR66 \nJersey No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/188 School: East Carolina / Florida State \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Jon Metchie/Jamari Thrash - - Tayvion Robinson/Phoenix Sproles/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 70.6 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nAppalachian State ’24  \n• \nUTSA ‘24 \n• \nFAU ‘24 \n• \nTulsa ‘24 \n \nReleases: Wright has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side \nof his front knee.  \nWright sinks into his stance and gets his pads low and over his front knee with his head facing forward. He rocks slightly off \nthe back foot.  \nWright sells the vertical potential of the route with his pads through the stem. His arms move at three-quarters the full \nrange of motion.  \nHe uses a double up against off-coverage. He counters the hands of a defender with a wipe or shed.  \nWright has a feet-switch to begin an outside release. He counters with a swat or shed \nWright uses a hip shift with a patient but sudden movement to steal a release against off-coverage. He works inside \ncoverage with a two-quick and a wipe counter.  \nSeparation: Wright has the speed to maintain separation against defensive backs. He can flip the field with his acceleration \nand speed, meaning he can extend plays 40-60 yards if he beats pursuit angles early in a play. At the same time, he can \nget caught from behind by the fastest 2-3 defenders on the field.  \nRoute Stems: Wright dives and widens stems. He attacks his stems at a good pace.  \nRoute Setups: Wright has an effective in-set at the top of his stems with a good head and shoulder fake. He also has an \neffective peek to the boundary at the top of stems.  \nRoute Breaks: Wright creates a friendly target to the quarterback. He has a drop and pop break that needs weight drop. \nHe has effective weight drop into a three-step break and works back to the ball.  \nWright runs shallow and intermediate speed outs with flat drive and line steps. He has snap turns with shallow hitches.  \nZone Routes: Wright identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and when he passes the buzz/rollover defender, \nWright shows his eyes to the quarterback. He also settles under the defense and in between the zone triangle. He’ll also \ntempo breaks across the zone with a friendly position, settling before he gets too close to the next zone defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Wright has a good feel for the boundary as a runner. He’ll extend well for the pylon to finish runs.  \nPass Tracking: Wright tracks the ball over his shoulder with overhand attack above his head or underhand as he runs \nunder the ball in front of him.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Wright can catch the football with underhand position at the numbers. He high-points effectively.  \nPosition: Wright can embrace the fall after he goes airborne with a high-point.  \nFocus: Wright can track over the shoulder with underhand attack on a wide route and take a hard hit to the chest. He can \nhigh-point and take hits to his back.  \n\n \n300 \nTransitions: Wright catches and pierces downhill. He obeys the path of the ball to determine his transition.  \nElusiveness: Wright can transition from a boundary approach to a downhill approach with two steps. He can get his feet up \nthrough reaches. \nWright can open his hips with the point of a toe to change direction 90 degrees. He jump cuts effective to slide 1-2 steps \nlaterally from unblocked pursuit.  \nVision: Wright has a patient approach on perimeter runs and will press the backside lead blocker. He can avoid unblocked \npursuit to access rushing lanes that his blockers generate.  \nPower: Wright can pull through reaches. He drops his pads into contact and can lean through the contact. He can bounce \noff a direct hit from a safety, keep his feet moving and pull through a lower-body wrap. He can push a pile 1-2 yards. \nWright wards off reaches with his stiff arm, but he can also push a defensive back to the ground with a well-placed stiff arm \nto the defender’s chest.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Wright bounces off direct collisions from cornerbacks in the open field and can at least extend \nforward through the wrap. He can win direct collisions with a safety when he has the downhill runway into the defender who \nis at a relative standstill.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Wright can take a hard glancing shot from a safety coming downhill while his back is to the \ndefender and bounce off.  \nBall Security: Wright carries the ball high to his chest when he senses pursuit is near. When in the open field, the ball is \nloose from the frame at the elbow and the chest. He swings the ball in the open field. He can carry the ball under his \nboundary side arm. He has lost the ball when backside pursuit chops at that loose elbow.  \nBlocking: Wright closes the gap with Man Over Me assignments. He keeps his elbows bent and hands tight into the chest of \nthe defender. He moves his feet after contact.  \nWright drops his weight and has a wide stance, but he overextends and hugs defenders with a downhill runway into the \ncollision. The weight drop, stance, and movement of his feet helps Wright limit the amount of steps he’s knocked backward.  \nHe can work inside-out, attacking the inside shoulder of the force defender to fan the defender outside.  \nDurability: Car accident in 2022 that resulted in a season-ending leg injury (broken leg) requiring surgery.

If Jones can develop into a starting-caliber NFL player, his best theoretical fit will be as a \nflanker based on his skills after the catch.  \nReleases: Jones has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. Jones sinks into his stance to \nbegin his release, but rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front foot. He pumps his arms with three-quarter range of \nmotion with is pads over his knees to sell the vertical.  \nJones has a two-quick release or a hesitation to steal a release in the run game. The footwork can have more artistry with \npatience and suddenness. His double up to steal a release is sudden but the contrasting patience to set it up isn’t there.  \nJones has a read-step with a shed counter, but the footwork lacks patience and suddenness to bait the defender. The shed \nis violent.  \nHis hesitation and read-step combo have a nice range of patience and suddenness.  \nHis swat is sudden. He uses it in contrast with a patient hesitation. Jones also has an effective double swat.  \nJones has a powerful shed, but must be aware of maintaining his line so he doesn’t take himself out of bounds. Jones uses a \nshoulder reduction to avoid shots from inside leverage.  \nJones uses a double up with a swat-swim counter to get inside. Jones uses a wipe to counter an outside-leverage defender.  \nJones uses a swat-swim counter at the top of stems to work inside-out on man coverage.  \nSeparation: Jones can earn between half of a step to a step on an outside-shade defender on a vertical stem that covers \nthe intermediate range of the field. Once he’s working more than 15-20 yards downfield, he has difficulty earning or \nsustaining separation against cornerbacks.  \nRoute Stems: Jones will dive or widen stems based on the leverage of the defender. He’ll run at the defender.  \nRoute Setups: At the top of his stem, Jones will work into the back of a defender playing off him on a vertical route. Jones \nhas an effective peek to the boundary to set up his out-and-up.  \nJones has a capable in-set on the slant-and-go. \nRoute Breaks: With shallow speed outs, Jones has a flat drive step and a flat line step.  \nJones has a long break step into a drop and pop break. The drop phase needs more weight drop—he lacks enough \ndeceleration to separate from tight coverage. He turns to create a friendly target to the quarterback and gets his head \naround early.  \nHis drop and pop break has some snap in the intermediate range against zone coverage, but he must cultivate snap with his \nturns for every break type.  \n\n \n302 \nJones has a three-step break, but the break step isn’t long enough and the there’s not enough weight drop to decelerate \nsuddenly.  \nJones will work back to the quarterback out of his breaks.  \nZone Routes: Jones identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly \nposition to the target. He also tempos his break across a zone.  \nJones has some feel for uncovering against zones where, at first, he’s covered.  \nRoute Boundary: Jones can drag one foot or both feet inside the boundary when catching a target well out of bounds. He’s \naware of the boundary and toe-taps to make receptions count.  \nPass Tracking: He tracks the ball over his shoulder but his hands can be too wide. He leaves his feet unnecessarily for \ntargets where he can extend his arms to attack the ball.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Jones catches beltline targets with underhand attack tight to his frame. He attempts to clap-track \ntargets away from his frame with underhand attack and if the ball is behind his break path, he tips the ball away from \nhimself.  \nJones attacks over his shoulder with overhand position while facing the ball. He uses underhand attack at the numbers \nwhen turning behind his break path to earn the ball and overhand attack is the better choice.  \nPosition: Jones has good timing with a jump up and through, but he clap-attacks with side-by-side hands position. He \nexecutes effective pullbacks toward oncoming coverage.  \nFocus: Jones can take contact to his back while extending for the ball with overhand attack. He can take a shove to his \nchest against tight coverage before the ball arrives and still make the catch.  \nTransitions: Jones catches and pierces downhill and obeys the location of the ball to determine his turns.  \nElusiveness: Jones spins through lower-body wraps and reaches to extend downhill for additional yardage. He can open his \nhips and work across the frame of an oncoming safety. He also decelerates within two steps to undercut pursuit.  \nVision: Jones is a decisive runner who also knows how to set up blocks and unblocked defenders in the open field. He has a \ngood sense of timing and movement to create open space with efficient and dynamic movement.  \nPower: Jones runs behind his pads as a finisher. His stiff-arm is effective against reaches and wraps.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He bounces off direct shots from cornerbacks.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Jones bounces off glancing shots from defensive linemen.  \nBall Security: Jones carries the ball high to his chest. He uses the boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Jones is sudden with his Most Dangerous Man approaches. He closes the gap quickly, takes the air out of the \ninteraction, and strikes with an uppercut and a roll through the hips to rock the linebacker. He also likes to lead with a \nforearm shiver rather than the uppercut. He closes the gap and delivers the shot, but he can’t sustain with this strike.  \nJones keeps his feet moving after contact to generate a push. He keeps his arms tight to maintain position with his hands \ninto the defender’s chest.  \nJones can deliver a punch, but must not sacrifice his angle of attack to do so. He misses blocks when required to slide inside \nand earn a flat lead on a defender shooting downhill to the inside of Jones’ approach.  \nJones can run off a defender and tilt into the defender once a teammate makes a catch.  \nDurability: No significant time missed.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Jones from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n\n \n303 \n• \nUncovers in Zone and Stiff Arm/Power \n• \nSmash Screen YAC \n• \nObeying the Ball \n• \nOut and Up and Wins vs. Contact at Boundary \n• \nClap-attack Drops \n• \nJ.J.

        "analysis": "## J.J. Jones Player Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Physicality:**  6'2\", 210 lbs, possesses good size and strength for the position.  Effective stiff arm and power as a runner.  Can take contact and maintain possession.  Good at bouncing off tackles.\n* **After the Catch Ability:**  Excels at making yards after the catch (YAC), demonstrating elusiveness, vision, and decisive running.  Spins through tackles and utilizes his size to break tackles.\n* **Route Running (Intermediate):** Shows proficiency in intermediate routes. Effective at creating separation, particularly in the intermediate range of the field, and uncovering in zone coverage.  Good feel for route stems and setups.  Proficient in utilizing different release techniques (hesitation, read-step).\n* **Blocking:**  Shows potential as a blocker, especially with his \"Most Dangerous Man\" approach.  Quick to engage and deliver a strong punch, although consistency needs improvement.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Deep Separation:** Struggles to create and maintain separation from cornerbacks on deep routes (beyond 15-20 yards).\n* **Route Running (Deep/Breaks):** Needs improvement in his deep route running and break techniques.  His break steps lack sufficient length and deceleration, limiting separation against tight coverage.  Inconsistent snap in his turns for route breaks.\n* **Pass Catching:**  While he shows good focus and can take contact, his hand placement and technique need refinement.  Sometimes leaves his feet unnecessarily and uses suboptimal hand positions for catching the ball.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** Although capable, his blocking needs consistency. He sometimes misses blocks due to poor angle of attack.\n* **Overall Development:** His Depth of Talent Score (66.8) indicates he's a developmental player; he needs significant improvement to become a reliable starter.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison (Dwayne Bowe):**\n\nThe comparison to Dwayne Bowe is apt in terms of size and physicality.  Bowe was a big-bodied receiver known for his strong hands and ability to make contested catches. However, Jones's deep route running and overall consistency are far less developed than Bowe's were at a similar stage in their careers.  The comparison highlights potential but also reveals a considerable gap in skill level to reach Bowe's production.  \n\n**Overall:**\n\nJ.J. Jones possesses intriguing physical tools and YAC ability, but he needs significant development in his route running, particularly deep routes and breaks, and pass-catching technique to become a consistent NFL contributor.  He projects as a developmental prospect who may need time on the practice squad or special teams before potentially becoming a rotational player.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR68 \nJersey No. 7 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10” / 178 School: South Carolina/Miami (OH) \n \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: N/A \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 62.7 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nMississippi ‘24 \n• \nAlabama ‘24 \n• \nVanderbilt ‘24 \n• \nToledo ‘23 \n \nReleases: Larvadain has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring the front foot. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \nLarvadain sinks into his stance with his pads over his knees and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion. He has reps \nwhere he rocks off his back foot.  \nLarvadain can deliver a swat-swim counter at the top of a stem. He uses a three-step break to set up an in-breaking route. \nLarvadain can use a two-quick or read step to attack outside leverage. He’ll counter the two-quick at the top of stems with a \nswat-swim. He delivers a good wipe to counter the hands of a defender.  \nHe has a double up with a wipe counter.  \nHe uses a feet-switch to steal a release. He reduces a shoulder from off-coverage.  \nSeparation: Larvadain can earn separation against a safety playing off coverage when Larvadain has a two-way-go. He can \nbeat corners playing off coverage. When unfettered with his runway, Larvadain has the speed to win deep.  \nRoute Stems:  Larvadain will dive or widen his stems early or late in the stem to set up an inset or stair step. He can dive \ninside and then take the back of an off-coverage defender.  \nRoute Setups: Larvadain delivers an inset with the turn of his hips and chest to the inside. He shows his eyes mid-stem to \nsell stems and set up breaks.  \nRoute Breaks: Larvadain has a long break step into a shallow hitch. He snaps turns on hitches. He also has a long break \nstep with weight drop into a three-step break in the intermediate range of the field.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, he will work with the quarterback to find an opening.  \nHis drive steps aren’t flat enough with intermediate breaks. His line steps are flat enough.  \nZone Routes: Larvadain identifies second-level defenders, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nRoute Boundary: N/A \nPass Tracking: Larvadain leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at chest, shoulder, and helmet height and it can cost \nhim the ball because a trailing defender gets an extra step to defend the ball. When tracking targets over his shoulder with \ndeep targets, he can leave his feet for the ball when maintaining his stride would more likely get him in range to earn the \nball.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Larvadain catches targets at his waist with underhand position. He catches targets at his chest with \noverhand position. He can high-point targets. He can make sliding catches with targets arriving into his frame and take \ncontact to his chest as he does so.  \nPosition: Larvadain can high-point and execute a pull back to keep the ball away from the oncoming defender.  \n\n \n305 \nFocus: Larvadain can high-point and take a wrap to his chest.  \nTransitions: Larvadain will catch and pierce after catching the ball facing the quarterback. He doesn’t obey the ball.  \nElusiveness: Larvadain can flip his hips 90 degrees to avoid pursuit in tight spaces. He spins through contact to continue \nforward. His spins are tight. He only needs two quick steps to transition 90 degrees on the field.  \nLarvadain can layer moves in succession. He has effective jump cuts to avoid pursuit in close quarters.  \nVision: Larvadain identifies unblocked pursuit on the periphery and adjust his path away from the defender—including \ncutting against the grain of the pursuit coming into the picture. He will press blockers to set up lanes.  \nPower: Larvadain uses a stiff arm to ward off linebackers and continue moving his feet. He pulls through reaches \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate cornerbacks \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate cornerbacks \nBall Security: Larvadain carries the ball close to his chest. He can use either arm to carry the ball. His elbow is loose from \nhis frame.  \nBlocking: Larvadain will transition from route runner to blocker. He must show more patience with his approach. He can be \nlate to earn a squat but square and overrun his approach.   \nLarvadain will run off a defender and tilt into them to shield them. Overall, Larvadain is a shield blocker who earns position \nwith a square stance but he offers light contact and that’s the extent of the interaction before the defender works past.  \nLarvadain can earn a squat and square position. He can attack with his hands tight, bend at the elbows, and aim for the \nchest. He overextends into the contact with his head and it’s when he overextends that he delivers the best strike, but it’s \nnot a sustainable effort. He can deliver his shoulder into the chest of a safety on Most Dangerous Man assignments and \ntemporarily stone the opponent.  \nHe will move his feet after contact, but he’s often pushed backward because he doesn’t punch. He will shuffle his feet to \nmove laterally, but he has difficulty maintaining contact when he does.  \nDurability: Missed time with a hamstring injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Larvadain from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nGage Larvadains’ 273-yard day vs. UMass \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n306",
        "analysis": "Gage Larvadain is a developmental wide receiver prospect with a RSP ranking of WR68.  His strengths lie in his route running and elusiveness after the catch. He displays good release techniques, utilizing various counters and footwork to create separation, particularly against off-coverage.  His route running is sharp, with effective breaks and the ability to adjust based on coverage.  He shows promise in identifying and exploiting zones. Post-catch, he's agile, capable of making sharp cuts and utilizing spin moves to avoid tackles. He also demonstrates the ability to high-point the ball and make contested catches.\n\nHowever, Larvadain has several areas for improvement. His pass tracking needs refinement, as he sometimes leaves his feet unnecessarily, impacting his ability to secure the ball.  His blocking is inconsistent, needing more patience and power in his approach.  His drive steps in intermediate routes could be improved for better consistency.  Furthermore, his durability is a concern, given a past hamstring injury.\n\nFinding a direct NFL player comparison is difficult given the lack of a provided comparison and his developmental status.  His skillset, however, suggests a potential comparison to a smaller, quicker slot receiver who excels in short to intermediate routes and after-the-catch situations.  Players like a less-athletic version of  **Cole Beasley** (pre-injury) or a more dynamic **Jakeem Grant** might be loose analogies, but it is crucial to emphasize his developmental nature.  He's a project player with high-level traits that need further refinement and consistent application.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: WR69 \nJersey No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/192 School: Toledo  \nPlayer Comparison Spectrum: Anthony Miller - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 62.4 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nMississippi State ‘24 \n• \nWestern Kentucky ‘24 \n• \nAkron ‘24 \n• \nPitt ‘24 \n \n \nTechnical: Newton’s hands are too far apart with most attacks of the ball. This leads to clap-attacking and dropped passes.  \nReleases: Newton has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either \nside of his front knee.  \nNewton sinks into his stance to begin his release. He rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. His arms move at half \nthe full range of motion.  \nNewton begins with his pads over his knees, but he gets upright too early in his stems.  \nNewton has a double up with a shed counter. Both lack precision, suddenness, and violence. He can execute his double up \nwith suddenness, but there is no artistry of blending patience and suddenness with the move.  \nHe uses a double up, stutter, or hesitation to steal a release.  \nHe uses a read step to attack outside shade and set up a stem to the inside. He combines read step with a two-quick. \nNewton combines a stick with a wipe.  \nNewton has a feet-switch to set up a release to the inside. He also uses a two-quick with a wipe counter.  \nSeparation: Newton is not a breakaway/deep threat. He wins underneath and in pockets of zone. With a good move or \ndouble move, Newton can earn 1-2 steps on a defender on vertical routes.  \nRoute Stems: Newton runs at the defensive back. He attacks his stems at full speed when setting up a downfield block. \nHe’ll also dive his stems against inside leverage. He’ll widen his stems against outside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Newton uses a slow pace with his stems on fades against off coverage and rapidly accelerates after giving a \nhead fake to the inside at the top of his stem. Newton can deliver a peek to set up a post. He can also turn his head inside \nto sell the in-breaker on a vertical route.  \nNewton works into the toes of the defender. He also runs at the defender to set up breaks back to the ball.  \nNewton wins a short flat route with a feet-switch/double up combo off the line that transitions into an inset before spinning \noutside on this break.  \nRoute Breaks: Newton drops his weight into whip routes. He works back to the quarterback if his first break doesn’t earn a \ntarget. He has a flat drive step but his line step drifts when he has lapses. When he doesn’t, his speed breaks are flat and \nhe snaps his turns, getting his eyes around to the quarterback with a friendly position.  \nNewton has a three-quick break with weight drop. He works back to the ball. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, \nNewton works to an open area.  \nZone Routes: Newton identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open zone. He shows his \neyes and creates a friendly target. When working across a zone, Newton doesn’t show his eyes until he’s ready for the ball \nand has crossed the buzz/rollover defender.  \n\n \n307 \nRoute Boundary: N/A \nPass Tracking: Newton catches targets with overhand attack at the earliest window of arrival. He attacks targets over his \nshoulder with underhand or overhand attack. He leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Newton catches targets at shoulder height with overhand position. He uses overhand position for \ntargets at the beltline, but it’s more of a side-by-side clap-attack of the ball. He also uses a high-low clap-attack for targets \nat his numbers.  \nNewton is prone to clap-attacking and when attempting to catch the target away from his frame with a clap-attack, he has \ndropped the ball. This also happens when the target is at extreme high/low ranges of his radius.  \nHe has caught targets below his knees while on his feet, and he has been successful with high-pointing the ball.  \nIn the shallow range of the field, Newton can high-point with one hand and snare the ball behind his break path.  \nPosition: Newton will jump up and through for an underthrown target, but he doesn’t use overhand attack and that allows \nhis opponents to reach the ball before him. He will embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Newton can take a hit from tight coverage at this back.  \nTransitions: Newton catches and pierces downhill after facing the quarterback at the catch point. He obeys the ball to \ndetermine the direction of his transition.  \nElusiveness: Newton has a tight spin in traffic. He can jump cut away from pursuit over the top of him. Newton only needs \ntwo quick steps to transition from an east-west path to a downhill path.  \nVision: Newton is patient in traffic. He can handle unblocked defenders in tight quarters and work to open space. He’s \ndecisive when there’s an open crease.  \nPower: Newton pulls through reaches to his frame. He drops his pads into opponents as he finishes runs into the open field. \nHe can push a cornerback with his pads and second effort.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can win collisions and generate a push against a safety meeting him downhill.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He wins collisions with cornerbacks. He has a capable balance-touch.  \nBall Security: Newton carries the ball close to his chest. His elbow is loose from his side. In the open field, he carries the \nball loose from his chest and side. He uses the boundary-side arm. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlocking: When executing Most Dangerous Man assignments, Newton gets within 3-5 yards of the opponent, squares, \nadjusts his position, and delivers a shoulder into the chest of the opponent. He can follow up with a square position and \nboth hands, but the positioning isn’t reliable because the initial hit can disrupt a shot at a second effort.  \nHe’ll slide laterally after earning position and contact with a Man Over Me defender, shuffling his feet with a wide stance. His \nhands are wide, but he moves his feet and he closes the gap.  \nNewton can peel off one assignment and take on another. He can seal the outside for a defender.  \nWhen he has lapses with overextending, he drops his head into the chest of the oncoming defender.  \nDurability: No significant injuries or missed time.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Newton from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nJerJuan Newton 2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n\n \n308 \nWR Rankings Tables: Combined, Big Slot, and Small Slot Boards \n \nCombined Board (Top 69) \n \nTimes and measurements are from Pro Day workouts. There won’t be as many as previous years due to the pandemic. \n“Potential” is my assessment of the player’s development curve based on his potential to improve his strength and \nathleticism with additional training or learn the techniques and concepts of his position.  \n \nPlayers labeled “Upside” have additional opportunities to become better athletes and/or technicians at their position. Players \nearning the “Boom-Bust” label generally have a high level of athleticism but lack the knowledge of a skill or concept that \ncould be difficult to learn.  \n \nIn some cases, these “Boom-Bust” players have excellent skills and knowledge of concepts, but the base athleticism to \nperform the job might be questionable, and the chance of them improving those physical skills are not likely. A player with a \n“Maxed” label has likely reached his athletic (or conceptual) potential, and this will limit his ability to grow beyond his \ncurrent assessment.  \n \nBased on my conversations with scouts, wide receiver rankings tend to have the greatest variance for organization to \norganization. Team fit, physical preferences, and special teams skill are three primary factors for this variation. The RSP \nPost-Draft will feature rankings that take the draft into account.  \n \nRemember that injuries, off-field issues, and other unexpected developments will make what seemed improbable today \nbecome likely tomorrow.

Each “/” between the “X” \nand a player’s name means the prospect’s talents closely resemble those of the mentioned player. The key word is “talent,” \nbecause there are some players with lesser careers listed ahead of more famous or productive peers.

It is not an updated ranking, but rather, a look at how I would have seen these players from the same starting \npoint as prospects without a team prior to the draft. Think of the list as one solely about grading talent and not landing \nspot, scheme, or how the player performed in the NFL.  \n \nThe long-term, aspirational goal of this combined list will be to develop a workable score that has some value across draft \nclasses. Because the RSP’s process is built on continuous improvement, adjustments to the scoring criteria will make this \naspirational goal difficult to attain over the course of the next few years.  \n \nThe realistic goal of this combined list is entertainment value and a starting point for the reader to conduct research on his \nown that may prove helpful for fantasy leagues. Here are possible ways this list may help:  \n \n• \nA combined present and short-term historical perspective on the value of players and draft picks at the position. \n• \nPerspective on emerging, unproven, or declining players (helpful for formulating trade value). \n\n \n322 \n• \nA short-term historical perspective with physical and athletic measurements.  \n \nAn updated three-year ranking based on how I see these players heading into the 2025 season will be available in the \nRSP Post-Draft Publication.  \n \nNote: I suggest beginning your examination using tiers by Depth of Talent Score and demarcate the tiers by 10 points: \n \n• \nTier 1: 90-100 \n• \nTier 2: 80-89 \n• \nTier 3: 70-79 \n• \nTier 4: 60-69 \n \nFocus more on the range these players fall rather than the linear order. Remember, players with a specific fit in a system \nmay score lower than their actual potential of impact will indicate which is why the RSP is implementing Scheme-Based \nanalysis for additional perspective and clarity about prospects and their short-term and long-term potential.  \n \n \n \nTier \nRank \nName \nHt. \nW \nCollege \nTalent \nBreadth \n40 \n20S \n3C \nV \nB \nCommentary \nI \n1 \nMalik Nabers \n6'0\" \n200 \nLSU \n95.3 \n86.65 \n4.35 \nN/A \nN/A \n42 \nN/A \nThe best overall technician on \nthe board and a dynamic \nplaymaker who can deliver in \nevery range of the field as a \nprimary option.  \nI \n2 \nRome Odunze \n6'3\" \n212 \nWashington \n93.6 \n89.3 \n4.45 \n4.03 \n6.88 \n39 \nN/A \nThe best overall athlete among \nthe top options who can start \nimmediately in the NFL with his \npositional skills. \nI \n3 \nLuther Burden III \n6'0\" \n206 \nMissouri \n93 \n81.55 \n4.41 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nA playmaker from anywhere on \nthe field who wins in every \nfashion expected of a WR.  \nI \n4 \nMarvin Harrison, Jr. \n6'3\" \n209 \nOhio State \n92.2 \n85.4 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nAn excellent boundary player \nagainst tight coverage who can \nwin deep with his size, focus, \nand long-speed.  \nI \n5 \nXavier Worthy \n5'11\" \n165 \nTexas   \n91.9 \n77.55 \n4.21 \nN/A \nN/A \n41 \nN/A \nScintillating speed and despite \nsome fighting of the ball, good \nroutes, a lot of tough catches \nand more physical than his size \nindicates.  \nI \n6 \nBrian Thomas, Jr.  \n6'3\" \n209 \nLSU \n91.8 \n81.4 \n4.33 \nN/A \nN/A \n38.5 \n11 \nA budding primary receiver who \nshould take over that role for is \nNFL team by Year Two.  \nI \n7 \nTravis Hunter \n6'0\" \n188 \nColorado   \n91.3 \n82.3 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nSee above but with the potential \nto become a shut-down corner \nthat could put a dent in his \noffensive value. \nI \n8 \nMatthew Golden \n5'11\" \n191 \nTexas \n89.9 \n79.95 \n4.29 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nGolden's yards per route run \n(YPPR) may look like Mecole \nHardman, but Hardman's actual \ngame never looked like \nGolden's. \nI \n9 \nKeon Coleman \n6'3\" \n213 \nFSU/Mich.

        "analysis": "## JerJuan Newton Player Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Wins underneath and in zone pockets:**  Newton excels at creating separation and catching the ball in shorter areas of the field, particularly against zone defenses. He's shown the ability to use various route combinations to find openings.\n* **Route running fundamentals:** He displays good understanding of route concepts, demonstrating proper stems, setups, and breaks, although consistency is lacking.  He knows how to work into the defender's toes and create friendly targets. His zone awareness is a positive.\n* **YAC ability and contact balance:** Newton shows promise in making defenders miss after the catch, possesses decent vision in traffic, and can win collisions, particularly against cornerbacks.\n* **Blocking:** He possesses the physical tools and effort for run blocking, particularly in \"Most Dangerous Man\" situations. However, consistency is needed.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Hand technique:** Newton's hand placement is a significant weakness, leading to \"clap-attacking\" and dropped passes.  Improving this fundamental skill is crucial for his development.\n* **Consistency:** While he possesses the technical skills, he lacks consistency in execution.  Improving consistency across all aspects of his game would dramatically raise his ceiling.\n* **Deep threat potential:** Although he's effective underneath, developing into a more consistent deep threat would greatly expand his value.\n* **Blocking consistency:**  While his effort in blocking is good,  improving his positioning and follow-through will improve his efficiency.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe primary comparison is **Anthony Miller**.  This suggests a player who can win with route running and quickness underneath but may lack the size and elite athleticism to consistently dominate at the NFL level.  The comparison also hints at potential issues with drops, mirroring Miller's career struggles in that regard.  The ranking and comments also suggest a potential lower ceiling, implying a developmental player who might need time to make an impact or find a niche role on an NFL team (special teams or a low-end rotational receiver).\n"
