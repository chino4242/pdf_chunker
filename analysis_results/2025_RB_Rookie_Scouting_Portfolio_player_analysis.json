        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB1 \nJersey: No.2 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/211 School: Boise State \nComparison Spectrum: DeAngelo Williams – X/J.K. Dobbins - - Ameer Abdullah \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 92.9 = Franchise: Immediate production and leadership anchor. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nWashington ‘23 \n• \nUCF ‘23 \n• \nUCLA ‘23 \n• \nPenn State ‘25 \n• \nOregon ‘24 \n• \nUNLV ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Jeanty is special. What sets him apart is what he has in common with Jim Brown, Walter Payton, \nSanders, Adrian Peterson, and Marshawn Lynch: Play stamina.  \nWhen you watch these five backs, you’ll notice that their play speed, play strength, and never-say-die approach to \nballcarrying retains a similar intensity at the end of long runs as at the beginning of the play. They are like boxers in the \nlate rounds who, after a war, are still throwing punches with more force and more snap than their opponents.  \nJ.K. Dobbins was borderline special before injuries. DeAngelo Williams was special, but working alongside Jonathan Stewart \ndiminished his chances to show it.  \nJeanty has the same type of play stamina. He can work through multiple reaches, wraps, and hits while also making \ndramatic changes of direction and at the end of the run, still have the juice, strength and movement to work through \ncontact as if he has just begun the play.  \nHe’s the best runner/receiver in this class and one of the best I’ve watched since I began scoring runners in this updated \nsystem several years ago. Continue reading and you’ll see all the tools that support why. It’s why I’ve focused on Jeanty’s \nplay stamina as the underlying thread to his excellent game. It’s a rare quality and Jeanty has it. \nVision: Jeanty will press within a step of his blockers before accessing the open lane. Jeanty reads interior penetration into \nthe backfield and anticipates pursuit angles to avoid them.  \nJeanty can do a better job setting up backside pullers on perimeter runs. He can get too far ahead. Jeanty is a good decision \nmaker with Duo. He’ll press a double team, read the leverage, and work to the backside of the block, taking on the \nunblocked linebacker in the hole.   \nWhen zone runs, he presses within a step of the crease and finds the bounce or cutback lane. He displays patience with \nperimeter runs to press inside before working outside.  \nHe’s a decisive tight-crease runner who takes what the defensive gives him. He limits creative forays from the dictates of \nthe blocking scheme to a minimum based on down-and-distance and game script.  \nJeanty identifies pre-snap run blitzes and finds efficient solutions to mitigate losses. He sees defenders at the third level and \nsets up second-level cutbacks as he’s hitting the initial crease.  \nElusiveness: Jeanty will adjust his stride length to set up creases between the tackles. Jeanty has some moments where \nhe clicks his heels when moving laterally.  \nJeanty can transition downhill on a perimeter approach in tight traffic within two steps. Jeanty’s curvilinear movement helps \nhim transition downhill with no extra steps and at worst, one small step. He can do this with perimeter runs to the far side.  \nHe’ll set up creases with stride length and pacing variations—often using a move like a hip-opener where he points the toe \noutside to vary pace and stride length.  \n\n \n56 \nJeanty has a good crossover juke/hip shift to set up a defender pursuing over the top from the inside to reduce the viability \nof his pursuit angle and finish off the threat with a stiff arm. Jeanty uses a head fake to sell the hip shift.  \nHe has enough control with his footwork stride length to setup multiple moves in tight space that help him weave through \ntight traffic at a high rate of speed. He excels at getting his feet up over low shots.  \nJeanty has an efficient jump stop to avoid penetration reaching the backfield after he takes the exchange. He has a tight \nspin and can defeat a defensive tackle at the exchange point as he takes the exchange. He also has a good feel for when to \nduck under contact and layers moves well in succession.  \nAcceleration: Jeanty can accelerate past box defenders and cornerbacks to the far-side boundary.  \nSpeed: Jeanty can hold off same-side cornerbacks and linebackers up the boundary for at least 40-60 yards. He can hold \noff a far-side cornerback 60 yards.  \nPower: Jeanty has good extension with his stiff-arm and places it effectively when working to the perimeter. He also uses it \neffectively when working through wraps or warding off gang-tacklers while wrapped. In addition to using a stiff arm with \ngood reach, he also uses his forearm and elbow to ward off contact that reaches him in close quarters, shrugging off \npotential wrap-ups.  \nWhen he drops his pads, he’ll take one side of the defender, keep his feet moving, and drag a linebacker larger than him \nanother 2-3 yards.  \nJeanty can get his knees and feet high when encountering contact in tight traffic, which helps him bounce off hits and earn \nadditional yardage. He has slippery power for a scatback-sized prospect. Jeanty can pull through multiple wrap attempts in \nsuccession while working in the box against all three levels of defenders when they wrap high and can’t put their body into \nthe tackle or lack a strong pursuit angle.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He’ll stalemate direct contact with a linebacker in the crease when both have momentum. Jeanty \ncould accelerate into the contact but chooses not to. He keeps his feet moving and pulls the defender along when hit and \nwrapped above the waist. He’ll also win collisions with safeties who have momentum downhill, thanks to his pad level and \nleg drive.  \nJeanty stalemates defensive ends that hit him high in the crease when he has the momentum and the defender is high and \ncoming off a block. The same is true with thinner defensive tackles who come off a block and square Jeanty in the backfield  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Jeanty bounces of indirect contact from defensive ends when they hit him in the side between \nthe pads and thighs. He does this consistently. He’ll also spin off hard contact from a defensive lineman and fall forward.  \nJeanty has a capable balance touch through glancing shots. This is a weapon in his arsenal that has frequent success. He \nalso has the contact balance to bounce off indirect shots to his legs in succession from a cornerback and a middle linebacker \nin the open field.  \nRoutes: Jeanty identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He’ll dive inside off-\ncoverage defenders on a stem for a vertical route. He’ll also widen off-coverage, finish the stem with two-quick footwork, \nand counter the defender’s hands with a double swipe. Jeanty shows his eyes at the top of stems to sell moves he’ll use at \nthe break.  \nJeanty executes good catch-and-pierce principles as a receiver, and he obeys the direction of the ball for the basis of his \nturns.  \nOn crossing routes aligned from the slot or wide, Jeanty sells the stem at a slower pace than the break, setting up the \ndefender with pacing. He’ll use pacing at the top of the stem to set up a double up after widening the off-coverage defender \nwith his stem.  \nReceiving: Jeanty uses underhand position at chest-height to catch the ball with his hands. He’ll also use overhand position \nat the same target’s height depending on the angle of the route break.  \nHe extends well for the ball high and behind his frame. He can also make the catch at a late window past his body and \nsecure it quickly.  \n\n \n57 \nJeanty displays late hands with targets that are thrown away from his break path. He can jump up and through to the ball. \nHe must develop a pullback so he can reduce the chances coverage can access his arms and the ball. He tracks the ball over \nhis shoulder. With wide routes, he has a tendency to clap-attack the football.  \nWhen a target arrives high, but catchable, Jeanty highpoints, but doesn’t get his palms to face the target and risks clapping \nthe ball between his hands. He can highpoint targets this way if the velocity on the target isn’t too strong. He can take \ncontact to the back of his legs as he highpoints RPOs. Another way he has lapses that leads to dropped passes is focus \ndrops—turning his head downfield before he secures the ball to his frame.  \nJeanty can take contact to his back as he catches the ball away from his frame. He jumps unnecessarily for RPOs when the \nball arrives at his shoulders.  \nBlocking: Jeanty will work tight to the outside shoulder of his double-team partner at tackle so he can earn a square \nposition to the defender. He does the same thing well to position himself against corner and slot defender blitzes outside the \ntackle. He’ll shield linebackers as a part of a double-team.  \nJeanty picks up interior twists with good initial position but has difficulty winning the match-up because he overextends and \ntips off his position. He also picks up linebacker blitzes but can be a step late to earn a square and balanced stance, which \nleads to him getting beaten to the punch even when he has his hands tight and bent at the elbows as he aims for the \ndefender’s chest. When he gets deep enough into the pocket early enough, he can win the matchups with tight position and \na balanced frame into the defender’s frame.  \nJeanty moves his feet well as a run blocker after earning contact. He can earn a tight position as a lead blocker and move \nhis feet well enough to turn the defender outside the rushing lane. \nJeanty will peel off his primary assignment inside that’s picked up by teammates and slide outside to take on an edge \nrusher unblocked.  \nJeanty misses Green Dawg blitzes, sliding toward a defender who is already being double teamed and leaving open the edge \npressure of the Green Dawging linebackers.  \nJeanty’s blitz pickups of A-Gap pressure on linebackers and safety blitzes has little overextension and better position in \n2024. He still overruns some A-gap pressure and loses position earl.  \nBall Security: Jeanty switches the ball to the arm away from the nearest pursuit angle in his sightline. He carries the ball \nhigh to his frame. His elbow isn’t tight enough to his frame and there’s a lot of room to punch the ball loose. This was in \n2023.  \nIn 2024, Jeanty has tightened up the elbow until he’s forces to make dynamic moves to remain upright. At that point, \nJeanty’s security is vulnerable to fumbles because defender’s can force the ball to pop out the back of his elbow with a \ndirect strike.  \nHe has 832 career touches with 10 fumbles, 1 per 83.2 touches. He only had 1 per 170 in 2022, but fumbled 5 times in 263 \ntouches in 2023 (1 per 52.6) and 4 times in 398 touches in 2024 (1 per 99.5).  \nDurability: Missed two weeks in 2023 with a knee injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: 1.01 in any format.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nOverextends and gives away position on twist.  \n• \nTransitions, hip shift, and stiff-arm. Also, speed.  \n• \nFootwork, hip mobility, and curvilinear speed  \n• \nBall security and contact balance \n• \nMissing the green dawg LB \n• \nThe potential to conflate, inflate, or underrate power, contact balance, and agility \n• \nHigh knees/feet through traffic \n• \nRun Stamina I \n• \nRun Stamina II \n• \nHighlights \n \n\n \n58",
        "analysis": "Ashton Jeanty is a highly-rated running back prospect (RSP RB1) with exceptional play stamina as his defining characteristic.  His game is compared to a blend of DeAngelo Williams, J.K. Dobbins, and Ameer Abdullah, suggesting a versatile skillset.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Unmatched Play Stamina:**  Jeanty maintains exceptional speed, strength, and decisiveness throughout long runs, even after significant contact. This is his most unique and valuable asset.\n* **Vision and Decision-Making:** He exhibits excellent vision, reading blocks effectively and choosing the best running lanes, including identifying pre-snap blitzes.\n* **Elusiveness and Agility:**  Jeanty uses effective jukes, hip shifts, and stride adjustments to evade tacklers, showcasing impressive footwork and curvilinear movement. He excels at getting his feet up over low shots.\n* **Power and Contact Balance:** Despite his relatively smaller size (5'8\", 211 lbs), he possesses surprising power, consistently winning collisions and dragging defenders for extra yards. His direct and indirect contact balance are both strong points.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  He's a capable receiver, showing good hands, route running, and ability to high-point the ball, though he needs to improve ball security in this area.\n* **Blocking:**  Shows potential as a run blocker, especially in double-team situations and picking up blitzes, although consistency is an area for improvement.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Blocking Technique:** While possessing the physical tools, his blocking technique needs refinement to avoid overextension and improve consistency in winning matchups.\n* **Improve Ball Security:**  While his fumbles per carry are not alarming overall, reducing the rate, especially when facing significant contact, is vital. His technique needs tightening to eliminate vulnerable carrying positions.\n* **Route Running Consistency:** While generally a good receiver, consistency in securing the catch, especially on challenging routes, needs development.  \n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **DeAngelo Williams:**  Shares Williams' elusiveness and ability to make people miss in tight spaces, although Jeanty's power and stamina might surpass Williams'.\n* **J.K. Dobbins:**  Similar in size and explosiveness; Jeanty aims to avoid the injury concerns that have plagued Dobbins.\n* **Ameer Abdullah:**  Reflects Jeanty's versatility as a runner and receiver, though Jeanty's power likely exceeds Abdullah's.\n\n**Overall:** Jeanty's unique stamina is a game-changer.  While needing minor refinement in certain areas, his overall skillset projects him as a potential franchise-level running back, justifying his high draft ranking.\n"

        "player_name": "Quinshon Judkins",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB2 \nJersey: No. 4 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/221 School: Ole Miss/Ohio State \nComparison Spectrum: Jonathan Taylor - X/Chris Carson/Isaiah Crowell \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 89 = Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. Judkins is on the cusp \nof Franchise: Immediate production and leadership anchor. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPenn State ‘23 \n• \nUGA ‘23 \n• \nAlabama ‘23 \n• \nNotre Dame ‘25 \n• \nOregon ‘25 \n• \nPenn State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: The fans underrated Judkins, but the people I know with NFL experience agree with the RSP: Judkins \nis one of the backs in this draft who can deliver quality starter production in nearly all phases of the position and he’s \nscheme versatile.  \nFans underrated Judkins’ explosion. It’s natural when a player like Judkins is paired with a speed back like TreVeyon \nHenderson. Just because Henderson is fast doesn’t mean Judkins is slow.  \nThe NFL Combine helped remedy some of those perspectives. Judkins is capable of sudden change-of-direction quickness \nand he accelerates well. In the open field, Judkins can maintain separation against defensive backs, if not pull away from \nthem.  \nMore important than high-end athletic ability, Judkins is a skilled runner. He knows when to be patient and when to be \ndecisive.  \nHe attacks tight creases with confidence and he’s mature about using proper game management as a ball carrier. There are \nlapses where Judkins runs into open space instead of following the scheme and it has happened in the black zone and in \nshort-yardage situations. Again, these are lapses, not habits.  \nOverall, Judkins is a wise ball carrier who is capable of turning losses into gains. His ability to see the box and make pre-\nsnap and post-snap reads of the situation is a vital reason.  \nJudkins has a good feel for getting his feet over the trash of a tight crease and working around defenders.  \nHe explodes out of lateral cuts and gets his hips downhill when cutting back to an interior crease. He adjusts stride length \neffectively to set up blocks and avoid pursuit angles. Judkins keeps his feet under him when making unexpected changes of \ndirection and that helps him create efficient solutions.  \nJudkins drops his weight suddenly with two quick steps to decelerate. He can flip his hips out of that deceleration to access \na cutback lane. He also has curvilinear speed.  \nThere’s promise with his route running against man-to-man coverage, but you’ll most frequently see Judkins targeted \nagainst zone coverage. He’s a reliable pass catcher when uncovered. Judkins keeps his feet on the ground when targets \ndon’t dictate him to leap. He has soft enough hands to pluck targets away from his frame if not too far—he’ll at least create \na second-chance opportunity.  \nAlthough linebackers occasionally beat Judkins to the punch and run through him in the A Gap, Judkins’ pass protection is \ngood and in a place to get a lot better. He can deliver a sound punch and move his feet to redirect pressure. He can also \nanchor against contact from linebackers and safeties.  \nJudkins is a three-down prospect who can outsmart defenders in the box, work around them, or through them. He’s fast \nenough to flip the field and, in some cases, author breakaway runs.  \n\n \n59 \nThink of Judkins as a mix of Jonathan Taylor and Chris Carson—rugged, sudden in tight confines, explosive enough to \ngenerate big plays, and versatile enough to win inside and outside.  \nVision: Judkins presses creases within 1-2 steps of defenders and blocks before cutting back with good suddenness. He’s a \ndecisive runner and attacks downhill with good acceleration in tight spaces. He attacks creases well.  \nJudkins is patient and creative in traffic but mature about taking what’s available in a tight crease. He’s one of the most \ncreative and efficient runners in tight creases against unblocked defenders in this class. When forced to make a dramatic \nmove away from penetration, he doesn’t overrun downhill gaps in the process than many backs do, and it helps him hit \nthose creases for strong gains.  \nJudkins had lapses where he runs to open space rather than following the scheme and managing the game as decision-\nmaking—cutting back on gap plays to temporary open space in the black zone. He had to learn to take the minimal gain as \nschemed and manage risk. When facing an unblocked defender on a play inside, he’s better at staying inside where he can \nso he doesn’t take a loss trying to bounce outside. He can still take some risks in short-yardage situations between the 20s \nthat work in college but might not in the NFL. \nJudkins is good at setting up pullers on plays working to the edge of the formation. He makes the immediate adjustment so \nhe can then work behind his teammates at full speed.  \nHe identifies run blitzes during the exchange with the quarterback and delivers efficient solutions to avoid the blitzer and \naccess an open rushing lane. This turns losses into gains.  \nElusiveness: Judkins explodes out of lateral cuts and gets his hips downhill when cutting back to an interior crease. He \nadjusts stride length effectively to set up blocks and avoid pursuit angles. Judkins keeps his feet under him when making \nunexpected changes of direction that help him create efficient solutions. He can jump cut away from interior penetration in \nthe backfield and do so efficiently.  \nJudkins drops his weight suddenly with two quick steps to decelerate. He can flip his hips out of that deceleration to access \na cutback lane.  \nHe knows how to point the toe, open his hips, and work efficiently in traffic without wasting space. He has a good feel for \ngetting his feet over the trash of a tight crease.  \nJudkins uses a spin to work off hard contact in tight creases and find open space. He has a good feel for where the open \nspace is in traffic with bodies on him. He can spin in opposite directions within succession of contact to reach that open \narea.  \nJudkins has curvilinear speed around the edge and can dip inside a safety’s good pursuit angle and get downhill with a \ntransition from a perimeter approach without added steps.  \nJustin adjusts his stride length to press creases within a step of the line of scrimmage to set up bounces or cutbacks.  \nHe can deliver a good head fake with a stick to work away from a penetration nose tackle behind the line and bounce or \ncutback to an open crease.  \nAcceleration: Judkins has the acceleration to beat a box safety to the far side flat on a bounce and re-acceleration after \ncontact. He can beat a linebacker to the short-field flat and around the corner.  \nSpeed: Judkins with his 4.38-second, speed can hold off a cornerback from the far side for a gain of 60-65 yards and hold \nthe near-side corner the entire run. He can flip the field with runs up the middle when he can beat a linebacker to the \nsecondary.  \nPower: Judkins has a powerful stiff-arm that can send defensive backs and linebackers to the ground as he works the edge. \nHe beats edge defenders to the punch with the stiff arm.  \nHe keeps his feet moving in tight creases and because he keeps his hips downhill, he forces gang tackling by all three levels \nof the defense—even without generating massive momentum. No matter who wraps him high, he fights and forces help \nfrom a second defender to end the run.  \nEven when working laterally, Judkins gets his feet high enough to work through reaches to his lower legs.  \n\n \n60 \nDirect Contact Balance: Judkins will run over cornerbacks head-on in the open field. He’ll stalemate or bounce off safeties \nwhen both defenders have momentum into the collision. He bounces off direct shots to his pads from linebackers in the \ncrease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Judkins explodes out of lateral cuts and gets his hips downhill when cutting back to an interior \ncrease. This aids his contact balance through tight creases so he can fall forward and or bounce off hits and drag defenders.  \nHe bounces off hits to his frame in the crease from linebackers and safeties. He can bounce off multiple hits and reaches \nfrom box defenders when not wrapped up.  \nJudkins has an effective balance-touch after working through contact or avoid low shots with his legs that force him off his \nstride.  \nRoutes: He has some snap and good waist-bend off a break step on stop routes. He can refine this to make it more \nexplosive and sudden.  \nWhen running routes against zone coverage, Judkins works to depth after identifying the second-level defender. He settles \ninto the open area and doesn’t show his eyes until he has cleared the buzz/roll-over defender.  \nHe anticipates contact from off coverage during stems or at the top of the stem. He’ll attack with a wipe or shed.  \nJudkins has a compelling double up that he sells with a head fake and change of pace.  \nReceiving: Judkins uses overhand position for targets at his chest and will catch and pierce downhill. He keeps his feet on \nthe ground when targets don’t dictate him to leap. He has soft enough hands to pluck targets away from his frame if not too \nfar—he’ll at least create a second-chance opportunity.  \nJudkins obeys the placement of the ball when he catches and pierces downhill. He attacks the ball effectively behind his \nbreak path with arms outstretched for the ball. He can tighten his attack so there’s no residual clapping in these scenarios.  \nHits to his frame can dislodge the ball as he’s transitioning.  \nBlocking: Judkins squares linebackers around the edge and he shoots his hands with his head up and gets his face into the \njersey with hands striking first. Judkins rolls through the hips to deliver a blow and keeps his feet moving through the \ncontact to redirect the opponent.  \nJudkins can deliver a quick cut to blitzing linebackers up the middle and at least redirect the path of the rusher. He can alter \nhis position late to deliver a glancing shot that achieves this purpose when he was considering another assignment before \nthis one arrived.  \nWhen the blitzer is his primary assignment and he earns position, Judkins can make a timely cut at the waist of a linebacker \nand shoot across and through the opponent while keeping his head up to see what he’s hitting.  \nHe can take shots from blitzing A-Gap linebackers and anchor. He’s willing to chip box defenders. He has lapses where he’s \ntoo aggressive, but he often demonstrates just the right amount of violence with his hits so he doesn’t disrupt his \nteammate’s position.  \nWhen working a double-team with a tackle, Judkins earns tight position to the correct shoulder to prevent the defender \nfrom splitting them.  \nJudkins picks up cross blitzes and can slide from a double-team to a one-on-one effortlessly. He also slides well to the edge \nto pick up corner blitzes from the slot. When faced with two points of pressure on the same side of the line, Judkins \ncorrectly sticks with the interior assignment.   \nJudkins can get beaten to the punch against interior-gap pressure from a linebacker and when this happens, he’ll get run \nover. \nBall Security: Judkins carries the ball high on his frame and with the elbow tight to his side when working between the \ntackles in tight spaces. Judkins also uses the boundary-side arm. He has 3 fumbles in 582 touches, 1 per 194 touches and \nonly 1 fumble last year in 293 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n\n \n61 \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Judkins is a top-three selection in this rookie class. He might slip to picks 5-7 before the \nNFL Draft, and draft capital could force a bigger slide if the selecting team has an established runner ahead of Judkins for at \nleast another year. I don’t care, he’s a top three selection in this rookie class.

        "analysis": "Quinshon Judkins is a highly-rated running back prospect (RSP RB2) projected as a potential three-down starter in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Patience:** Judkins excels at reading defenses, exhibiting patience in tight spaces before decisively attacking creases.

        "player_name": "Tahj Brooks",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB3 \nJersey: #28 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/214 School: Texas Tech  \nComparison Spectrum: Frank Gore/LeVeon Bell/X - - CJ Anderson \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 89 = Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. Brooks is on the cusp \nof Franchise: Immediate production and leadership anchor. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nOregon ‘23 \n• \nKansas State ‘23 \n• \nTexas ‘23 \n• \nCal ‘23 \n• \nArizona State ‘24 \n• \nIowa State ’24  \n• \nColorado ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Tahj Brooks is the highest-ranked back of three sleepers in the RSP’s top 15 at the position. My \nnickname for Brooks is Lemonade, because he routinely turned the lemons his offensive line handed him into the lemonade \nof mitigated losses and positive gains.   \nBrooks operated a highly productive lemonade stand at Texas Tech for years, earning 576 carries, 3,046 yards, and 27 TDs \nfor the past two seasons – averaging 5.3 yards per attempt each year. Listed at 230 pounds before the NFL Combine, \nBrooks has been a tackle-breaking, defender-juking, crease-creating bell-cow equipped with elite short-area quickness and \nacceleration.  \nBrooks is creative, efficient, wise as a game manager with the ball in his hands, and he doesn’t lose the football, either. \nBrooks has nearly 1,000 touches and only lost the ball 5 times.  \nHe’s also versatile. Earning 57 catches for 268 yards and a touchdown over a two-year period isn’t much, but Brooks has \nproven that he can win the ball downfield in the vertical game as part of vertical packages and at the boundary on wheel \nroutes. Brooks is also a promising pass protector who should acclimate fast to the NFL.  \nTexas Tech isn’t a hotbed for running backs, which makes it easy for the logo scouting contingent of the draftnik community \nand the NFL to overlook Brooks. They’ll downgrade him with questions about how he might translate because of Tech’s \noffensive system when all they have to do is open their eyes and study Brooks intently.  \nWhat shows up translates to the NFL. Brooks is one of the best at pressing deep into the line of scrimmage to set up \ncreases. He has quick acceleration and deceleration. His contact balance and power often defeats multiple points of contact \nduring a carry.  \nIf that’s not enough, Brooks displays promising technique against larger defenders in pass protection and reliable hands and \npositioning of his frame at the catch point. Brooks is a versatile runner who can carry the load and stay on the field until he \nneeds a breather.  \nI’ve been bullish on Brooks since last spring and he has been one of my top three backs all year. This requires some \ncontext.  \nThe RSP doesn’t deliver soap opera style rankings designed to entertain readers year-round about the NFL Draft. I prefer to \nwatch players in detail and give you one pre-draft ranking and one post-draft ranking. Because the RSP has a detailed \nevaluation process, the grades often aren’t complete enough to publish them until the process is finished.  \nThere are exceptions every year, and these are often players whose games are rich with detail on a play-by-play basis, \nthey’re used in versatile ways, and they are the centerpiece of a scheme. This makes it easy to score them completely \nwithout a lot of extra digging.  \n\n \n63 \nBrooks was one of those exceptions this year, and he scored well enough that he has been the No.2 back on my board. \nUsually, backs who have a high spot in my rankings as I’m researching have a lot of other players catch up or pass them. \nBrooks scored high enough that it never happened.  \nAlthough listed as the RSP’s RB3, Brooks is essentially tied with Quinshon Judkins for the second spot. He reminds me of \ntwo backs I liked more than most when they were prospects—Frank Gore and Le’Veon Bell.  \nBoth backs were much quicker than fast, displayed refined patience and decisiveness between the tackles, and had \nexcellent maneuverability to set up and access creases. Brooks’ skills and style of play reminds me of them.  \nI’ve heard interviewers ask Brooks about the Le’Veon Bell comps and he has redirected them to Josh Jacobs as his biggest \ninfluence. I’ve brought up Bell because I’ve focused on the patient and sudden application of footwork after pressing deep \ninto the line of scrimmage and the fact that Brooks was listed between 225-230 pounds.  \nThe player I also saw in Brooks’ game was Frank Gore. I got news for you, Brooks. Jacobs is a Frank Gore disciple in style. \nIf you compare Bell and Gore’s athletic ability and styles of play, the are key similarities.  \nMy evaluation of Brooks noted elite quickness and acceleration. I purposely underestimated his long speed. It made Brooks’ \n40-Yard Dash performance of 4.52 seconds at the NFL Combine a pleasant surprise but the other workouts in line with my \nexpectations. It’s why Brooks’ value barely changed—the workouts matched the film.  \nBrooks will not be a first day pick and unlikely a second-day option in the NFL Draft. After his NFL Combine performance, he \ncould be an early pick on Day 3. \nBrooks’ NFL Draft capital may not scream, “early-career starter,” but I bet his game will.  \nVision: Brooks uses changes of stride length and pacing to set up lead blocks on Power. He attacks tight creases on Power \nand he’s patient with their development.  \nWhen running Power, Brooks is patient with the setup of the lead block to the point that he’ll press inside within 1-2 steps of \nthe blocker to draw the linebacker or safety inside and then bounce it outside. He finds cutbacks after appropriate reads of \nleverage on gap plays.  \nBrooks identifies backside edge penetration during the exchange with the quarterback and has the footwork and strength to \navoid getting tackled for a loss. He will reverse field and take chances with cutbacks in down and distance scenarios where \nit’s advisable.  \nWith pullers on perimeter plays, Brooks can set up the linebacker or safety with a press and pace change inside so he can \ngive his puller position to open the outside.  \nBrooks is an effective tight crease runner with the skill to patiently create creases that weren’t there and exploit them. He \nalso works tight to his down blocks on gap plays to maximize the cushion between himself and the pursuit working from the \noutside. This gives Brooks more room to get downhill.  \nIn the open field, Brooks spots cutbacks and can press unblocked defenders to set them up. He also knows when to split \ndefenders and use his size and strength to earn what’s in front of him. He’s a creative, efficient, and intelligent decision \nmaker.  \nElusiveness: He’ll attempt a spin to work inside unblocked defenders cutting off his path to the outside.  \nBrooks gets his feet up through low shots. He also hurdles safeties in the open field. He has a good stutter step to set up his \nhigh feet and knees against safeties coming downhill as he clears the initial crease. \nHe has enough hip mobility to change direction 45-90 degrees at top speed in the open field.  \nBrooks drops his weight effectively to set up stop-start movement. His deceleration can be two steps with one of them a \nlong break step into a hip flip 90 degrees downhill. He has effective jump stops and jump cuts in tight space behind the line \nof scrimmage and in the open field. He’s discriminating with how he uses these moves.  \nBrooks often beats linebackers and safeties with a variety of juke combinations. The most effective is a stutter and a head \nfake with a shoulder dip. He follows up with a stiff arm.  \n\n \n64 \nBrooks combines a jump stop with the ability to open his hips with the point of his boundary-side toe. Behind the line of \nscrimmage, and in the box, Brooks layers moves in succession and is effective doing so.   \nHe only needs two steps to transition downhill – to the near-side or far-side edge. He also possesses enough curvilinear \nspeed to work around defensive backs as he bends perimeter runs up the boundary or flat.  \nAcceleration: Brooks can accelerate past box defenders on perimeter runs to the short-side of the field. He can accelerate \npast a high safety up the boundary on a run to the near sideline. He tested out with an elite score for a 20-Shuttle. On the \nfield, it’s starter caliber, which means he beats safeties that sometimes have good pursuit angles but he only beats corners \nwho get baited out of a good angle. I may be underselling how good his acceleration is.  \nSpeed: Brooks can hold off a safety above him as he works up the boundary for 20-25 yards. His tested speed is a little \nbetter than his on-field speed. He can flip the field, but he’s not a legitimate breakaway threat.  \nIf blending his tested speed in the 40-Yard Dash with his film, Brooks can break big plays in the range of 15-40 yards, but \n30-40 yards is his upper limit. If he’s able to apply what he’s learned from his NFL Combine training, to his work on the \nfield, there’s additional upside for him to unlock his speed.  \nPower: When in the secondary, Brooks finishes runs with his pads low, attacking defensive backs with his pads. He has a \ngood forearm shiver. He also has a well-timed stiff-arm to ward off safeties reaching for him as he turns the corner on a \nperimeter run.  \nBrooks’ stiff-arm is strong enough to pull through wraps to his chest from defensive tackles.   \nBrooks forces gang-tackling in the open field. He often pulls through multiple reaches, wraps, and/or hits.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Brooks wins direct collisions with safeties and linebackers. They may slide down and wrap him, \nbut he bounces off the contact and forces them low and that leads to Brooks generating yardage after contact. Brooks \nstalemates defensive tackles delivering a direct shot to his pads and chest after they have earned momentum downhill and \nhe has only a step or two of momentum.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Brooks wins indirect collisions from safeties hitting him at his legs. Brooks uses his free arm to \ndeliver a forearm shiver to greet the collision when possible.  \nBrooks wins collisions to his pads with linebackers, defensive ends, and defensive tackles.  \nRoutes: Brooks understands how to widen his stems against defenders playing off-coverage and inside shade. He also does \nit well against outside shade at the top of his stem, he’ll deliver a two-quick release move and counter the defender’s hands \nwith a double swipe. He’ll also use a swim as a counter.  \nBrooks has a patient, but sudden double up to set up an off-coverage defender in the flat as a slot receiver.  \nHe’ll work to depth against the zone defender in the second level that he identified pre-snap and settles into the open area. \nHe must snap the break, but he creates a friendly target when breaking back to the quarterback. He has a good sense of \nwhere to find open zones when the quarterback breaks the pocket. He displays snap with in-breaking routes against tight \ncoverage over the top of him.  \nReceiving: Brooks obeys the direction of the target and gets his body oriented downfield based on it. He catches and \npierces to transition downhill.  \nBrooks catches targets at chest height with overhand attack. He can attack overhand and away from his frame. He’ll also \nhigh-point and take contact to his back from tight coverage.  \nHe also can extend his arms from his frame and uses an underhand attack with targets at the beltline. He turns behind his \nbreak path and catches the ball over his shoulder. He has the hand-eye coordination to extend one arm downfield and \nsecure the ball with one hand.  \nBrooks also extends for targets at his knees and below and catches the ball with underhand position that’s tight enough so \nhe doesn’t clap-attack.  \nHe’s aware of the boundary as pass catcher. Brooks will shorten his stride so he taps both feet inbounds. \n\n \n65 \nHe can fall back with his back at the boundary, drag his feet, and attack with overhand position near his chest as he’s \nfalling.  \nBrooks will embrace the fall so he doesn’t land on the football. Brooks can take contact to his back and make the catch with \nhis arms extended for the ball.  \nBrooks is capable of attacking the ball at the earliest window, but doesn’t do it enough to earn the credit. \nHe has lapses where he clap-attacks high-low with targets arriving at his numbers or his beltline.   \nHe tracks vertical routes over his shoulder near the boundary. He can take a hard shot to his side as he secures the ball and \nembrace the fall when knocked down. He can take hits to his chest and pads as he turns through the catch point.  \nBlocking: When running a route split wide of the formation, Brooks will see his quarterback break the pocket and work \ndownfield to shield pursuit.  \nBrooks identifies A-Gap pressure, squares the blitz with his feet wide (maybe too wide), and aims for the defender’s chest. \nBrooks overextends and tips off his position and this allows the defender to work around him. He’ll hurtle himself at an edge \ndefender with his head down and this will have far less success in the NFL.  \nBrooks identifies Green Dog blitzes arriving from the same side as his initial assignment but just to the inside. He’ll peel off \nthe primary assignment that doesn’t come and earns a chip on the Green Dog blitzer. This gives Brooks’ teammates at the \nline of scrimmage time to help.  \nBrooks identifies corner and slot blitzes. He can miss blitz assignments that are his when a defender motions or shifts into a \nnew spot late in the pre-snap process. \nWhen Brooks gets his hands into a defender’s chest, he’ll roll through his hips. He can win against a defensive lineman \ncoming off a guard or tackle’s block.  \nBrooks can engulf a linebacker as a lead blocker but without an accurate strike, the defender redirects after the initial \ncontact and discards Brooks with little effort. He’ll run his feet after contact, but doesn’t sustain long enough to make it \nmeaningful unless a defender as turned the corner on him and he’s redirecting the opponent around the pocket.  \nHis hands can be too wide when matching against a defensive end and get gets his pushed into the pocket, but Brooks \nearns a tight position to the inside shoulder and can turn the defender just enough to give his quarterback time to get wide \nof the ball. \nBrooks chips defenders with his shoulder pad before releasing into the flat. He can deliver hard enough to drop an edge \ndefender.   \nBrooks can chip edge pressure. He’s timely with his attack, shoots across the defender, and shoots with good height. Brooks \nalso works through the body, even if the edge defender’s path prevents Brooks from getting completely across the body.  \nOverall, Brooks is a willing blocker with pass protection and lead blocks in the run game. He must improve his strike \nposition and timing. He also misses some blitz assignments when they change late pre-snap. If he addresses these issues, \nhe’ll become an asset in this facet of running back play.  \nBall Security: Brooks carries the ball high to his chest and tight to his side. He uses the boundary-side arm. Brooks has \n984 career touches and 5 fumbles—an average of 1 fumble per 196.8 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Brooks could be available in rounds 5-6 of rookie drafts before the NFL’s referendum on \ntheir value. If he’s an early Day Three selection, his fantasy value could rise a round, but a lot of the top backs will still be \non the board on Day Three. Talent-wise, he’s one of the best values at the position – and most have written him off without \nmuch thought. At the range you can get Brooks, it’s a low-cost exercise in finding out if I’m right.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPatience, feet, movement on Power \n• \nPatient, cutback, feet \n\n \n66 \n• \nEarly attack as pass catcher.  \n• \nForearm shiver-balance-movement in open field \n• \nLemonade Stand Work-turning nothing into something \n• \nTight-crease expertise/creation \n• \nGore-esque Lemonade-Making \n• \nPress, deceleration, hip flip, transition, and cutback \n• \nWheel route vs. hard shot at boundary \n• \nPenetration mitigation \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nCareer Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n67",
        "analysis": "Tahj Brooks is a highly productive running back from Texas Tech, ranked as the RSP's RB3 (essentially tied for RB2).  He's characterized as a creative, efficient, and intelligent player who excels at turning unfavorable situations into positive gains—hence the nickname \"Lemonade.\"\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Patience:** Brooks displays exceptional patience and vision, pressing the line of scrimmage to identify and exploit creases, even creating them where none initially exist. He's adept at reading blocks and making timely cuts.\n* **Elusiveness and Agility:** He possesses elite short-area quickness and acceleration, along with impressive agility, utilizing a variety of moves (jump cuts, jump stops, spins, stutters) to evade tacklers.  His contact balance is exceptional, allowing him to consistently gain yards after contact.\n* **Power and Strength:** Despite not being exceptionally fast (4.52 40-yard dash), Brooks is a powerful runner who can break tackles and force missed tackles. He finishes runs strongly, especially against smaller defenders.\n* **Versatility:** While his receiving numbers aren't prolific, he's shown the ability to be effective as a pass catcher, especially on wheel routes and in the flat. He's also a promising pass protector.\n* **Ball Security:** With nearly 1000 career touches and only 5 fumbles, he demonstrates excellent ball security.\n* **Durability:** He has a strong injury history.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **NFL Scheme Fit:**  His success might depend on finding an NFL team that utilizes his strengths.

        "player_name": "Damien Martinez",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB4 \nJersey: No.6 (Oregon State) / Miami  \n \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/217 School: Oregon State/Miami  \nComparison Spectrum: Adrian Peterson - Ryan Mathews - X - Ryan Grant \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 86.4 = Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUCLA ‘23 \n• \nCal ‘23 \n• \nWashington ’23  \n• \nFlorida ‘24 \n• \nCal ‘24 \n• \nFlorida State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Martinez is a dynamic runner in the disguise of a lunchpail volume runner. He’s a little of both.  \nA smart, savvy, reliable, and powerful back who can work inside, outside, and in space, Martinez, gets my vote as one of \nthe 3-4 safest running backs on the board. He has a grasp of a variety of run schemes and he manages the game well as a \nball carrier, which is vital for starting in an NFL offense.  \nMartinez is a confident tight-crease runner regardless of blocking scheme. He’s also an efficient cutback runner. He \nintegrates movement effectively into his game and this helps Martinez make penetrating defenders miss or limits the \neffectiveness of their tackle attempts.  \nHis contact balance is one of the traits of his game that sets him apart. Martinez isn’t Earl Campbell, but he runs through \nmost forms of hits at every level of the defense, and he has demonstrated that he can run through multiple shots during an \nattempt.  \nMartinez’s versatility with run schemes, power, contact balance, and footwork give him multiple ways to win yardage. Still, \nat his best he’s a one-cut, downhill runner who thrives on zone and toss plays to the perimeter.  \nMartinez has the acceleration downhill to beat box defenders into the secondary. He also has enough acceleration to do the \nsame on Toss to the near-side boundary. Once in open space, Martinez glides past defenders and is a little faster than he \nappears. I bet this was the reaction of observers of his workouts at the NFL Combine.  \nMartinez is a good outlet receiver who can beat linebackers one-on-one or leak to the open zones after taking a pay-action \nfake. He’s technically sound with his attack of the ball, which he tracks well. He’s a reliable check-down option.   \nAs a pass blocker, Martinez steps deep into the pocket to take on blitzes. He diagnoses pressure well, but his attack needs \nwork. He can stuff defenders, but his positioning and attack at the catch point can also allow defenders to put Martinez on \nhis butt.  \nA lot of people are excited about the prospect of landing Omarion Hampton or Cam Skattebo, big backs who can earn \nvolume and have elements of dynamic athletic ability in their games. The team that lands Martinez might be one of the \nwisest.  \nVision: Martinez runs zone with a lead blocker effectively. He presses inside his lead blocker toward the double team inside \nand gets within a step of his blockers before bouncing back to the lead blocker’s path and the open crease. He’ll press within \na step of defenders in zone coverage. He identifies interior and edge penetration into the backfield.  \nMartinez works Duo, Counter, Windback, and Power effectively. He takes what’s available to him, especially in down-and-\ndistance and field position scenarios where risk-taking should be limited. If he bounces away from a designed gap because \nit’s filled, he’s between the 20s and he doesn’t string the play out too far. He’ll work to the next available gap if the \nperimeter isn’t wide open and then takes what he can get.  \nMartinez is a confident tight-crease runner regardless of the blocking scheme. He posts efficient cutback opportunities in the \nopen field.  \n\n \n68 \nElusiveness: Martinez has enough mobility in his knees and hips to make 45-75 degree turns with the opening if his hips. \nHe alters his stride length to set up bounces and cutbacks from a position within 1-2 steps of his linemen.  \nMartinez and pair a hip-opener with a pressure cut downhill when working behind the line of scrimmage to avoid penetration \nand then access the crease just inside the containment’s angle.  \nMartinez uses shoulder fake and stutter to set up a safety’s angle in open field so he can turn a head-on collision into a \nglancing shot. When wrapped high, Martinez keeps his feet moving and spins to pull free of the defender.  \nMartinez isn’t a sudden stop-start mover who will avoid a lot of unplanned obstacles, but he can come to quick enough stop \nto avoid some box defenders with interior penetration into the backfield. He uses jump cuts effectively in one-on-one \nsituations, especially in the open field.  \nMartinez has an effective jump stop that transitions into opening his hips and dipping inside pursuit over the top. He has \nsome underrated moves in succession to set up creases as well as unblocked defenders in the open field.  \nMartinez is at his best as a one-cut, downhill runner who leans on pressure cuts. On Toss to the near-side boundary, \nMartinez can transition downhill from a diagonal path to the boundary with one prep step. Also on Toss, Martinez will use a \ndouble-up juke to set up containment to work outside of it.  \nHe can drop his weight at the short-side edge of a perimeter bounce and transition downhill with two steps. Martinez is good \nat adjusting his stride length and calibrating his stride length on whether the blocking is gap or zone.  \nMartinez gets his feet and knees high through low shots from backside pursuit in the crease. He adjusts his stride length \nand pace on zone runs to set up blocks as he approaches the line of scrimmage.  \nAcceleration: Martinez has the acceleration downhill to beat box defenders into the secondary. He also has enough \nacceleration to do the same on Toss to the near-side boundary.  \nSpeed: He’s a gliding runner so I’m not sure how fast he really is. Probably a little faster than he looks.  \nPower: Martinez has the power to run through multiple tackle attempts during a carry when he has some momentum \ndownhill into a crease. He can pull through the reach of a safety and then a wrap to his chest from a linebacker.  \nMartinez runs upright for his height and that limits some of the potential of his strength for work between the tackles. He \nmakes an effort to dip the pads when one-on-one with opponents in the secondary and open space. He initiates contact in \nthese scenarios.  \nStill, he can carry a defensive tackle another 5-7 yards when his momentum is greater than the tackle wrapping him high \nand from behind or alongside from a standstill. He also can generate a push and get help from his teammates for 3-4 yards \nafter a wrap when his pads are high.  \nWhen Martinez’s pads are low entering a crease, he’s tough to wrap up and can knife through contact. He breaks multiple \ntackles when he can get his pads low or deliver the forearm shiver.  \nHis stiff-arm is strong enough to ward off contact to his frame, including lead blockers getting pushed back into the crease \nas he’s entering it. He also uses it to shrug off reaches from defensive backs as he creases the defense.   \nDirect Contact Balance: Martinez can bounce off a head-on collision with the safety when he gains downhill momentum \nthrough a crease. He stalemates linebackers in the crease. He can win against a flat-footed linebacker. He can also deliver a \nforearm shift and drop a linebacker who is flat-footed and trying to wrap.  \nHe can drop a defensive tackle on his behind when heading downhill and the defender is working at an angle toward \nMartinez.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Martinez can bounce off glancing shots to his pads from defensive tackles and defensive ends, \nand force them to wrap, drag, and get help from teammates to bring him to the ground. He can bounce off multiple hits \nfrom defenders during a run, including an edge defender and a safety delivering solid shots.  \nRoutes: Martinez works to depth against the second-level defender in zone coverage and settles into the open area, \ncreating a friendly target for the quarterback.  \n\n \n69 \nHe stems circle routes effectively against off-man coverage. He uses a head fake and/or his eyes to sell the fade before \nbreaking inside.  \nReceiving: He’ll attack numbers-higher or belt-high targets with underhand position away from his frame. He obeys the \nball and catches and pierces with his transitions so he’s attacking downhill immediately.  \nMartinez attacks the ball over his head with tight hand position and his feet on the ground unless it’s necessary to leap. He \ncan win the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage at his back.  \nMartinez could have more success avoiding some contact if he caught targets over the shoulder with overhand position \nbased on the placement. He’ll work with the quarterback after his first route doesn’t earn a target.  \nBlocking: Martinez spots edge and interior pressure, works to depth into the pocket, sets up with good bend to square the \nopponent, and times his cut blocks well. He earns height on the opponent as he works across and through the blitzer. He \nkeeps his eyes up to see what he’s hitting.  \nMartinez identifies edge pressure off twists. He also diagnoses cross-blitzes. When chipping a defender, Martinez winds up \nwith a bolo punch that can drop an edge defender to the ground.  \nWhen executing stand-up assignments, Martinez gets square with good bend and shuffles his feet with a wide stance. He \noverextends into the contact which can tip off opponents and it limits his ability to strike even when his hands are out and \nhis elbows are bent. He forces himself to catch contact or hug the oncoming defender instead of punching. It allows \ndefenders to counter without resistance and win the interaction.  \nHe has the size and anchor to withstand collisions with safeties and lighter linebackers when beaten to the punch due to his \noverextension, but it doesn’t project well for the NFL game. Middle linebackers can push him back and onto his ass.  \nWhen Martinez can earn position and not lose in the collision, he will keep his feet moving. He steps up well in the pocket \nand into the line to meet pressure.  \nBall Security: Martinez carries the ball close to his chest in traffic. The elbow is looser from his side than it should be. He \nuses the boundary-side/play-side arm based on the design of the player and if he cuts back, he only switches the ball if he’s \nin enough open space to do so.  \nIn the open field, Martinez carries the ball low and away from his frame, and he is prone to swinging the ball. He has 4 \nfumbles in 547 touches, 1 per 136.75 touches in 3 seasons. He didn’t fumble in 2024—176 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I consider Martinez an early-to-mid first-round talent in this draft class in fantasy leagues. \nThere may be leagues where he’s a late-first or even a mid-second in value. That valuation from fantasy leagues may \nchange quickly after the NFL Draft, but he’s likely a Day Three selection.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPower \n• \nPad Level \n• \nPressing creases, mobility, and finishing power  \n• \nOne-cut runner with complementary mobility \n• \nPairing efficient mobility with vision and contact balance \n• \nAttack, tracking, and focus as a receiver \n• \nLeverage read, press, hip-opener, forearm shiver \n• \nContact balance and navigating a loaded box in short yardage  \n• \nPass pro: Overextension but good redirect \n• \nSets up split of double team on duo and contact balance \n• \nAttacks targets at earliest point and underrated mover \n• \nTight-crease running, contact balance, burst \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n\n \n70",
        "analysis": "Damien Martinez is a powerful and versatile running back projected as an early-to-mid first-round pick in fantasy drafts.  His RSP ranking of RB4 reflects his high potential.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power and Contact Balance:** Martinez excels at running through contact, consistently breaking tackles and pushing for extra yardage. His ability to run through multiple defenders is a standout trait.\n* **Versatility:**  He's comfortable running inside and outside, handling zone and power schemes effectively. He's not solely a one-dimensional runner.\n* **Vision and Elusiveness:** While not exceptionally shifty, Martinez demonstrates good vision, identifying and exploiting creases efficiently. His ability to make subtle cuts and adjustments to avoid defenders is notable.\n* **Receiving Ability:** He's a reliable check-down option, capable of beating linebackers in coverage and possessing good ball tracking skills.\n* **Pass Blocking:** Shows potential in pass protection, though his technique needs refinement. He diagnoses pressure well.\n* **Durability:**  Has a history of playing consistently without major injury concerns.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Pass Blocking Technique:**  While he displays potential, refining his pass blocking technique will solidify his role in the NFL.\n* **Increased Receiving Production:** Maximizing his receiving skills and becoming a more consistent threat in the passing game could greatly enhance his value.\n* **Top-Tier Draft Position:** A strong showing at the NFL Combine or Pro Days could boost his draft stock.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum (Adrian Peterson - Ryan Mathews - Ryan Grant) highlights the blend of power (Peterson), balanced skill-set (Mathews), and reliable production (Grant) in Martinez's game.  He doesn't perfectly match any one player but embodies elements of all three.  His style is described as a dynamic runner with lunch-pail consistency.  He is considered one of the safest running back prospects in the draft.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB5 \nJersey No.3  \nHeight/Weight: 6’4”/222 School: TCU \nComparison Spectrum: Deuce McAllister-Cordarrelle Patterson/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 84.6 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \nWilliams is on the cusp of Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): I tracked Williams as a receiver. I tracked his 60 total rushing attempts this \nyear against all teams TCU faced.  \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Williams has the physical traits and contact skills of a running back. He has handled those duties well \nenough between the tackles at TCU that he might transition to the position permanently. If not, Williams has the receiving \nskills to become of truer vision of what the Vikings hoped when they drafted Cordarrelle Patterson. \n \nPatterson was an excellent college receiver at Tennessee. Patterson could run routes, make contested plays, and he was a \nterror in the open field.  \n \nAccording to my colleague Russ Lande, many scouts ascertained that Patterson had difficulty translating information from \nthe whiteboard to the field. Patterson had difficulty with the conceptual adjustments NFL receivers had to make at the line \nof scrimmage and early post-snap so they’d be on the same page with their quarterback.  \n \nIf Patterson didn’t have this difficulty, he could have become a productive starter in the NFL in addition to a dangerous \nreturn specialist with running back talents. As many repeat RSP subscribers know, Patterson was the best open-field runner \nI ever saw as an evaluator.  \n \nWilliams has the physical and technical tools to become a starting NFL receiver. He has learned a variety of maneuvers to \nrelease from coverage at the line of scrimmage. The next step is to develop better pacing with their execution so he can bait \ncornerbacks. \n \nAlthough Williams lacks a lot of route setups at this point of his career, his willingness to attack leverage at full speed is a \nrefined tactic that few receiver prospects do well at the college level. This makes the setups he uses all the more \nconvincing.  \n \nTwo types of breaks that Williams runs need cleaning up. He gets hung up with his footwork coming out of one break and \ndoesn’t drop his weight enough with the other.  \n \nThese are correctable issues. As is the case with his setups, Williams delivers his breaks with a detail that many prospects \ndon’t, and that’s snapping the turns with the punch of his sideline arm.  \n \nAs an evaluator, I’d rather see a wide receiver prospect with a few tools in his kit, but delivering refined execution with \nthem in hand. It’s easier to add more tools when a player demonstrates that he has mastery with the existing ones.  \n \nTCU receivers are victims of logo scouting. Fans point to them only getting use on one side of the field. They also point to \nJalen Reagor, Josh Doctson, and Quentin Johnston – early-round receivers whose careers have been disappointing relative \nto expectation – and say TCU is a bad college for drafting wide receiver prospects.  \n \nBeside the fact that logo scouting is a bad idea, Williams is a different player than these three. He also played different roles \nat TCU during his career and lined up in different spots.  \n \nIf Williams bears any similarities to one of these players, it’s to Johnston’s good traits. They are promising route runners \nand skilled after the catch.  \n \nWilliams has some catch-point issues, but they are not as problematic as Johnston’s. Williams doesn’t have difficulty \ntracking the football on vertical routes and earning position where he can optimize his opportunity to catch the ball.  \n \n\n \n71 \nWhen Williams has a lapse with good technique, it’s a focus drop to check coverage, open field, or the boundary. Another \ntype of lapse occurs with targets on his numbers. He attempts to use underhand position rather than overhand position. You \nsee this a lot in the NFL. He attacks at the earliest point, but the position isn’t ideal.  \nA third lapse is something I see far less of with his game, but it’s clap-attacking targets over his shoulder with underhand \ntechnique while extending his arms for the ball. This is one of Johnston’s issues as well, but it was far more prevalent with \nJohnston’s game in college and as a rookie.  \nWilliams makes difficult-clutch catches and he makes the easy catches. If he remains a receiver in the NFL and he drops the \nball, you’re going to hear arm-chair logo scouting. Just leave the foolishness alone. It’s like trying to argue with a drunk \nflat-earther.  \nAfter the catch is where Williams’ career could go an entirely different direction. He’s one of the two best ball carriers at the \nreceiver position in this class, and what Williams can do with the ball in his hands is unique to any receiver or tight end this \nyear.  \n \nThe 6’4”, 222-pound Williams is a big, swift, agile, and powerful running back. Not “like a running back.” He is a capable \nrunning back.  \n \nBy the standards the RSP evaluates running backs, Williams has the potential to generate elite power and elite contact \nbalance. He runs through reaches, wraps, and hits from all three levels of the defense – often some combinations on the \nsame touch.  \n \nHe can improve his finishing power and position against wraps. If he does, he’ll be an elite producer after contact.  \n \nWilliams has experience working between the tackles because TCU has used him as a perimeter runner and a between-the-\ntackles back. He has learned a lot about how to blend patience and decisiveness based on his keys, but his menu of running \nplays is limited. Most of what he runs are gap plays and often in the Wildcat. He’ll need more exposure and time to \nacclimate to other play types to become a full-time runner.  \n \nIf I gave Willians an upside bonus for his vision based on what I’ve seen – and there’s a good argument in favor of it --- \nWilliams would have been fourth on my board ahead of Damien Martinez. Ultimately, it was wiser not to award these points \nbecause, as good as he was with the plays he ran, zone plays are a lot different and can be a difficult transition. It means \nWilliams’ best fit will be Gap and, maybe outside zone, but it could limit him to situational touches. This is great for a wide \nreceiver, but if he’s going to be a full-time runner, he may need more time.  \n \nWilliams has good footwork and hip mobility to set up blocks as well as bait unblocked defenders. I’m also scouting Wiliams \nas a wide receiver. Much of what you’ll read here will be in that chapter, but with insights about his potential as a receiver.  \n \nIf Williams can prove that he’s adept at translating the whiteboard to the field as receiver, he could become valuable hybrid \noption. Any offense could easily feature Williams from the backfield as a receiver.  \n \nThis will generate excellent matchups against linebackers and safeties in space. If the defense responds with a smaller \ndefender over Williams to cover from the backfield, the quarterback can audible to a run and have the matchup advantage \nbetween the tackles.  \n \nAs long as Williams displays the intelligence and character a team seeks from a player with his skills, he should be an easy \nselection and one a team makes with enthusiasm because there are multiple ways Williams can help a team win—receiver, \nrunner, and return specialist. He could excel at one, two, or all three roles.  \n \nVision: Williams reads his blocks and presses within 1-2 steps of his lead blockers before making the cut into the hole. He \nhas good timing with moving away from unblocked defenders in tight confines. He’ll also press the crease as deep as he can \nbefore deciding to reverse field.  \nWilliams reads pursuit effectively in the open field and makes efficient dips to find open space.  \nWilliams has strong peripheral vision with pursuit from behind and outside. When used as a runner from the backfield, \nWilliams must read safety leverage better on gap plays where he has an opportunity to cutback inside a defensive back on a \nperimeter run.  \n\n \n72 \nHe’s a decisive gap runner and short-yardage player who hits the crease with authority. When there’s penetration into the \nbackfield and more than one point of penetration to the play-side of a gap play, Williams takes what he can get instead of \nattempting a high-risk cutback. He will make a cutback if the play warrants.  \nWhen Williams clears the initial crease, he spots the open space in the second level and he can bounce the run across the \nfaces of linebackers and/or safeties to reach the flat and turn the run into a big play.  \nWilliams is at his best on perimeter plays. He finds cutbacks after pressing the edge and finds them in tight creases. He \nreads leverage well in traffic for a wide receiver playing running back in a situational role.  \nMost of his runs are gap plays or with lead blockers. He’s skilled in this respect, but may need time acclimating to working \nbehind the quarterback, running a larger menu of zone plays, duo, and a wider selection of gap plays.  \nElusiveness: Williams uses sticks and dips to avoid pursuit and he’ll gets his heels up to avoid defenders reaching for his \nfeet a second time as he lifts out of wraps and reaches. He’s also good at timing ducks under reaches and wraps.  \nWilliams times hurdles well in the open field. He also has good timing with his goal line leaps over the pile. His spin in the \nopen field is tight and timely.  \nHe has sharp pressure cuts and short lateral and jump cuts. His curvilinear speed along with his ability to open his hips with \nthe point of the toe helps Williams earn the short-side edge and bend around linebackers and defensive backs.  \nWilliams presses deep and when no crease is open, he points the toe to the boundary, opens his hips, and makes the \nefficient turn outside.  \nWilliams can deliver moves in succession, including dynamic cuts, to make multiple defenders miss in the open field. He \nonly needs 1-2 steps to setup a transition downfield from a perimeter approach. \nWilliams varies his stride length to set up blocks and defenders when working between the tackles.  \nAcceleration: Williams is fast enough to beat safeties and some cornerbacks—even when bouncing the play from the \nmiddle of the field at the second level to the boundary. \nSpeed: Williams has starter speed and close to elite speed. He had a run at TCU this year that hit 22 mph, which is elite.  \nPower: Williams routinely runs through reaches and wraps. Williams pulls through reaches to his lower legs from \nlinebackers. He pulls through reaches to his upper body from defensive linemen. He’ll also pull through wraps from \nlinebackers wrapping his upper body. Williams has an effective stiff-arm to aid him. He keeps his feet moving through \nmultiple wraps, reaches, and hits, and pushes the pile against all three levels of defenders.  \nWhen working the perimeter on a designed play, Williams drops his pads under the wrap attempts of defenders and this \nhelps him turn the corner and get up the boundary for additional yardage.  \nHe’s a physical short-yardage runner.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Williams bounces off direct shots from linebacker, safeties, and cornerbacks. He has a strong \nbalance touch as well.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Williams bounces off the glancing shots of defensive linemen with a runway. He can all initiate \nthe contact at the goal line and when wrapped, he pulls through the lineman and drags him 2-3 yards.  \nHe’ll bounce off hard shots to his legs from linebackers with a runway. It can be a small runway as a red-zone ball carrier.  \nRoutes & Receiving: Williams has the routes and receiving skills to become a viable NFL starter as a wide receiver. See his \nscouting report in the receiver chapter.  \nBlocking: Williams is a physical blocker. He’ll overextend with his hands, but he squares up the defender with a squat \nposition. When he overextends, his arms can get too straight for him to avoid getting rag-dolled in the NFL against stronger \ndefenders.  \nMore often, Williams closes the gap quick enough for his arms not to get locked out. He also keeps his hands tight enough \nto get into the breastplate of the defender.  \n\n \n73 \nWilliams shuffles his feet well to generate lateral movement as a stalk blocker. After delivering a punch and getting his \nhands into the defender, Williams keeps his feet moving to maintain position against the defender.  \nWilliams also comes off his perimeter assignments, locates the safety and delivers hard shots to the chest with his forearms \n– timing the trajectory of his path to the safety from a good distance. He can handle Man Over Me and Most Dangerous Man \nassignments on the same play.  \nBall Security: Williams carries the ball high to his chest and close to his chest. The elbow is tight to his frame and he \ndoesn’t swing the ball in traffic. The ball can get loose from his frame when working in the open field and shedding wraps or \nmaking dynamic elusive moves.  \nWilliams switches the ball to his boundary-side arm when he gets the first opportunity, but has reps where he forgets. He \ncan take contact to the ball and maintain possession.  \nHe has 1 fumble in 60 carries from behind the line of scrimmage as a running back. As a football player, Williams has 1 \nfumble in 216 touches.  \nDurability: Played only 14 games in freshman and sophomore seasons due to injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Before the NFL’s referendum on these players, I’m willing to consider Williams in the \nsecond round of rookie drafts because, at worst, I expect he can become a starting receiver with an 800-1,100-yard ceiling. \nAt best, he could become a running back with a ceiling of 2,000 yards from scrimmage and double-digit scores.  \n \nIf the NFL team that drafts Williams chooses Williams as a running back, his value could have greater variance.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStem, stair-step, inset, tracking, vs. contact \n• \nClutch catch between two defenders \n• \nWorks back to the ball and open-field running \n• \nLow and behind with underhand and away from frame \n• \nSharp break vs tight coverage \n• \nPower and Contact Balance \n• \nFull-extension grab \n• \nHigh-points with jump up and through between two tight defender for TD \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n74",
        "analysis": "Savion Williams is a versatile offensive weapon with RB5 ranking, possessing a unique blend of size (6'4\", 222 lbs), speed, and agility.  His skillset makes him a compelling prospect for the NFL, with potential at running back or wide receiver.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Physicality:** Williams excels at running through tackles, demonstrating elite power and contact balance. He's a strong runner between the tackles and on the perimeter.  His size makes him difficult to bring down.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  He displays refined route-running techniques, especially attacking leverage, and has the potential to become a starting NFL receiver.  His after-the-catch ability is exceptional for a receiver, and even among running backs in his class.\n* **Versatility:** He can contribute as a running back, receiver, and potentially return specialist. This versatility makes him a valuable asset to any team.\n* **Ball Security:**  While he has some issues with ball security in the open field, his overall fumble rate is low.\n* **Vision:** He displays good vision in reading blocks and making decisive cuts.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running Refinement:** While his route-running is already advanced for a college player, improving consistency in his breaks and developing a wider array of setups will elevate his receiving game.\n* **Running Back Development:** If he focuses on running back, expanding his repertoire of running plays beyond gap schemes will be crucial.  Mastering zone schemes could significantly enhance his value.\n* **Translating to the NFL:**  Successfully translating his college success to the NFL, especially in terms of consistently reading defensive schemes, will determine his overall impact.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison to Deuce McAllister highlights his potential as a powerful and versatile back.  The Cordarrelle Patterson comparison emphasizes his open-field running ability and potential as a receiver, although it also acknowledges the need to improve his ability to process information on the field, a weakness Patterson had.  The comparison to Quentin Johnston points to a shared skillset of promising route running and strong after-the-catch ability.  However, Williams exhibits fewer issues with tracking the football than Johnston.  Ultimately, his NFL role and success will depend heavily on which position he's primarily deployed.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB6 \nJersey: No. 32 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/202 School: Ohio State \nComparison Spectrum: Kenny Irons - X - D'Andre Swift/Jerick McKinnon \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 84.6 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \nHenderson is on the cusp of Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPenn State ’22   \n• \nMichigan ’21  \n• \nPenn State ‘21 \n• \nIowa ‘24 \n• \nPenn State ‘24 \n• \nMichigan ‘24 \n• \nOregon ‘25 \n• \nTexas ‘25 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Henderson is one of the most explosive scat backs in this class. He’s an electric runner who does his \nbest work in space, but if the play design between the tackles unfolds as drawn up, Henderson can win there, too.  \nHenderson is a dynamic mover and there are scenarios where he unnecessarily lives and dies by this style of movement. His \ngame would benefit if he learned when to apply more efficient movement, but this may prove to difficult after so many \nyears where his movement style is ingrained into his game.  \nWhen forced to create in one-on-one situations between the tackles against defenders filling the gaps or in the hole against \na second-level defender, Henderson doesn’t beat these opponents as often as he should. He doesn’t deliver efficient and \neffective movement to create. He’s a better open space creator than an in-box creator.  \nHenderson is at his best as a gap runner because he can maximize his skills to open one crease. Zone running demands \nmore conceptual fluidity for setting up alternate options and he’ll need more efficiency of a movement to maximize his \nexecution in this blocking scheme.  \nIt’s not to say Henderson can’t produce in a zone scheme. He presses creases deep enough and reads leverage effectively \nas an inside runner. It’s just that he’s not as skilled with zone schemes when the blocking doesn’t unfold as designed and \nhe’s forced to create behind the line of scrimmage and tight to blocks. This is where Quinshon Judkins excels, and why the \nBuckeyes always paired Henderson with a complementary backfield partner. \nHenderson isn’t a first-level pile-pusher, but he can ward off contact with a stiff arm, and he generates momentum-based \npower to drag defenders that wrap him high. Henderson has lapses with his feet where he’s not in the position he could be \nto keep his feet moving after he’s wrapped. He bounces off hits from second- and third-level defenders.  \nHenderson has been a reliable receiver. He can improve which style of attack to use based on the location of the target. \nThis could prove more important to his reliability in the NFL where every good detail a player executes can widen the narrow \nmargin for error.  \nHenderson must learn to strike with his hands as a pass protector. He’s good at diagnosing pressure and earns good \nposition.  \nWhen he times his hands well and earns good position, Henderson can stone box defenders in one-on-one scenarios in the \npocket. Right now, Henderson rarely earns good strike position with his hands and he’s either pushed back into the pocket \nor overextends and tips off his opponent.  \nHenderson is unlikely to become a full-fledged feature back like Alvin Kamara or Christian McCaffrey – or even the  high-end \naspirational comp on his comparison continuum, Kenny Irons. Still, his game is good enough to earn a combined 1,400-\n1,500 yards and 60-80 receptions as a peak year. It may disappoint some, but it’s most likely Henderson earns 1,000-1,200 \nyards from scrimmage with 50-70 receptions and giving up red-zone opportunities to situational contributors.  \n\n \n75 \nVision: Henderson reads penetration off the edge during the exchange with the quarterback and will use quick jump stops \nto alter his path from the pursuit. He’ll press creases within 1-2 steps of the line of scrimmage before veering or cutting \nback to the open crease.  \nHenderson reads leverage effectively as an inside runner. He anticipates the splitting of a double team upon approach. As \nan outside runner, he will freeze box defenders with a small hesitation inside before bouncing to the next crease.  \nHe’s a capable gap runner inside and outside. His timing and setups of lead blocks are effective when the play development \nis straightforward.  \nWhen forced to create in one-on-one situations between the tackles against defenders filling the gaps or in the hole against \na second-level defender, Henderson doesn’t beat these opponents as often as he should. He doesn’t deliver efficient and \neffective movement to create. He’s a better open space creator than an in-box creator.  \nWhen he has lapses as a decision-maker, Henderson bounces plays outside because he spies an unblocked second-level \ndefender in a large gap and doesn’t attack downhill. He bounces these plays into favorable leverage for the defense at the \nedge and forgoes short gains he could have earned. This has happened in the red zone.  \nAnother lapse he has that’s less common is working too fast to the line on zone runs where he could press with greater \npatience and have more opportunity for a cutback. Henderson has shown patience between the tackles on zone runs, \nadjusting his stride to anticipate the lane opening and then hitting it for a big play.  \nElusiveness: Henderson has quick stop-start movement and jump stops and jump cuts that he pairs well with lateral steps \nto slide across gaps and transition downhill. This can have a similar effective of transitioning downhill without need for extra \nsteps. He can get his feet over low shots as he’s working downhill.  \nHenderson needs 1-2 quick steps to transition downhill on plays working the edge of the tackle box or just outside the \ntackle when he’s not using this method of flipping his hips and jump-stopping into a downhill position.  \nHe can lose his footing when attempting to work outside-inside off a jump stop. He must keep his inside foot wide enough \nto stabilize his movement to the inside or else he tips over. He must make a plant step with the inside foot that isn’t too far \nacross his frame to his outside shoulder. This happened with runs to either side of the field in 2022 when he was playing \nwith a broken bone in his foot that later required surgery.  \nEven with a healthy foot, Henderson uses footwork combinations that leave him off balance or cutting from a base robbed of \nits power. This happens between the tackles. He’s better in the open field. These behaviors make him less efficient between \nthe tackles than he could be.  \nIn 2021, Henderson didn’t bring his plant foot as far to the outside shoulder and his cuts and transitions had a stable base \nof operation.  \nHenderson can get his feet and knees high in traffic to step over fallen blockers or defenders. He’ll kick his heels through \nbackside reaches to his feet so he can maintain balance through the contact.  \nHenderson points the toe and opens his hips for efficient bounces to the edge. He pairs a stutter with a spin to work inside \nflat defenders pursuing from over the top. As a freshman, he has some moments of heel-clicking when sliding laterally \nacross gaps when behind the line of scrimmage. \nIn the open field, Henderson has an effective double up with the outside foot as he’s sprinting up the boundary. He uses this \nto freeze defensive backs over the top and dips inside without losing much speed.  \nAcceleration: Henderson can turn the corner on defensive backs – far-side or near-side.  \nSpeed: Henderson has the long speed to work past a deep safety when he earns a downhill crease untouched through the \nbox and into the secondary.  \nPower: Henderson’s stiff-arm is active enough to swat through the reach of defensive tackles as he works through a \ncrease. He’s often lacking the position of his feet and pads to move his feet after he’s wrapped high or low.  \nHenderson can pull through the lower-body wrap of a defensive end. He’ll accelerate through the lower-body contact with \nhis pads down. He’ll initiate contact with defenders (see if it’s only smaller ones) to finish runs.  \n\n \n76 \nAt the first level, he doesn’t push piles or drag defenders for significant distance after wrapped. He can drag an off-ball \nlinebacker and defensive back for 2-4 yards when hit at the second level. He finishes with good pad level.   \nDirect Contact Balance: Henderson can knock over a linebacker meeting him flat-footed in the hole when Henderson \ndrops his pads and has the momentum advantage. He’ll get a small push or stalemate with a linebacker who meets him in \nthe hole and both players have downhill momentum. He’ll force a safety backward in the hole when both parties have \nmomentum into the contact.   \nIndirect Contact Balance: Henderson can bounce off hard indirect contact to his pads from a safety. He will initiate \ncontact with a linebacker shooting a gap in the box and drop the pads into the opponent, forcing the defender to slide down \nHenderson’s frame to wrap up. He can push the defender backward with his collision.  \nHenderson can take a glancing shot to the side from a defensive end can continue downhill—at least as he’s extending \nforward at the end of a run. He’ll drop his pads into a blocked defensive tackle’s shoulder and run through the contact to \npush the defender on his back in a tight or non-existent crease.  \nRoutes: Henderson will identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and settle into the open area. He can follow \nthrough and present a friendly target better than he does. He has a three-quick release at the top of his stem on a circle \nroute.  \nReceiving: Henderson can turn behind his break path and use underhand position to catch the ball at his numbers, \nretracting the ball to his frame. He could have made these catches earlier with overhand position. This is also true of targets \nhe catches into his frame with underhand position that arrive over his shoulder on wide routes. This is a lapse with targets \narriving at shoulder height and he has missed targets because of it.  \nHenderson has shown that he can use overhand position to attack wide routes at the earliest point of the target’s point of \narrival. He can also turn behind his break path on a wide route to address the ball with overhand position at his back \nshoulder.  \nHe’s aware of the boundary and can get one foot inbounds when attacking a target over his shoulder. He can catch the ball \naway from his frame.  \nBlocking: Henderson identifies interior pressure, slides into the gap deep enough to square the opponent and shoot his \nhands into the chest of the defender. His hands can be tight enough to strike inside the opponent’s shoulders and he begins \nthe strike with his elbows bent. He can stone linebackers with his strikes – even if they aren’t technically sound (see below).  \nHenderson overextends into his strikes and jabs with his arms rather than using an uppercut motion that would allow him to \nactivate his lower body into the strike. Henderson will also clap his hands onto the defender as another method of attack \nrather than an uppercut. \nHe either overextends or catches contact and gets pushed into the pocket.  \nHenderson also identifies edge pressure outside the tackle box. He’s patient enough to allow the defender to declare a path \nbefore adjusting outside or inside to square the opponent without risk of the opponent having time to redirect.  \nHe’s effective at sliding with pressure arriving from the second and third levels of the defense that begin inside and loop \noutside as they reach the tackle box. Henderson also identifies T-E twists and steps up in the box to attack the twisting end \nwith help from his teammate.  \nHenderson will deliver a chip to the defensive end while leaking from the backfield. The chip is hard enough to slow the path \nof the opponent without dislodging the opponent from Henderson’s teammate. There are hits where he knocks a tackle to \nthe ground.   \nHenderson times his cut blocks effectively against edge pressure. He shoots through and across his target with enough \nheight to drop the opponent at the collision point. He drops his head and doesn’t see what he hits, making much of the \ncontact with the backs of his shoulders.  \nHenderson is an effective lead blocker against cornerbacks. He closes the gap, keeps his hands tight into the strike, aims for \nthe chest, and runs through the opponent. He takes the opponent to the ground.  \n\n \n77 \nBall Security: Henderson carries the ball under his sideline arm high to his chest. The elbow is often tight to his side when \nworking through traffic. He can take a hit to the ball-carrying arm or the ball.  \nHe has 676 career touches in 4 years with 2 fumbles – 1 per 338 touches. He hasn’t experienced a fumble for two years – \nthe last 354 touches.  \nDurability: Henderson suffered a broken bone in foot in third game of 2022 that required surgery. He tried playing through \nit and tweaked the injury in every game that he played.   \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you’re seeking a bell-cow, pass on Henderson. Trade down if you can, because \nHenderson’s value is usually among the top 2-3 backs in this class and the valuation of his class is likely at its peak right \nnow. Many of the top backs will likely still be available in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. \n \nAs mentioned at the top of the chapter, this is a good class, but the strength of it is getting compared to 2017’s crop of \nbacks. It’s unlikely we’ll see that manifest. Henderson is a high-end complement with RB2 upside as the realistic projection.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2022 Highlights \n• \nGame mismanagement in the red zone \n• \nOverextension pass pro \n• \nCutback on gap play for breakaway run \n• \nOpen-field vision, creativity, and speed \n• \nBreakaway speed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n78",

This reflects his potential as a high-impact contributor, but also acknowledges that he's more likely to be a complementary back rather than a true workhorse like Irons.  The Swift/McKinnon comparison points to his potential as an explosive, versatile back capable of contributing both running and receiving.  He lacks the consistent power and between-the-tackles ability to be compared to a true bell-cow back like Alvin Kamara or Christian McCaffrey.\n"

He must learn to press deeper with zone plays, but he has a lot \nof film where he has shown skill with setting up blocks effectively.  \nSampson is a promising pass protector who has improved his positioning and strikes. His attack as a pass-catcher has flaws \nhe must address despite proving he can make plays against contact and be an asset as a check-down receiver at the college \nlevel.  \nThe biggest concern is Sampson’s ball security. His overall rate is passable, but improvable. Sampson’s biggest workload \ncame in 2024 and it was his worst security rate – a rate on the cusp of falling below the RSP’s baseline for success. You’ll \nlearn more about this in Jaydon Blue’s report and the data that suggests there’s a baseline.  \nIf Sampson tightens up his work with zone plays, pass protection, catching the ball, and ball security, he could become a \nstarter capable of top 12 production in any given year. If Sampson only improves the ball security, he still has top-24 \npotential as a lead back in an offense.  \nWhere has the player improved? Against linebackers, Sampson is curtailing that overextension and sliding to close the \ngap before delivering tight hands. While he missed some assignments against a Georgia defense that brought pro-level blitz \npackages, he’s a promising pass protector.  \nVision: Sampson sets up pullers on gap plays. He reads leverage that will wreck the design and access the cutback. He also \nfinds cutbacks in the primary hole.  \nTennessee ran so many gap plays that Sampson doesn’t press his blockers on zone plays as deep as he does with gap \nplays. It opens him to getting wrapped as he works through a larger-looking crease. A press would have manipulated the \ndefender that ultimately tackled him and it can be the difference between a moderate gain and a large gain. Even so, \nSampson has shown he can press inside to set up a double team to the outside and then split the double team on the \ncutback and get into open space.  \nSampson identifies penetration developing at the line based on leverage and accelerates to the edge to get past the interior \ndefender. He’s also a confident tight crease runner in every area of the field. He’s creative and/or efficient in the open field \nbased on the pursuit.  \nHe manages down-and-distance and field position situations well—not taking unnecessary risks with cutbacks and bounces. \nInstead, he’ll take what’s in front of him to prevent losses that can close the playbook in these areas of the field.  \n\n \n79 \nElusiveness: Sampson sets up pullers with pace and stride variation upon approach. He varies his stride and pacing in the \nopen field to set up pursuit coming from over the top.  \nHe uses a spin to attempt to work free of reaches and wraps after the initial contact. He has a capable jump cut with a step \nof an unblocked box defender over the top of him.  \nSampson can transition outside from a downhill approach with the point of the toe to the boundary and opening his hips.  \nWhen Sampson identifies interior penetration meeting him at the exchange point, he can drop his weight into a quick two-\nstep stop and create a low center of gravity that helps him spin out of a wrap from a defensive end. He can reduce his \nshoulder from the reach of the defender and pull through a wrap to his waist.  \nSampson can pull away the leg that a defender targets with a shot while Sampson is in full stride.  \nSampson uses two small transition steps to get downhill after working to the opposite hash. He can reverse field and \ntransition downhill with a jump stop to get downhill that’s one step.  \nAcceleration: He can beat safeties to the near or far sideline and extend his lead to flip the field. He can accelerate past \nnear-side corners downfield with an angle on him after coming off a block.  \nSpeed: Sampson can at least extend his lead against safeties and some near-side corners. He can split safeties and corners \nup the middle.  \nPower: Sampson runs through reaches to his pads and torso from defensive tackles in the crease. He counters hits with a \nquick jab of a stiff arm to shove the defender off his frame.  \nHe pulls through wraps to his knees and lower legs from linebackers in the crease. He gets his feet high and through the \ndefender’s grasp once he feels it.  \nBetween the tackles, Sampson has low pad level and can work under the torso of a defensive tackle to earn yards in the \noccupied crease.  \nHe moves his feet so well that when he’s wrapped in the box, he gets yards or stays upright for teammates to join the pile \nand generate a push.  \nSampson’s stiff arm has the reach to ward off defensive ends shooting for his frame in the backfield. He also uses it as a \nwell-timed jab to knock defensive backs away from him.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Sampson can bounce off a linebacker’s shot to his pads and chest. Between the tackles, \nSampson’s low pad level that gets him into the hips and thighs of a defensive tackle can take the defender off his feet and \ngenerate a small push.  \nHe can stalemate a defensive tackle at the entrance of a hole with his pads hitting the defender’s chest.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Sampson can bounce off glancing shots to his chest and shoulder from a linebacker working \nacross his path. He can bounce off a hit to his side from a safety from backside pursuit as Sampson runs downhill. He can \nstalemate a defensive tackle’s glancing shot to his pads and stay on his feet for help to arrive.  \nSampson has an excellent balance-touch to work through wraps.  \nRoutes: Sampson identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly \nposition to the quarterback.  \nAs a slot receiver, Sampson has an effective double up at the top of his stem against off coverage. He counters the double \nup with a wipe as he executes a speed break. His speed break has flat drive and line steps on shallow routes.  \nReceiving: Sampson is prone to clap-attack short-range targets facing the quarterback where he uses overhand attack. His \noverhand attack is too wide and his hands clap onto either side of the ball. The same is true with underhand attack below \nthe knees and away from his frame. Overall, Sampson must tighten his hands at the point of attack.  \nSampson will catch and pierce downhill. He can take a hit to his chest as he catches and pierces while securing the target.  \n\n \n80 \nSampson adjusts to the ball while airborne to high-point. He can take a hit to the chest as he turns through the catch. He \ncan take a hit in the back from a linebacker he’s running toward while looking the ball into his hands.  \nBlocking: Sampson identifies the T-E twist. He’ll slide outside to handle the DT with a squat and square stance. He \noverextends into the contact but his hands are tight and he delivers a shot. Against linebackers, Sampson is curtailing that \noverextension and sliding to close the gap before delivering tight hands.  \nAlthough the defender’s strength/size advantage generates a push against the RB, Sampson adjust his hands and fights to \nget his hands onto the defender’s frame while moving his feet with the defender to remain square after the contact.  \nSampson identifies his assignments when there’s A-Gap pressure with a cross blitz of defensive backs behind it. He will \nassist with good position on a double-team of the A-Gap before peeling off late to shield the delayed cross-blitzing safety. \nHe also peels off a successful strike on an A-Gap LB and take the delayed safety blitz when they are solo assignments \nwithout a double-team component.  \nWhen there are two blitzers to the same side and he’s forced to choose, he has chosen the outside man when he should \ntake the inside man.  \nHe can layout a defensive end slanting inside an edge protector who reaches the pocket. Sampson’s tight hands, timing, \nand strike to the chest has pop. He’ll slide into the opposite A Gap, square a defensive tackle, and deliver his hands tight \ninto the chest of the defender and from a square stance. He overextends, but keeps his head up so he’s delivering a punch \nwith force.  \nHe can adjust to a defensive end sliding inside and redirect him around the quarterback with good positioning of his feet and \nhands.  \nBall Security: Sampson carries the ball high to his frame. His elbow is loose from his side but not wide of it.  \nSampson has 5 fumbles in 464 touches in three years – 1 per 92.8 touches. However, his year of highest workload was \n2024 and he had 4 of those fumbles in 279 touches, which is 1 per 69.75 touches.  \nAlthough his fumble rate was high in 2024, he still displayed an ability to hang onto the ball when defenders pulled at his \narm.  \nDurability: Hamstring injury hampered him in November and December. He suffered the initial injury in the season finale \nand aggravated it in December in a College Football Playoff game against Ohio State.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Sampson is a bargain after the first half of the second round. You might get that, too, \nespecially when the NFL Draft renders low draft capital for many of these backs.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMitigating Loss: ID’s penetration, deceleration/weight-drop, flips hips, balance-touch \n• \nBlocking a DT in A-Gap \n• \nReverses field and efficient one-step transition downhill \n• \nPresses inside to set up split of double team, speed to split secondary \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nCareer Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n81",
        "analysis": "## Dylan Sampson: NFL Draft Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:** Sampson possesses excellent elusiveness, utilizing a variety of moves (spin moves, jump cuts, effective footwork) to avoid tackles and create yards after contact.  He shows impressive balance and can break tackles at all levels of the field.\n* **Vision and Patience:**  He displays good vision, reading blocks effectively, particularly on gap plays.  He's patient in finding creases and displays a good feel for setting up blocks.\n* **Three-Down Potential:** While primarily a gap runner, he has shown the potential to be an every-down back.

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB8 \nJersey: No. 4 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/219 School: Arizona St. / Sacramento State \nComparison Spectrum: David Montgomery - Onterrio Smith/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 84.3 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \nSkattebo is on the cusp of Starter: Starting immediately with large role and learning on the go. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTexas Tech ‘24 \n• \nCincinnati ‘24 \n• \nKansas State ‘24 \n• \nTexas ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: It’s poetic that Skattebo’s player comps are David Montgomery and Onterrio Smith. Both are excellent \nmovers in traffic with the power and contact balance to work through contact and handle a large workload.  \nMontgomery is the standard on this continuum. Smith could have been the standard, if he didn’t get busted for using a \nprosthetic penis to hold someone else’s urine to cheat on NFL drug tests. Or, in language of the accountable … if Smith \ndidn’t smoke pot.  \nIf you blended the game of the Eagle Scout, Montgomery, with the frat-guy-gone-wrong in Smith, you get Bizarro \nMontgomery. That might be Cam Skattebo. There’s no denying Skattebo can run the football. There are some questions \nabout Skattebo’s maturity. I can’t tell you whether they are major or minor. I can only tell you for a fact what I see on the \nfield. \nSkattebo doesn’t know his athletic limitations as a game manager and athlete. Sometimes this spawns terrific efforts on film \nwith his balance, agility, determination, and strength. However, the gravity of the failures costs his team drives. Skattebo \nleads so far forward with his head as a pass protector, he’s a concussion in waiting, much less a liability against savvy and \nathletic NFL pass rushers.  \nWhile the Johnny Manziel, Partying Frat Boy Archetype may not be an accurate label for Skattebo, there is private \ncommentary among football people suggesting as much. These are rumors and rumors in the NFL are nasty business.  \nBefore going any further, understand that nothing about Skattebo’s potential history of immaturity has any impact on the \nRSP’s evaluation. What happens on the field is the only thing that factors into a player’s grade and ranking.  \nIt’s why Jermaine Burton earned strong marks in last year’s publication. In Burton’s case, the rumors about him played out \nduring his rookie year in Cincinnati. Dan Marino suffered through rumors of cocaine use and his draft capital plummeted \nrelative to his talent.  \nIs it possible any whispers about Skattebo are bad rumors from scouts who have little savvy about investigating and \ninterviewing players? Absolutely, there’s a wide variance of skill, life experience, maturity, and knowledge among scouts.  \nMy recommendation: Until there’s documented reports legitimizing rumors of problematic immaturity – not typical college \nkid immaturity – give Skattebo’s report full value. If there’s substantial information that comes out about Skattebo, \nreconsider at that time. \nYou can read the details below that make Skattebo a promising B-Back who can earn starter production, even when paired \nwith a dynamic A-Back. Just keep in mind that the Riggins and Manzel aspects of his personality, if true, could lead to an \nimplosion.  \nTechnical: Skattebo’s passing prowess has been a regular weapon in the RB option game. He has enough range and \naccuracy to lead receivers into open zones on passes 25-30 yards downfield.  \nVision: Skattebo identifies interior penetration and adjusts to the adjacent crease. He’ll press toward the penetration—\nwithin two steps—before taking the cutback.  \n\n \n82 \nSkattebo must learn his athletic limitations with cutbacks off a long perimeter runway. He costs himself yardage. Between \nthe tackles, Skattebo is a tight-crease runner who will drop the pads and keep his feet moving to finish.  \nSkattebo will press within a step of his puller on a gap play and when the crease is plugged, he can find the cutback. On \nperimeter runs, Skattebo presses inside and gets within a step of his linemen before bouncing it outside the tackle box.  \nIn short-yardage down and distance situations, Skattebo is wise about attacking tight creases or soft spots rather than \nattempting bounces or cutbacks.  \nElusiveness: Skattebo uses the spin to work through contact in the box. He has small jump cuts away from interior \npenetration from box defenders. Skattebo points his toe to open his hips in the box and begin an efficient bounce outside.  \nHe uses a jump stop to set up cutbacks near the line of scrimmage. He can transition out of a jump stop with a flip of his \nhips.  \nSkattebo can get his feet over fallen defenders in the crease. Skattebo adjusts stride length and pacing behind the line of \nscrimmage to set up blocks.  \nSkattebo has curvilinear speed to work to the opposite hash and turn the corner up the hash and inside a force defender. He \nonly needs one transition step to turn the short corner after acceleration past penetration into the backfield. After that two-\nstep transition, Skattebo can deliver consecutive jump cuts to work back inside against pursuit.  \nOn Toss to the short side flat, Skattebo only needs two transition steps to get downhill. Skattebo can decelerate near the \nline of scrimmage or in the crease with 1-2 steps. He can also drop his weight to set up a spin or jump cut.  \nAcceleration: Skattebo can accelerate past outside linebackers and cornerbacks to the far-sideline. He’ll turn the corner \nbefore the cornerback catches him downfield. He can do the same with a cornerback to the short edge when he presses \ndeep enough to force the cornerback out of ideal position.  \nSpeed: He can beat linebackers to the edge. His acceleration is the best phase for him to beat defensive backs.  \nPower: Skattebo pulls through reaches to his upper body from defensive tackles and linebackers. He can bounce off \nmultiple hits from a linebacker and/or defensive backs. Skattebo also drops his pads deep enough to get under hits from \nlinebackers in compressed space.  \nSkattebo uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches or brace himself against pursuit to set up a spin away from the defender. He \ndoes this in open space and between the tackles.  \nSkattebo wards off some of the impact of hits to his frame with a stiff arm. He can transition from a stiff arm to a balance-\ntouch after the contact impedes his balance. His best use of the stiff arm is to swat down on the arms rather than as an \nextending tool to ward off contact.  \nHe has difficulty landing the stiff arm when attacking defenders in pursuit as he works around the edge. He tends to shoot it \ntoo high and over the head of the defender.  \nSkattebo’s forearm shiver is a different story. He lands it with force and knocks defenders to the ground with it.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Skattebo can stalemate a defensive tackle, forcing the tackle to wrap up. He can bounce off a hit \nfrom a linebacker in the crease or knock the defender on his back and continue through.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Skattebo can take a hard shot to his thigh from a cornerback and run through it. He can deliver \na forearm shiver on a defensive back coming down the line and send the defender off-balance.  \nSkattebo can take a glancing shot with force from a defensive end penetrating into the backfield and hitting Skattebo in the \nside, pads, and thighs. Skattebo can bounce off it and continue forward, taking another hit and getting a push against a \nlinebacker and/or defensive back.  \nRoutes: Skattebo identifies second-level defenders, works to depth, and settles into the open area to present a friendly \ntarget to the quarterback. When he doesn’t earn a target, Skattebo works downfield to find an open area on the scramble \ndrill for his quarterback. \n\n \n83 \nWhen working between zone defenders in the vertical game, Skattebo tempos his breaks and doesn’t show his eyes until he \nhas crossed the buzz/rollover defender. Skattebo uses his tempo change to set up an inset for a double move up the \nboundary.  \nHe can play with pace during his stems on hitches and stop routes—accelerating dramatically at the top of his stems and \ninto his breaks.  \nReceiving: Skattebo can turn to his back hip on a wide route and catch the ball with underhand or overhand attack. He \ntracks the ball over his shoulder with flat routes. He can extend one hand high and away from his frame to snare a target \ndownfield of his boundary-side shoulder.  \nHe uses overhand position for targets at helmet level, but leaves his feet unnecessarily. He can attack the ball at the \nearliest window. He can take a wrap to the back or chest as he secures a target.  \nSkattebo tracks the ball over his shoulder and he can handle a bump from the defender before attacking the ball. He \ndisplays late hands with vertical targets against tight coverage.  \nSkattebo will catch and pierce. He also obeys the ball to extend downhill and stretch the ball to the pylon.  \nBlocking: As a lead blocker, Skattebo overextends into his assignments. When he drops his head and leans headfirst into \nthe opponent, the defender can counter and get inside or outside Skattebo untouched.  \nSkattebo recognizes A-Gap pressure and delivers a timely cut block that works across and through the opponent’s frame \nwith good height. He drops his head as he shoots across the target. When there’s a threat of a linebacker wide of the tackle \nbox, that defender can distract him from sliding to the A-Gap and he misses the assignment.  \nHe recognizes late safety pressure to attack against a pressure package to his side of the line but he overextends without \nextending his arms. He’s prone to leading with his head without his arms as a blocker and misses his assignments.  \nSkattebo can earn a square and squat position when helping an interior lineman with a double team. His elbows are bent \nand he aims for the chest, but he doesn’t deliver a strike. Instead, Skattebo shields the defender without striking.  \nOn the rare occasion he delivers an uppercut, his head is too far forward and the helmet hits the defender before his hands \nhave a chance. This gives the opponent the first strike and ability to push.  \nBall Security: Skattebo has 9 fumbles in 848 career touches over 4 seasons – 1 lost per 94.2 touches. He had 3 fumbles in \n340 touches in 2024 – 1 per 113.33 touches.  \nSkattebo carries the ball high to his frame with the boundary-side arm, but the elbow is loose from his frame. The ball gets \nwide from his side as he changes direction between the tackles. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm.  \nDurability: No significant injuries. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you have a good team with running back depth, Skattebo is the best player available, \nand you can’t trade the pick away for more picks or later picks, go ahead and gamble. Purely as a football player, Skattebo \ncan become an RB2 with peak seasons as an RB1.  \n \nIf you’re trying to avoid off-field gambles, stay away from Skattebo. Even if he works out for a year or two, you’re trying to \nbuild with talent you can rely on when every pick is a gamble. Why add the wildcard of a potentially self-destructive \npersonality to the mix?  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nIDs leverage for bounce, opens hips, accelerates past OLB, builds speed past DB, feet high \n• \nAttempt to cut back on bounce to far side but needs four transition steps – too much \n• \nRed zone: Cutback on gap play, jump stop, hip flip, pad level \n• \nToss: Two-step transition to short-side flat, consecutive jump cuts, drops pads to finish \n• \nOverextension with pass protection is rampant \n• \nThe Cam Skattebo Headbutt \n• \nCam Skattebo Headbutt III \n• \n2024 Highlights \n\n \n84",
        "analysis": "**Cam Skattebo**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power and Contact Balance:**  Exceptional ability to run through contact, showing impressive power and balance to break tackles and maintain forward momentum.  This is his most significant asset.\n* **Elusiveness:** Skilled at using jump cuts, spins, and changes of pace to evade tacklers, especially effective in tight spaces.\n* **Acceleration and Speed:** Possesses impressive acceleration, allowing him to quickly gain separation from defenders, particularly on the perimeter.  He's capable of beating linebackers and cornerbacks to the edge.\n* **Passing Ability:** Shows surprising ability as a passer in option plays, with enough accuracy and range to hit receivers downfield.\n* **Vision:**  Good at identifying creases and adjusting his runs effectively, particularly between the tackles.  He reads penetration well.\n* **Short-Yardage Prowess:** Demonstrates a sound understanding of attacking tight creases effectively in short-yardage situations.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Become a Starting-Caliber RB:** His raw talent and physical abilities suggest he has the potential to become a feature back in the NFL.\n* **Improve Pass Protection:**  This is his biggest weakness.  Addressing his tendency to lead with his head and overextend could dramatically increase his value.\n* **Refine Run Decision-Making:** While his vision is good, he sometimes makes poor decisions on perimeter runs, costing himself yardage. Improving his awareness of his athletic limitations would elevate his game.\n* **Improve Receiving Consistency:** While capable, refinement of his receiving technique (specifically hand placement and unnecessary leaving of feet) could make him a more reliable pass-catching back.\n* **Address Off-Field Concerns:** The report mentions rumors about immaturity and potential off-field issues. Addressing these concerns would greatly improve his draft stock and overall NFL prospects.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Pass Protection:** A significant liability due to his tendency to lead with his head, creating a high risk of concussion and ineffective blocking.\n* **Run Decision-Making (Perimeter):**  Makes poor choices on perimeter runs, leading to wasted yardage.  Needs to better assess his options before committing to a cutback.\n* **Ball Security:** While not excessively high, his fumble rate is a concern that needs to be addressed.\n* **Blocking Technique:** While possessing some ability, his blocking technique is inconsistent and often ineffective due to overextension and leading with his head.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **David Montgomery:** This is the higher-end comparison, reflecting Skattebo's power running style and ability to run between the tackles.  Montgomery's success is a potential ceiling for Skattebo.\n* **Onterrio Smith:** This comparison highlights the risk/reward aspect of Skattebo's profile. Smith had significant talent, but his off-field issues severely limited his career.  This comparison underscores the potential for both immense success and catastrophic failure for Skattebo.  The report cautions this is a comparison based on playing style and not character.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nSkattebo is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His physical talent is undeniable, making him a potential RB2 with flashes of RB1 potential. However, his weaknesses in pass protection and decision-making, coupled with off-field concerns, make him a risky pick. Teams selecting him will need to weigh his immense potential against the considerable risk involved.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB9 \nJersey: No.2 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/224 School: Iowa \nComparison Spectrum: Todd Gurley - Joe Mixon - X - Latavius Murray \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.8 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nIowa State ‘24 \n• \nOhio State ‘24 \n• \nWashington ‘24 \n• \nMichigan State ‘24 \n• \nWisconsin ‘24 \n• \nUCLA ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Seeking a wide zone runner that a team can plug-and-play immediately and get starter production? \nJohnson is that back in this draft.  \nJohnson is not the best all-around runner in the class, but he’s one of the strongest fits for this specific blocking scheme. \nJohnson can run other blocking schemes. He sets up linebackers effectively on Counter. He presses unblocked defenders \ninto blockers on Duo, and he’s judicious about working behind the correct hip of his pullers based on the play’s \ndevelopment.  \nIt’s outside zone that sets the stage for a lot of the things Johnson does well as a runner. He sees the second level of the \ndefense and sets up crams, bounces, and cutbacks in ways where he can crease the first wave of defenders and time \ncutbacks at the second and third levels that lead to long gains.  \nIn addition to setting up slower-developing cutbacks, Johnson finds quick cutbacks based on pre-snap information. He has \noccasional lapses where he bounces plays outside too early when there were better indications for him to stick with the play \ndesign.  \nOverall, Johnson manages the game well as a ball carrier. He takes what’s available to him in situations where bigger risks \naren’t appropriate for the black zone or red zone. This may explain away some of the criticism that Johnson’s game is built \non big plays and a bunch of ineffective plays.  \nJohnson’s feet work in conjunction with his eyes. He’s efficient with his adjustments to set up blocks or to defeat unblocked \ndefenders one-on-one. Johnson can be efficient or dynamic with his footwork.  \nOnce he earns space, Johnson’s acceleration and speed are explosive enough for starter-caliber work in the NFL – especially \nin a zone scheme. He challenges or beats defensive backs when he has cleared the initial runway and his acceleration is \ngood enough to get past linebackers and box safeties on that runway.  \nHe’s not a scatback with excellent deceleration and re-acceleration, but his change of direction style fits the type of lanes \nthat wide zone opens – one cut and downhill and several yards later, another cut and downhill if he’s in the open field.  \nJohnson runs with a good forward lean between the tackles, falling forward when wrapped. Johnson pulls through reaches \nfrom defensive linemen when he has downhill momentum into the crease. He can carry a defensive tackle 3-5 yards \ndownfield when wrapped at his back.  \nJohnson uses the stiff-arm to swat away reaches for his frame as he executes a cutback. He has good reach with his stiff \narm to ward off reaches in the secondary. His forearm shiver is effective for initiating contact and discarding defenders after \nthe collision.  \nJohnson keeps his feet moving when wrapped high and can stay upright so teammates can rally to him. He will bounce off \nmultiple glancing shots and pull through reaches and some wraps during the same carry.  \n\n \n85 \nMany of his attempts end with gang tackling, and he wins collisions in the process. Johnson has the size and balance to win \nagainst all three levels of defenders when accounting for the momentum into the collision and the angle of the collision. \nMost of his success will come in the secondary and occasional with linebackers, but he has bounced off glancing shots from \ndefensive linemen.  \nJohnson has good enough hands as an outlet receiver. When forced to extend low or wide of his frame, Johnson’s hands get \nwide and he’s prone to clap-attacking targets and fighting the ball.  \nJohnson’s pass protection is a weak part of his game. He misdiagnoses blitzes when the defenders applying the pressure \naren’t in the box pre-snap – slot blitzes, corner blitzes, and disguised safety blitzes.  \nJohnson is also guilty of dropping his head into contact and giving up the first strike. Defenders can dictate terms against \nhim.  \nJohnson can become a regular part of a rushing offense as a rookie and potentially serve as the lead back. The offense \nmight be better off this year with a passing-down back to spell Johnson late in halves and when the game scrip calls for \nheavy passing. I don’t see a scenario where Johnson earns more than 45 catches in most seasons – and might not earn \nmore than 30 in most years as a starter.  \nExpect Johnson to tighten his attack of the ball and improve his blitz reads. Blocking technique might take more time and \nprove difficult for him to fully address his attack.  \nIf this is the case, Johnson might become a two-down back in the NFL where his best-case scenario for strong production is \nrushing yards and rushing touchdowns in a run-heavy offense.  \nVision: Johnson reads leverage crossing the face of a defender into the crease and makes adjustments as necessary. He \nreads penetration into the backfield and adjusts away from the pursuit when he has 2-3 steps to adjust. Penetration up the \nmiddle and within a step of him during the exchange leads to a loss.  \nWhen the penetration is a push, he can initially read the leverage, adjust away from it, and make a second adjustment \nwhen the leverage changes. Johnson adjusts well to edge and interior penetration, taking what the defense gives him—\nespecially in his black zone.  \nJohnson sets up wind back blocks and hits the crease decisively afterward. He’s decisive with off-tackle zone, including \nfinding cutbacks soon after the exchange. He’ll press within 2-3 steps and bend to the cutback lane.  \nJohnson presses the inside crease on perimeter runs to set up a block and gain the edge. He takes what’s available to him \nand is mindful of red zone and black zone management.  \nJohnson sets up linebackers on Counter and can hit the cutback lane when the linebacker over pursues. Johnson presses \nwithin a step of his blockers or unblocked defender on Duo, opens his hips, and accesses the cutback lane. He attacks that \ncutback lane decisively and with good acceleration.  \nHe’s skilled at working behind the correct hip of either puller based on the play development to best access a rushing lane. \nJohnson is judicious with his identification and accuracy with hitting cutback lanes on gap plays. \nWhen running outside zone, Johnson identifies the backside linebacker working down the line and Johnson can hit his front \nside crease and make a timely cutback on the backside pursuit to earn another 7-10 yards on the play.  \nThere are some inside zone plays where Johnson bounces the play outside when he had much better reasons to stay inside \nand ride the double team.  \nElusiveness: Johnson adjusts his stride length to set up his blocks. He opens his hips with the point of the toe to bounce \noutside pursuit coming downhill for him. He can even open the toe of the inside foot and flip his hips before pointing the toe \nof the outside foot.  \nJohnson has effective jump stops and he gets his feet up against traffic when working between the tackles. He can jump cut \naway from penetration shooting interior gaps. He’ll spin through reaches and wraps.  \nWhen transitioning downhill off Toss to the short-side perimeter, Johnson only needs two quick steps to get downhill. The \nsame is true with off-tackle runs without a toss. He’s fluid with his feet when transitioning.  \n\n \n86 \nJohnson has an effective stick to set up a collision with a linebacker and leave the defender on the ground.  \nAcceleration: Johnson has the acceleration to beat linebackers working inside out to the short-side boundary. When \ncorners and safeties are out of position early, Johnson can reach the secondary and beat them up the boundary. He can \naccelerate past the far-side safety on Toss.  \nJohnson also accelerates past the same-side cornerback on a cutback from off-tackle zone.  \nSpeed: On Toss to the short-side perimeter, Johnson can extend a run for 30 yards against a pursuing safety from the \nsame side of the field. He can beat the opposite-side safety on Toss to the short-side perimeter.  \nHe’ll force an opposite-side corner to chase him down in the open field, but extend the play 35-45 yards. When he gets to \nfull speed to the far-sideline he can hold off safeties and cornerbacks for 55-70 yards.  \nPower: Johnson runs with a good forward lean between the tackles, falling forward when wrapped. Johnson pulls through \nreaches from defensive linemen when he has downhill momentum into the crease. He can carry a defensive tackle 3-5 yards \ndownfield when wrapped at his back.  \nJohnson uses the stiff-arm to swat away reaches for his frame as he executes a cutback. He has good reach with his stiff \narm to ward off reaches in the secondary. His forearm shiver is effective for initiating contact and discarding defenders after \nthe collision.  \nJohnson keeps his feet moving when wrapped high and can stay upright so teammates can rally to him. He will bounce off \nmultiple glancing shots and pull through reaches and some wraps during the same carry. Many of his attempts end with \ngang tackling.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Johnson can stalemate or beat a direct collision with a linebacker in the open flat or in the hole \nwhen he has a short runway of momentum into the contact.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Johnson bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks as he works through the crease. He \ninitiates contact with linebackers in the second level and wins the collision to earn extra yardage, forcing the linebacker to \nwrap up. If he gets momentum through a crease into the second level he can bounce off a glancing shot from a linebacker. \nJohnson can stalemate a DE in the crease on a short yardage run downhill.  \nRoutes: Johnson identifies the second-level zone defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area while making a \nfriendly target to the quarterback.  \nReceiving: Johnson can extend behind his break and below the knees to catch the ball with underhand attack and at the \nearliest window.  \nJohnson transitions downhill with effective catch-and-pierce technique, gauging the leverage of pursuit that he can see as \nhe’s addressing the target. He obeys the location of the ball to determine the direction of his transition.  \nJohnson is prone to clap-attacking low targets with his arms extended from his frame.  \nJohnson uses overhand position to catch targets at the numbers. He’ll also high-point the ball over his head without leaving \nhis feet – a demonstration of good tracking when a player doesn’t have to leave his feet unnecessarily.  \nJohnson extends away from his frame with overhand position to make catches ahead of his break path while taking contact \nto his back. Johnson also extends over his shoulder for the ball with overhand position.  \nWhen forced to extend until his arms are straight on targets leading him downfield, Johnson can clap the back-shoulder \nhand onto the boundary hand and that clap-attack can lead to a drop.  \nBlocking: Johnson can miss wide nine edge pressure that he should help pick up. He also misses corner blitzes and slot \nblitzes that would be his to pick up. Johnson doesn’t take opportunities to chip-release when he should.  \nWhen Johnson identifies A-Gap pressure and cross-blitzing pressure when the alignment is in the box, he’ll work inside-out \nto get tight with his guard or center and square the defender with a squat position. He overextends and catches contact \nrather than delivers a punch. His arms are too wide to get inside. His position of his hands could lead to an uppercut punch \nbut he doesn’t throw it.  \n\n \n87 \nWhen the alignment of the linebackers is just deeper than the box, Johnson can miss the A-gap pressure that comes.  \nAlthough Johnson will catch contact from interior pressure, he will get his hands tight and inside and can move his feet to \nturn a defender away from the pocket. He must avoid lapses with his hand width and learn to punch.  \nJohnson slides outside to the B-Gap with good wide footwork and times cut blocks of linebackers effectively. He drops his \nhead and overextends, but he works across the frame of the opponent and shoots through the body. When he drops his \nhead and overextends, he shoots too low and tries to make up for it with his body shooting upward through the contact.  \nAgainst smaller defenders blitzing the edge (DBs)—Johnson earns a square and squat position and shuffles his feet well \nenough move laterally and shield them from the pocket.  \nBall Security: Johnson carries the ball under his left arm as his default position, but when encountering pursuit as he \nworks to the right side of the field, he’ll switch to his boundary-side arm. He carries the ball high to his chest, but his elbow \nis loose from his side. He can take hard shots to the ball-carrying arm and maintain possession of the ball.  \nJohnson has 552 career touches between 2022-2024 and 3 fumbles – 1 per 184 touches. His rate between 2022-2023: 1 \nper 165.67 touches. He hasn’t fumbled in the last 262 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: For months, almost every analyst and scout I’ve seen or spoken with has been matching \nJohnson to a wide zone offense. It means the NFL is unlikely to get this wrong. Expect Johnson to be a late pick in Day 2 or \nDay Three of the NFL Draft.  \n \nHe may never emerge as an RB1 if he can’t refine his passing-down chops, or the offensive line isn’t good. Still, you can \ndraft Johnson with confidence in the first 5-10 picks and bet on him delivering RB2-RB3 value within his first 2-3 seasons.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nManipulates LB into wind-back crease and contact balance \n• \nOutside zone toss with good cutback after reading leverage \n• \nRiding the wave \n• \nBig play and open-field creativity \n• \nPressing unblocked defender within a step on Duo and finding cutback \n• \nCutback in the crease: altering the axis of pursuit \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n88",
        "analysis": "Kaleb Johnson is a running back prospect projected as a rotational starter in the NFL, excelling in outside zone schemes.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Outside Zone Expertise:**  Johnson's primary strength lies in his ability to read and exploit outside zone blocking schemes. He effectively sets up cutbacks, creases, and utilizes pre-snap information to maximize yardage. His vision, footwork, and acceleration combine to create explosive plays in this scheme.\n* **Power and Balance:** Despite not being the biggest back, Johnson possesses surprising power, falling forward after contact and consistently dragging defenders.  He displays good balance, winning collisions against multiple defenders at all levels. His stiff arm and forearm shiver are effective tools to shed tacklers.\n* **Acceleration and Speed:**  Once he hits the second level, Johnson's acceleration and speed are noteworthy, enabling him to outrun linebackers and safeties. He can extend runs significantly in the open field.\n* **Pass-Catching Ability (Moderate):** Though not a primary receiving threat, he shows adequate hands and can be a serviceable outlet receiver, particularly in shorter routes.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Develop Pass Protection:**  This is a significant area for improvement.  His blitz recognition and technique need refinement to become a consistent three-down back.\n* **Refine Receiving Skills:** While pass-catching ability is adequate, improving his ball tracking and catching techniques, especially on low or wide throws, would enhance his overall value.\n* **Improve Consistency:** While effective in outside zone, occasionally he makes poor reads and bounces plays outside when staying inside would have been more advantageous. Consistent decision-making is key.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum (Todd Gurley, Joe Mixon, Latavius Murray) highlights different aspects of his game.  He shares Gurley's power and ability to break tackles, Mixon's ability to make cuts and gain yards after contact, and Murray's ability to run between the tackles (though his primary strength is outside zone). The lack of a definitive \"X\" comparison suggests he doesn't perfectly fit into a single established NFL archetype but offers a blend of skills from several successful backs.  His skillset leans more heavily towards a power back who excels in a zone-running scheme rather than a pure between-the-tackles runner or a receiving back.\n"

        "player_name": "Omarion Hampton",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB10 \nJersey: No.28 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/221 School: UNC  \nComparison Spectrum: X-Tyler Allgeier - - Jonathan Williams \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.7 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPitt ‘23 \n• \nGa. Tech ‘23 \n• \nClemson ‘23 \n• \nPitt ‘24 \n• \nFSU ‘24 \n• \nNC State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Hampton is a draftnik favorite. He’s a big back with good footwork who understands how to use his \nmovement to set up his primary assets of power and contact balance.  \nHampton is a good route runner who can win in the shallow zones against man-to-man and zone coverage. With the \nexception of some clap-attacking in specific situations, he’s a reliable receiver. There’s promise also with his pass protection.  \nWhat gets most of the public excited about Hampton is his size-speed combination. Hampton’s 4.48-second, 40-Yard Dash \ninspires them to believe Hampton is a special runner and athlete.  \nThere’s no doubt that he’s a good prospect, and he has the skills to become a contributor capable of substantial weekly \nproduction. There are details that his most ardent supporters are downplaying.  \nThe long speed is one of the biggest factors fueling the Hampton love fest. His performance at the NFL Combine supports \nthe idea he has borderline elite speed.  \nAt the same time, Hampton’s initial acceleration is Committee Tier on the cusp of Starter Tier. When watching his \nacceleration and speed on the field, the times make sense and support the story seen on tape: When Hampton earns a long \nand unfettered runway, his top-end speed can generate breakaway runs. However, Hampton’s acceleration isn’t good \nenough for him to earn the runway needed to build that speed as often as people might expect with that 40-Yard Dash \nmark.  \nTyler Allgeier is 0.12 seconds slower than Hampton, but he has generated field-flipping gains when he earns a runway. I \nwould also bet his initial acceleration is on par with Hampton’s.  \nThe problem is that many with high expectations for Hampton will be disappointed with mentioning him and Allgeier in the \nsame sentence when discussing explosion. This is not the only sticking point that may limit Hampton’s game a little more \nthan the current expectation.  \nHampton’s ball security is on the low-end of the baseline tier for what’s acceptable. As a big back with power and a \ndetermined running style, Hampton must improve his ball security or else it could limit his workload—no matter how \ntalented and skilled he may be elsewhere.  \nIf Hampton addresses ball security and pass protection, he could lead a committee. He’s a decisive runner with the \nversatility to run Duo, Inside Zone, Gap plays, and Off-Tackle Zone. He’s also a skilled player on Draw. He manages the \ngame well as a ball carrier, too.   \nHampton’s floor and ceiling are about a tier lower than the collective take that he’s a star in the making. Expect him to be a \nstarting-caliber B-Back in an offense that features a quick accelerator who wins in open space. If called upon to be the \nevery-down starter, Hampton can do it, but I suspect he won’t keep that job long-term.  \nVision: Hampton makes mature decisions based on down and distance and game script. He displays patience with gap \nplays, waiting for his pullers to earn position on their primary assignments before beginning his path to the crease.  \n\n \n89 \nHampton will press inside-out, working within 1-2 steps of a penetrating defender in the middle of the backfield before \nveering outside to his pullers. He’ll also find cutbacks a step from his blockers or pursuit.  \nHe’ll read penetration from the edge on an inside zone play and work tight to his lead blocks away from the penetrator, \nsetting up favorable leverage to get through the crease.  \nHampton can get skinny and work through tight creases with aggression. The same is true of working under hits with the tilt \nof the pads. He adjusts the pace and/or length of his stride to set up creases between the tackles. He attacks soft spots \nwhere creases will be closed in short yardage, but he knows he’s attacking a safety and has a better chance of pushing \nforward.  \nElusiveness: Hampton gets his knees and feet high when defenders shoot low. He’s not a sudden stop-start mover in the \nopen field. He can fool defenders one-on-one in the flat with a three-step juke to cut back to the inside when the defender \noverpursues.  \nHampton will use a spin to counter his collisions with a safety he meets downhill in the secondary. Hampton can transition \ndownhill from a perimeter approach with one step on a toss play. He needs two steps against the play-side cornerback to \nthe short-side boundary.  \nHampton can open his hips and work outside penetration into the backfield at the exchange point. He may not outrun the \ndefender, but he can avoid the hit at the exchange point and get downhill.  \nHampton delivers the double up with the inside foot with stride variation and suddenness to set up a pursuing LB to the \ninside so he can bounce outside his lead blocker.  \nHampton has a small jump cut to slide away from pursuit over the top in tight quarters.  \nAcceleration: Hampton has enough burst to beat an inside linebacker around the flat after the catch on a wide route, \nreaching the boundary. He can also beat a linebacker around the short-side corner on designed runs to the perimeter. He \ncan beat some play-side linebackers to the far-side corner and challenge a safety on a perimeter run.  \nHampton beats defensive linemen through creases up the middle. He beat some safeties and cornerbacks up the middle or \nthe far-side edge on a perimeter run. He can do at the near-side edge when the cornerback climbs 1-2 steps out of position.  \nSpeed: Hampton can defeat some angles of safeties in the open field with his speed and hold off safeties for over 40 yards. \nCornerbacks from the same side of the field can catch up and make contact within 35-40 yards. Cornerbacks from the \nopposite flat can catch Hampton at the far sideline within 30-35 yards. When the corner was at the opposite numbers or \nboundary, Hampton can extend the gain 60-70 yards.  \nWhen Hampton earns a big runway, he builds speed that can generate breakaway gains. That’s exciting, but it’s difficult to \ngenerate that kind of runway and his speed and acceleration in the early phases of a run will often prevent him from \nreaching that gear. His speed beyond 40 yards is better than his speed inside of 40 yards.  \nPower: Hampton uses a stiff-arm to initiate contact in tight spaces, warding off the reach of large defenders as he bounces \nor cuts back to a different hole. He’ll also use it around the perimeter with enough extension to keep a defender from \nreaching his frame. He has the accuracy and timing with his stiff arms to making all three levels of defender’s fail to wrap \nup and do so in succession.  \nHampton can pull through reaches to his upper body from defensive ends and defensive backs. When he generates \nmomentum downhill, he can pull a defensive end for 3-5 yards who wraps him high at the entrance of a crease. Hampton \nalso pulls through upper body wraps from defensive lineman as he’s working to the perimeter.  \nHampton will attack defenders with his pads, initiating contact in tight creases. He’ll generate a push against linebackers \nwrapping him high with a downhill angle. Hampton gets his knees and feet high enough to pull through wraps to his waist \nfrom linebackers in the crease.  \nDefenders at all three levels who wrap Hampton high will get taken for a ride downhill for 3-5 yards, if not more, depending \non the length of the runway for Hampton and the defender’s size.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Hampton can drop his pads into a defensive end meeting him with momentum in a tight crease \nand at least stalemate the interaction, if not generate a small push. Hampton can bounce off a hard direct hit in the hole \n\n \n90 \nfrom a defensive tackle when he’s the one with the momentum. He can spin off the hit and fall forward after earning 3-4 \nyards after the contact. He wins interactions with safeties when he meets them past the hole with downhill momentum in \nhis favor.  \nHowever, he must learn to attack one side of the defender in these scenarios and uses his pads with better timing so he \ndoesn’t hit them in the chest and with pad level that submarines him into to the turf when he should win the interaction.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Hampton will bounce off indirect collisions with safeties and linebackers. When he initiates the \ncollision with his pads he can defeat linebackers in the hole and push defensive ends forward.  \nRoutes: Hampton identifies the second-level zone defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He turns to the \nquarterback and creates a friendly target with these routes.  \nAgainst off-coverage, Hampton will run at the defender or dive the stem inside. He’ll also close the gap and deliver a stick \ninside to set up a break to the outside. He uses his head and eyes to sell the stick at the top of the stem. He also widens a \ndefender and use a two-quick with a shoulder reduction at the top of stems against off-man.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Hampton will work to the open space and present a friendly target for his \nquarterback.  \nAs an outside receiver, Hampton uses a double up with a wipe counter. The double up lacks any nuance of patience and \nsuddenness.  \nReceiving: Hampton attacks targets at chest and helmet level with overhand position and his hands away from his frame. \nHe tracks the ball effectively as it arrives over his shoulder and keeps his feet on the ground for targets at helmet level and \nabove. He can use underhand attack at the numbers.  \nHampton has good hand-eye coordination on wide routes, turning behind his break path at the last moment to use \noverhand position with one hand to snare an errant check-down. Hampton has lapses with clap-attacks with targets where \nhe extends his arms from his chest to attack the ball with overhand position.  \nHe can turn behind his break path and extend his arms fully to make catches of targets at helmet level while a defender in \ntight coverage wraps him. Hampton torques the ball away from the opponent. \nHampton obeys the ball and catches and pierces downhill. He doesn’t drop many passes. When he does, one issue can be \ndue to clap-trapping targets at the beltline.  \nBlocking: Hampton identifies A-, B-, and C-gap pressure and he’s patient with his position so he can force the defender \nwide of the pocket before delivering a strike with elbows bent. He has a good bend with his knees and takes the air out of \nthe interaction to deliver a tight strike with his hands. He can deliver an uppercut with a small amount of hip roll and follow \nup with a second punch.  \nWhen leaking from the pocket into zone coverage, Hampton will take one shoulder of a linebacker and chip with enough \nforce to slow the defender’s rush.  \nHampton reads his keys with linebackers but can come off the read a beat too early, missing a delayed twist or loop to the \ninside and leaks into the flat as a receiver when pass protection should be the priority. In the instances I’ve seen this, he \nmay be following the design of the play, but it would be worth looking into if there were access to speak with Hampton and \nhis staff about pass protections in these scenarios.  \nWhen running a lead draw as the lead blocker, Hampton will miss a cornerback blitz from the backside that he has time to \nidentify and act on. Instead, he will work downhill. When the blitz gets into the backfield fast, it might be wiser for him to \ncut off that threat instead.  \nHampton can work across the pocket and deliver a strike to a defensive tackle. He’ll rush his process to the point that he \nstrikes from an off-balance position. The strike with his size behind it is enough to slow the defender, but without \nestablishing position, he bounces off the defender and out of position to deliver a second strike.  \nHampton does a good job working outside-in, beginning with a double-team on the edge and then working inside when he \nspots a linebacker blitz. He can slide back to the inside and force the opponent away from the pocket with a timely strike.  \n\n \n91 \nHampton also works effectively from the inside-out to attack a late-blitzing safety after monitoring the linebacker’s progress \nin the A-Gap. He can be late to identify the Green Dawg and miss the LB blitzing the adjacent gap. He has no problem \nstanding up a safety in the pocket.  \nIn 2023, Hampton overextended before he delivered his hands and opponents could swim over him to win the interaction. \nThis is a common occurrence against linebackers with momentum into an interior crease. He had more reps in 2024 where \nhe didn’t overextend, but Hampton hasn’t eliminated this issue from his game. \nBall Security: Hampton carries the ball close to his chest but with his elbow wide of his frame. He uses his boundary-side \narm on plays feeding him the ball outside the hash. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm and maintain possession.  \nHampton has lapses where he defaults to his left arm regardless of the play design. He has 373 touches with 5 fumbles, 1 \nper 74.6.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I’d prefer to consider Hampton in the second round instead of the top half of the first \nround. It means I’m unlikely to acquire him in rookie drafts. His NFL Draft capital will likely be good enough to earn a first- \nor second-round pick in fantasy drafts. Opportunities lead to production if the player is competent enough. Hampton is good \nenough as long as he limits unforced errors.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nWide route, patience-double up/juke after catch \n• \nTight-crease aggression \n• \nHard stick  \n• \nStride adjustment, stiff arm, pad level, and setting up pullers \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n92",
        "analysis": "Omarion Hampton is a talented running back prospect with a size-speed combination that excites many scouts.  However, his profile presents a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Speed:** Hampton's 5'11\", 221-pound frame combined with a 4.48 40-yard dash time suggests a potentially explosive player.  His long speed is a significant asset, capable of generating breakaway runs when he gets a clear path.\n* **Power and Contact Balance:** He's a powerful runner who excels at using his size and leverage to break tackles, especially when running downhill.  He demonstrates good contact balance, bouncing off hits and maintaining forward momentum.\n* **Vision and Patience:**  Hampton shows maturity in his decision-making, displaying patience behind the line of scrimmage and effectively reading blocking schemes to find the optimal running lane.  He's adept at finding cutback lanes and adjusting his stride length to create openings.\n* **Receiving and Pass Blocking:** He's a capable receiver out of the backfield, showcasing good route running ability and reliable hands (though with some occasional fumbling issues), and shows promise in pass protection.  He demonstrates the ability to identify and pick up blitzers.\n* **Versatility:** Hampton's skillset allows him to contribute in various running schemes, excelling in inside and outside zone runs, gap schemes, and draw plays.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Acceleration:** While his top-end speed is impressive, his initial burst needs improvement.  This limits his ability to consistently create the necessary separation for breakaway runs.\n* **Ball Security:**  His fumbles are a significant concern.  Improving his ball security is crucial to increase his playing time and overall value.\n* **Pass Protection Consistency:** While showing promise,  inconsistencies in his pass protection need to be addressed for him to become a three-down back.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Ball Security:**  A recurring issue; his fumble rate is above the acceptable threshold for NFL running backs.\n* **Initial Acceleration:** Not elite; struggles to consistently create separation from defenders early in runs, limiting the frequency of his breakaway runs.\n* **Pass Protection Timing:** While he has the ability, occasionally anticipates blitzes incorrectly which leads to missed blocks.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison to Tyler Allgeier is interesting.  While Allgeier is slightly slower, he reportedly possesses comparable initial acceleration and has proven capable of explosive gains.  The comparison to Jonathan Williams suggests a player who can be a valuable rotational back, but perhaps lacks the ceiling to become a consistent feature back.  Both comparisons hint at a potentially valuable rotational back, but one who might not be an every-down starter unless he drastically improves his weaknesses.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB11 \nJersey No. 1 / No. 0 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/196 School: SMU/Miami \nComparison Spectrum: Aaron Jones - X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.6 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUNC ‘23 \n• \nClemson ‘23 \n• \nBYU ‘24 \n• \nLouisville ‘24 \n• \nCalifornia ‘24 \n• \nClemson ’24  \n• \nPenn State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A four-star wide receiver prospect at Miami, Smith was a second-team All-ACC return specialist and \nhonorable mention “all-purpose player.” He transferred to SMU in 2024 and became a running back.  \nSmith’s game experienced rapid growth throughout the two years he earned snaps as a runner. For several weeks, he never \nused a stiff arm. Suddenly it became a good part of repertoire on outside runs. Smith went from a mediocre stalk blocker at \nwide receiver to a displaying sound technique when cut-blocking box defenders. \nSmith is a smart runner who sets up blocks, displays situational maturity as a game manager, and has developed a \ncompelling set of skills behind zone blocking. Gap blocking is where he’s a bit behind and he still has room to grow when \nidentifying what the defense is doing, pre-snap.  \nSmith has good footwork, a range of successful moves, and curvilinear speed. He has stretches where he leans too much on \nthe spin, but there’s enough in his toolbox that he should grow past it.  \nBecause you can use Smith as a receiver, it may not matter as much for his early-career opportunities that his blocking is \nstill a work in progress. Considering how fast Tyrone Tracy and Robert Edwards acclimated to the position, Smith’s film is \ncompelling enough to believe he could be next.  \nConceptual: The overreliance on the spin in the box and the open field is holding Smith back from starter-level vision. If he \nfixes this, he could be one of the most skilled options in this class.  \nVision: In the open field, Smith reads the leverage of a blocker on a defender and works to that blocker’s side. Between the \ntackles, he’ll attack toward a double-team and press outside-in against edge penetration to set up a crease inside. He can \npress within a step of his blocks.  \nBetween the tackles Smith will adjust his pace and stride length to set up blocks. Smith shows maturity as a red-zone \nrunner. He works towards the soft spot of a compressed box and generates a push behind his blockers even when the \ncrease in that soft spot doesn’t open.   \nHe can miss early cutback opportunities he’d spot if he had a better command of pre-snap alignments and box counts. As a \nresult, he gets strung out for losses.  \nAs a gap runner, Smith will set up pullers into their assignments with his approach to the line behind them on runs between \nthe tackles. He’s a capable tight-crease runner on gap and zone plays. When running power or behind a puller outside the \ntackle, Smith can bounce way too early and not give his puller’s a chance to give him a downhill run.  \nWhen the puller is a guard rather than a tackle or tight end, Smith can get depth into the line before sliding across the \nformation to follow the puller and leverage this block. Smith identifies and executes cutbacks appropriately on inside gap \nplays like Power.  \nSmith will press zone runs within a step of the line or even tighter. He can peek outside slide back inside for positive \nyardage in a compressed box with the primary gap filled.  \n\n \n93 \nPart of Smith’s inexperience shows when he attempts to spin against a linebacker filling the intended gap on a wind back or \nzone play. He’d be better of attacking the crease with his pads down or use a move that keeps his pads downhill instead of \nturning his back on the defender. He tips off his spins (see elusiveness) or he uses it to put his back into the oncoming \ndefender instead of finishing with his pads.  \nElusiveness: Smith adjusts his stride length to set up blocks at the line of scrimmage and then hits the hole decisively. He \nhas quick jump cuts too work laterally around a defender over the top shooting for him downhill. Smith will get around the \ndefender and downhill fast.  \nWhen working the far-side edge of the box on a perimeter run, Smith can transition downhill with two quick steps. He flips \nhis hips efficiently from the perimeter to downhill as a one-cut runner between the tackles.  \nSmith can also work the far-side edge and stay inbounds while transitioning downhill at full speed with curvilinear \nmovement or one transition step. Smith can even transition downhill with a spin.  \nHe gets his feet over low shots from penetrating linemen as he’s working a perimeter run.  \nSmith has a spin move that, oddly, has become more telegraphed as he’s earned more work as a runner. It’s because he’s \ntrying to apply it in spaces that he shouldn’t. When in the tackle box or facing down 3-4 unblocked defenders in the open \nfield, he turns sideways and uses 2-3 deceleration steps to set up the turn. This makes the spin far more deliberate, which \nmeans it might not be the best choice for the situations where he does this.  \nWhen Smith uses the spin in the middle of the field or in one-on-one situations where he has a downhill path to plant and \nspin, the move is explosive and effective without any telegraphing.  \nHe decelerates well in the backfield to get tight to his pullers and slide to the open gap.  \nAcceleration: Smith has the acceleration to blow past linebackers up the middle through a clean interior crease, split \nsafeties, and hold off cornerbacks for 75-80 yards. Smith accelerates past inside and outside linebackers to the near-side \nedge and up the boundary despite both having good angles on him.  \nSpeed: Smith has the acceleration to blow past linebackers up the middle through a clean interior crease, split safeties, and \nhold off cornerbacks for 75-80 yards. \nPower: Smith will keep his feet moving after contact to his frame. He pulls through reaches to his lower legs. He can pull \nthrough multiple reaches to his lower legs during the same attempt. He has developed a stiff arm as a perimeter runner and \nwill ward off the reaches of defensive backs as he reaches the corner.  \nSmith can turn into a linebacker wrapping him and generate a push of 2-3 yards. He can also generate a push of 2-3 yards \nagainst a defensive tackle or end wrapping him high—as long as there’s a guard or tackle there to help generate a push. \nThe good thing with Smith is that he maintains his footing and moves his feet well until the whistle or he’s taken down.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Smith wins collisions with safeties meeting him downhill. At Miami, he turned his back into an \noncoming middle linebacker at the end of an interior crease. \nAt SMU, Smith was winning collisions with defensive ends—taking one side of the chest and generating a push with good \npad level and leg drive.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Smith will attack downhill into a tight crease and initiate a hit with a blocked defensive tackle \nwith his pads to generate a small push. He can bounce off shots to his lower legs from defensive tackles, linebackers and \nsafeties. He stalemates the bumps from linemen. He can stalemate a hit to his pads from a linebacker shooting an interior \ngap and push forward. \nSmith has an effective balance touch to work through lower-leg wraps and hits to knock him off his stride.  \nRoutes: When split wide of the formation as a receiver, he has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring \nhis front leg. He sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion when he begins his release. He has \nlapses where he rocks off the back foot.  \nHe’ll steal a release in the run game with a hesitation before closing the gap to block the off-coverage defender.  \n\n \n94 \nSmith will reduce the shoulder against off coverage playing inside shade and shooting their hands. When working to the \nboundary, he must use his hands better so he’s not pinned to the sideline.  \nSmith widens stems to attack outside leverage so he can work inside on a vertical route. He dives inside to attack inside \nshade during his stems. \nHe’ll counter the hands of a defender at the top of his stem on a fade with a wipe.  \nSmith uses a small head fake inside or outside during his stem against off-coverage. He can emphasize it more.  \nWhen running a speed break, Smith’s drive and line steps are flat on shallow routes. He gets his head around to the \nquarterback early in his break. He’ll use a lean-in to set up the break at the top of his stem.  \nHe has a crisp three-step break against off-coverage. He doesn’t drop his weight with every rep he performs a three-step \nbreak but when he does, the weight drop is adequate and he’s running the stem at full speed into the break.  \nSmith owns the boundary well on fades so he can buy back space before the catch.  \nSmith identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open zone with a friendly position to the \nquarterback.   \nReceiving: Smith can make late full extensions of his arms and frame for a target that flies past his frame and also leading \nhim ahead of his break. He looks like Brandon Lloyd making this adjustment. He can make the fingertip snare and earn the \nsecond-chance opportunity to secure and retract when the attempt isn’t clean the first time.  \nSmith can embrace the fall after making acrobatic adjustments.  \nSmith can attack the ball with overhand position at his chest when the ball arrives on his chest faster than he anticipated. \nEven with this unexpected arrival schedule, Smith retracts the ball fast and transitions immediately with good catch-and-\npierce technique.  \nSmith tracks targets over his shoulder with underhand attack in stride. He can also adjust to targets thrown away from his \nbreak path, tracking them over his shoulder with one hand away from his frame and transitioning downhill seamlessly.  \nSmith has lapses with clap-attacking high-point targets behind his break path—this is common for this target type because \nof how a player often extends without getting their hands together, first. The same is true with targets behind his break \npath that are onto his frame. Smith either clap-attacks to either side of the ball or he clap-attacks with high-low hand \nposition.  \nSmith high-points effectively and can bring the ball down with one hand, if needed. He can deliver a pullback and embrace \nthe fall near the boundary, dragging the feet to get both in bounds against tight man coverage in his face at the catch point.  \nSmith uses underhand position for targets at the belt line. He can use underhand position to attack at shoe height away \nfrom his frame and maintain his footing.  \nHe can make one-handed spinning catches with underhand position at the beltline.  \nBlocking: As a lead blocker on RPOs where he’s split wide, Smith squares the defender inside-out with a wide stance and \nhis knees bent. His arms are wide but he closes the gap to the defender with his elbows bent. He doesn’t strike the \ndefender.  \nSmith moves his feet well and remains close to the defender when the defender gives chase to the ball carrier ahead of \nthem. He will use a one-arm technique effectively to pin a defender outside as his teammates work inside.  \nHe identifies slot defender blitzes and will reverse course across the pocket to square the opponent.  \nSmith is light-footed and shuffles his feet laterally to slide outside with edge pressure to remain square with them. He has \nlapses where he over sets and gives up the inside rush lane.  \nSmith can cut defensive ends in the pocket. He times his shot and works across the frame of the opponent with good height \nbefore shooting through the target with his head up. He has a standing cut block against A-Gap pressure, but must earn \nbetter position with it.  \n\n \n95 \nHis stand-up game is much more about shielding defenders and helping double teams. Otherwise, the crux of his \neffectiveness one-on-one is cut blocking. He must develop strikes and coordinating his hands and feet. His only work that \nincludes striking are chips at the edge.  \nBall Security: Smith has 5 fumbles in 419 touches during a 4-year college career – 1 per 83.8. He had 3 fumbles in 289 \ntouches as a first-time starter in 2024 – 1 per 96.3.  \nSmith can take contact to the ball-carrying arm from a defensive back shooting for his side. He carries the ball close to his \nchest with some lapses of it coming loose from his chest and his elbow not tight to his frame.  \nSmith must switch the ball faster so he’s not hanging loose. He has lost the ball late in a run while trying to switch the ball \nto the side away from pursuit.  \nOnce he became a full-time back at SMU, Smith showed he could take contact to the ball and he made small improvements \nwith tightening the security to his chest. There are still frequent lapses to clean up.  \nDurability: Played through a collarbone injury in 2024. No significant time missed in three years.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: None of the skills Smith must improve are insurmountable. Most of them will improve with \na reasonable amount of attention. If they do, Smith could easily become an every-down starter.  \n \nSmith is worth his present value, and if his draft capital enhances his value after the NFL has made his decision, he’ll likely \nbe worth his value in May and June.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nAcrobatic catch \n• \nThree-step break with weight drop, quick hands, catch and pierce \n• \nFade vs. safety \n• \nPacing, acceleration, speed, ball security lapse \n• \nShoe-top catch, balance out of extension, open field \n• \nPre-snap box counts/alignment knowledge needed \n• \nAcceleration, speed, curvilinear control, contact balance, and raw decision-making \n• \nContact balance vs. DE \n• \nFootwork, spin, contact balance and finish while running to perimeter \n• \nTelegraphing the spin \n• \nCut blocks DE \n• \nA-Gap cut block \n• \nDeep fade vs. LB, high catch vs tight contact in face/chest, pull back, boundary work \n• \nRed-zone maturity \n• \nClap-attack/focus drop – the combo where he has lapses with drops \n• \nPatiently manipulates A-Gap LB and splits double team on Duo \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n96",
        "analysis": "**Brashard Smith - RB Prospect Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:** Possesses excellent footwork, a diverse move set (including a potent spin move when used correctly), and curvilinear speed, allowing him to make defenders miss in both open space and the tackle box.  He displays good acceleration and top-end speed, capable of breaking off big plays.\n* **Receiving Ability:** Shows potential as a receiving back with good route running skills, especially on vertical routes and fades. He displays impressive hands, making acrobatic catches and adjusting well to poorly thrown balls.\n* **Situational Awareness:** Demonstrates maturity in game situations, particularly in the red zone, where he shows excellent patience and vision to find the soft spots in the defense.  He's also shown an ability to set up blocks effectively in zone running schemes.\n* **Contact Balance:**  Smith displays good balance and leg drive, allowing him to maintain his footing after contact and break tackles. He is effective at pushing through contact from smaller defensive backs and even larger defensive linemen (with help).\n* **Improving Blocker:** While still developing, he shows noticeable improvement in his blocking technique from his time at WR to his time at RB. His cut blocking is a strength.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Spin Move:** His reliance on the spin move can be predictable, especially in unfavorable situations.  Improving his vision and decision-making will help him choose more effective moves in the tackle box and against multiple defenders.\n* **Improve Pre-Snap Reads:** Needs to enhance his ability to read defenses pre-snap, which would lead to better decision-making and fewer missed cutback opportunities.\n* **Gap Blocking Consistency:** While showing improvement, he needs to consistently improve his gap blocking techniques to become a more complete back.\n* **Ball Security:** Though his fumbles are low considering his touches, there are still lapses in ball security he must address; tightening his hold and improving his ball-switching technique.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  Aaron Jones is cited as a comparison, highlighting Smith's elusiveness and receiving ability.  However,  Jones is a more polished blocker and has better vision, suggesting Smith's development needs to focus on these areas to reach that level.  Other comparisons might include players like Nyheim Hines (for receiving and elusiveness) or perhaps a less-powerful version of  Austin Ekeler (receiving, agility).\n\n**Overall:** Brashard Smith is a talented running back prospect with a high ceiling. His elusiveness, receiving skills, and improving blocking make him an intriguing player.  Addressing his opportunities for improvement, particularly vision and consistency in blocking and ball security, will determine if he can reach his full potential as a rotational starter or even an every-down back in the NFL.\n"

        "player_name": "Jordan James",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB12 \nJersey: No.20 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/205 School: Oregon  \nComparison Spectrum: Blake Corum/X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.4 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUtah ‘23 \n• \nCal ‘23 \n• \nUSC ‘23 \n• \nUW ‘23 \n• \nOhio State I ‘24 \n• \nMichigan ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: James’ Depth of Talent Score is the same as Trevor Etienne and Kyle Monangai. All three are roughly \nthe same height. Etienne is the lightest and most explosive. Monangai is the most powerful and could carry a significant \nload – he’s also one of the best at holding onto the football this class.  \nJames is a blend of both players. He’s quicker than fast, but his long speed is still within the RSP’s range for a starter.  \nHe’s not as big as Monangai, but he has the size, power, contact, balance, and skills of a finisher to work through multiple \npoints of contact during a play. James and Monangai have over 1,000 touches between them and haven’t fumbled the ball.  \nJames is also the strongest game manager of the three when carrying the ball. He has a lot of Etienne’s toolbox of moves.  \nJames has the most work to do as a pass-catcher. He clap-traps targets and has fought the ball as a result. He makes plays \nas a receiver but the technique is sloppy.  \nJames is the best blocker of the trio. He picks up blitzes with good diagnosis, strong position, and sound technique at the \npoint of attack.  \nEtienne is the most compelling game-breaker of the three. Monangai is the most compelling runner. James is the most \nversatile and possibly the best candidate to become a lead back.  \nVision: James identifies edge and interior penetration and dips away from the defender. He sets up force defenders on \nperimeter runs with presses inside to create the space to the outside.  \nJames presses toward defenders with leverage advantages on gap plays where he’s setting that defender up so he can cut \naway and follow the puller.  \nJames will attack the designed double team with authority when the gaps are filled but there are no options to bounce or \ncutback. His presses often are as deep as a step from the line or defender.  \nHe reads the pace of his pullers and as the play unfolds at the entrance of the designated crease, he can find the cutback \nbased on the play’s development.  \nJames is an effective tight-crease runner who doesn’t bounce plays outside because he’s reticent to attack a small crease as \nthe play design dictates. He hits creases with authority.  \nElusiveness: James can transition downhill from a perimeter track to a downhill track on runs to the near side numbers \nwith 1-2 small steps. He can reach the edge of the box and transition with one step. \nJames also has the mobility to add a spin after the transition to work away from the containment. He does the same off a \npressure cut. He also delivers his pressure cuts as full speed, which helps him press toward and avoid penetration on short-\nyardage plays.  \nJames leans hard on the spin as his primary attempt to work past contact, but he has a strong repertoire of other moves, \nand he’s good at layering them in succession to work around pursuit and get downhill.  \n\n \n97 \nHe points the toe and open his hips effectively to bounce outside. James also has quick jump cuts in tight space.  \nAcceleration: James can accelerate past safeties when taking downhill tracks. He also accelerates past safeties on \nperimeter runs to the far sideline. He beats linebackers and safeties in space to the short sideline. He can work past a \ncornerback in the second level even when the cornerback has an angle.  \nSpeed: James has adequate speed as a starter. He won’t have many breakaway runs, he’ll hold off pursuit long enough to \nflip the field when he gets into a secondary.  \nPower: James has an effective stiff arm in space to ward off reaches to his frame. He pulls through reaches from defensive \nbacks. He finishes with low pad level against cornerbacks in open space. He also uses the stiff arm to move blockers out of \nthe way in the hole and greet defensive backs downhill as a finisher.  \nJames pulls through multiple reaches to his frame when he’s heading downhill. He gets his feet and knees high through \ncontact.  \nAlthough he’s not going to push piles and carry defenders on his back like Jonathan Taylor or Nick Chubb, James has good \npad level in traffic and can keep his legs moving to earn an addition 3-4 yards against box defenders wrapping him high.  \nDirect Contact Balance: James can win direct collisions with cornerbacks in the flat when he has a runway into the \ncollision and the defender is flat-footed. He can beat a safety who has a few steps into the collision with James working \ndownhill with momentum. \nJames can also push a linebacker downhill when James has the downhill momentum into direct contact as the linebacker is \nflat-footed and a blocker is close to help the push—consider this more of a stalemate without the blocker helping.  \nWhen James drops his pads downhill into a linebacker with less of runway but shooting for James, James can win the \ncollision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: James has excellent flexibility and maneuverability against contact. He can spin and balance-\ntouch from a cornerback’s hits to his legs. He’ll bounce off a safety’s glancing shot when both parties have momentum into \nthe collision. He won’t keep his feet for long, but he can earn extra yardage off the collision.  \nJames can bounce off hits to his side and legs from off-ball linebackers.  \nRoutes: He sells the potential for the out with his eyes and head on a wheel or bullet route and can fool the off-coverage.  \nJames has a long break step and displays promise with dropping his weight at the top of his stems on stop routes. He also \naccelerates into the long break step. James is aware of the boundary on out-breaking routes.  \nReceiving: James catches circle routes at his chest with underhand position tight to his frame. There’s a clapping motion to \nthe chest. James has dropped and juggled targets due to his clap-attack on the ball.  \nHe reaches behind his break path with underhand position and snares the ball on his back hip and executes a smooth pull \nback so he can catch and pierce downhill. \nJames can high-point with his feet on the ground. He tracks the ball over his shoulder on vertical routes. Oregon primarily \nused James as a check-down option or for underneath zones, screens, flats, and RPOs. \nBlocking: James transitions well from receiver to blocker. He closes the gap between himself and the defender, taking the \nair away from them. His elbows are bent and he aims for the chest.  \nJames overextends into assignments as a lead blocker and leads to one-and-done interactions that give the defender \nposition to reach the ball carrier.  \nAs a pass protector, James identifies edge pressure and slides across the pocket to earn position on the blitzer and gain \ndepth in the pocket. He has a good bend with a squat and square position to the defender. He aims for the defender’s chest \nwith elbows bent.  \nJames times his strikes well and because of them, he can win hard collisions with larger defenders. But he’s not delivering a \npunch with hip roll and that leads to one-and-done strikes in those situations. He will move his feet against edge defenders \nand run them outside the pocket after the strike.  \n\n \n98 \nJames reads tackle-end twists and earns position to take on the end working to the inside. He can deliver the first punch \nand contact to a linebacker through the A-Gap and push him into the guard who is there to help with a double team and \nthen release into the shallow zone.  \nHe identifies cross-blitzes pre-snap. Whether he and his linemen have been on the same page has been a different story. \nWhen two defenders blitz the edge, James takes the inside man correctly.  \nJames will cut block linebackers through the A-Gap. He has a timely attack through the assignment and across the frame \nwith good height.  \nJames also has good timing and position to cut ends off the edge. His standing cut block is also effective one-on-one against \nlinemen.  \nBall Security: James switches the ball to his boundary-side arm during a run. He carries the ball close to his chest and with \nhis elbow tight to his frame without swinging it. James has lapses where his elbow is loose from his frame. James has 430 \ncareer touches during his three seasons at Oregon and never fumbled the football.  \nDurability: Concussion in 2025 Rose Bowl.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: James is likely a third- or fourth-round pick in most fantasy leagues before the NFL Draft \nbegins. There could be a lot of variation after.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMobility and body awareness \n• \nPad level and tight creases \n• \nManipulating defenders and splitting a double team \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023-24 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n99",

        "player_name": "Trevor Etienne",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB13 \nJersey: No.7 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/198 School: Florida/Georgia \nComparison Spectrum: Marshall Faulk - Charlie Garner/Jahmyr Gibbs -X- Kevin Faulk \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.4 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUtah ‘23 \n• \nTennessee ‘23 \n• \nUGA ‘23 \n• \nMissouri ‘23 \n• \nAuburn ‘24 \n• \nTexas ‘25 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Trevor Etienne is the best running back in his family. His brother, Travis, has speed, receiving chops, \nand a determined running style. Trevor has those three qualities and more nuance and craft between the tackles.  \nTrevor reads leverage and sets up creases better. Although Trevor is also best-suited for gap plays, he is more adept at \nrunning Duo and Zone schemes at this stage of his career than Travis.  \nTrevor has sudden deceleration, good lateral cuts, pace changes, and curvilinear speed to set up blocks and work away from \nunblocked defenders. He alters angles of pursuit well enough that he’s running through reaches and wraps instead of hits—if \nhe’s getting hit at all.  \nAt his size, Trevor is more momentum-based with his power than raw strength. Because he accelerates fast, he generates \nthe power to run through contact, drag defenders, and even push them downfield – most of this happens in the second and \nthird level of the defense.  \nAlthough a good receiver—and getting the ball into open space is how teams will want to use him—Trevor must clean up his \nattack. He has lapses with how best to attack targets based on their location. He catches most targets, but the sharper the \ndetails of a player’s game, the more bandwidth is available for him to take on new information – and rookies often suffer \nbecause of information overload.  \nOverall, Trevor has the skills to contribute immediately to a backfield as a change-of-pace runner and receiver as long as a \nteam minimizes his blocking early on. There are things to clean up with his game, but he also has the athletic ability and \ntalents as a runner to have an immediate impact in an offense.  \nThere’s some boom-bust to his immediate prospects but long-term, he should fare well as a committee back with starter \nproduction thanks to his versatility. If D’Andre Swift has had the success he’s had, Etienne offers more as a runner and \nsimilar as a receiver.  \nVision: Etienne reads leverage in the backfield on off-tackle zone effectively, presses the lead block and finds the cutback \nlane. Etienne sets up interior gap plays effectively. He reads penetration from slanting defenders quick enough to avoid \nthem and get into the open crease. He’s at his best running gap plays, which he excelled at Florida.  \nEtienne sets up perimeter runs with presses of interior gaps. He can press within one step of his blocker to set up bounces \nand cutbacks. He’ll look for bounces and cutbacks but when he sees an unblocked defender in the box, he’ll stick with the \nplay design inside to avoid a significant loss. He can stick with a bounce on Duo when he should cutback based on the flow \nof the wind back or lead blocks and the leverage of the interior double teams.  \nWith zone runs, Etienne doesn’t press deep enough. He’ll press within 2-3 steps of the line but forgoes opportunities to \npress within a step of his linemen so he can better influence an edge defender on a block and get a clean cutback.  \nEtienne displays some feel for front-side penetration in the crease on Duo and finds the cutback lane with the backside \ndouble team. However, Etienne is consistently a step later than he should be to make a change of direction against this \npenetration.  \n\n \n100 \nHe’s a decisive gap runner when working between the tackles. He reads penetration and understands the play design to \nremain patient and stick with the path behind the puller.  \nElusiveness: Etienne can vary his stride to set up cutbacks. He’ll use stride length and pacing variations to set up lead \nblockers. When he spots penetration during the exchange, Etienne can point the toe and open the hips to work away from \nthe pursuit.  \nEtienne can drop his weight for quick deceleration to set up a change of direction from penetration at the line of scrimmage. \nHe can also jump stop and jump cut to set up a press inside and cutback outside. When leaping over defenders’ shots, he \ngets his hips downhill early so he can accelerate as he hits the ground.  \nEtienne has the control to bend away from a safety coming down hill while emerging from a crease at a high rate of speed. \nGood curvilinear movement. Etienne gives a double up with the outside foot to set up a dip inside the cornerback in the flat.  \nEtienne needs 2-3 steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach. When working off-tackle inside the box, he can \ntransition with two quick steps. He can open his hips for quick 90 degree turns in traffic. He only needs  1-2 steps to go \nfrom a downhill path at good pace to a perimeter path.  \nHe has a tight spin in close quarters. He has a strong stick to set up bounces. He gives a and takes away the pursuit-side \nleg in the crease, juking an unblocked linebacker filling the gap and getting around the defender.  \nEtienne routinely gets his feet high enough to work over lower-body reaches. He will duck or use a shoulder fake to avoid \npursuit. He layers moves in succession in tight space to make box defenders miss. He makes multiple defenders miss on the \nsame run.  \nAcceleration: Etienne has the acceleration to work around linebackers that have a leverage advantage on his puller \nblocking him during a gap play. He can beat linebackers through the hole who have angles and force safeties to come down \nfor the tackle.  \nEtienne has the acceleration to work to the short-side perimeter on a well-blocked play and get into the secondary. He also \nbeats box defenders to the far-side perimeter—even unblocked SEC athletes. Etienne beats cornerbacks playing over his on \nan island in the flat. He can accelerate around them to the boundary.  \nSpeed: When working up the middle or through a crease around tackle, Etienne can beat all three levels of defenders and \nhold off a backside corner for 40-60 yards. He’ll hold off a front-side corner who began pursuing at box depth for about 20-\n25 yards. He’s fast enough to challenge safeties, but not a breakaway threat against corners on his side of the field. But \ncorners from the opposite field won’t catch him on a long run. When he opens up he pulls away.  \nPower: Etienne has effective pad level through the crease and keeps his feet moving through contact. With his low center \nof gravity Etienne pulls through reaches to his pads and chest from pursuing box defenders. He also keeps his feet moving \nthrough wraps and can drag a defender 1-2 yards. He can push the pile when the pile is composed of defensive backs and \nmaybe a linebacker.  \nHe doesn’t use the stiff-arm enough in scenarios where it would benefit him. Etienne tends to use a forearm and when he \nextends the hand for a stiff-arm, he can be late with it and land it when the arm maybe halfway extended compared to \nwhere he could have landed it.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Etienne will attack a safety head-on when he has momentum downhill. When both have \nmomentum, he can take the hit and spin off the contact. He can knock down a cornerback even if he doesn’t run through \nthe wrap. He’ll stalemate a linebacker at the end of a crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Etienne stalemates hits to his pads and side from outside linebackers as he works through a \ncrease. He can bounce off and work through multiple hits to his pads from defensive backs during a run.  \nRoutes: When detached from the formation, Etienne initiates contact against a cornerback with a wipe and counters with a \nshed. He’ll widen stems against off-coverage linebackers on leak routes and use his eyes to sell that stem.  \nEtienne identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open zone. When the quarterback breaks \nthe pocket, Etienne works into open space where the quarterback can find him and creates a friendly target as he does so.  \n\n \n101 \nHe uses a hesitation at the top of his stems against off-coverage to set up a break to the outside. He snaps his breaks with \nflat drive and line steps and gets his head around fast. \nReceiving: Etienne uses underhand attack with targets at chest level and below. He can extend behind his break path with \none hand and make an underhand catch and turn up the field into a hit to his back and maintain possession of the ball. He \ncan use overhand or underhand position away from his frame and tight to his frame.  \nOn leak routes, Etienne extends his arms to the ball, but he clap-attacks with mixed hands position. He can extend his arms \nto targets away from his frame and use overhand position when the target his at shoulder height and above.  \nEtienne can use overhand position for targets at his back shoulder and turn through the catch to transition downhill—\nobeying the ball and catch-and-pierce technique. Etienne attacks overhand and underhand targets away from his frame and \nat the earliest available window to set up transitions downhill.  \nBlocking: Etienne identifies edge blitzes and works inside-out to square the pressure with his knees bent and feet wide \nenough for a stable base. He overextends into the defender, dropping his head so early that A) he can’t see what he’s \nhitting and B) he tips off the defender and the defender can get his hands on Etienne before Etienne makes any contact.  \nWhen he’s not tipping off his hits, Eitenne leans into contact with one pad rather than squaring and striking with his hands. \nIf he can learn to punch and time it well, he could become an effective pass protector with his stand-up game. Right now, \nhe identifies pressure well but he either gets too aggressive or he shies away from delivering a hit with good position.  \nThe root issue is the lack of a technically-sound punch. Even against defensive backs, Etienne catches contact and his hands \nare too wide. He can anchor against lighter defenders who strike first despite earning downhill momentum, but he could win \nthese interactions handily with legitimate technique.  \nHis hands can be tight enough to work the chest of the opponent. Etienne aims for the chest plate and he strikes with his \nelbows bent when he’s not leaning into contact and overextending.  \nWhen Etienne has a chip-release between the tackles, he drops his head, but late enough that his pads can initiate contact \nwith the chest of the box defender. Etienne has a standing cut block on linebackers where he’ll shoot through the target \nwith good height and timing at the waist, working across the frame of the opponent.  \nEtienne diagnoses straight-forward assignments well. Interior twists can be problematic. He has missed multiple \nopportunities to pick up an interior twist between defensive tackles.  \nWhen Etienne manages to get his hands in front of the interaction and his overextension doesn’t hurt him, he moves his \nfeet after contact and slides laterally with blitzing linebackers and defensive backs to remain square. He’s at his best as a \nstriker with chip-releases and even then, he misses chips that are vital and it leads to sacks.  \nBall Security: Etienne carries the ball high to his frame and with his elbow tight to his frame. The elbow can get loose as \nhe’s finishing plays through contact but he doesn’t swing the ball when he runs.  \nEtienne uses the boundary-side arm to protect the ball. He has lapses where he tucks the ball to his inside arm when \ncatching a target at the boundary with pursuit at his inside arm. He has 459 touches and 4 career fumbles—1 fumble per \n114.75 touches.   \nDurability: No significant injuries to report.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Etienne’s draft capital could be high enough for him to be a second- or third-round pick in \nrookie drafts. It could also decrease his value to the fourth or fifth round. There’s a wide range of outcomes for him after \nthe NFL Draft. Right now, the second half of the second round to the first half of the third round seems reasonable.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPass pro woes \n• \nOverextension in pass pro \n• \nEfficient hips \n• \nGood vs Better: Press and cut footwork \n• \nFootwork, Attack of Creases, Hips, Acceleration, and Speed \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n\n \n102",
        "analysis": "Trevor Etienne is a versatile running back with a high ceiling but also some areas needing refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:**  Possesses excellent lateral agility, deceleration, and change-of-pace ability, allowing him to make defenders miss in tight spaces and navigate through congested areas.  His curvilinear movement is a significant asset.\n* **Vision and Instincts:** Shows a good understanding of leverage and gap schemes, particularly in gap runs. He effectively reads defensive penetration and finds cutback lanes.  Excels at setting up blocks and working away from unblocked defenders.\n* **Power Runner:** While not possessing overwhelming raw strength, he generates power through acceleration and momentum, allowing him to run through contact, drag defenders, and push the pile.\n* **Receiving Ability:** A capable receiver, although he needs to improve the precision of his route running and target attack. He is reliable catching the ball and can make plays in space.\n* **Acceleration and Speed:**  Impressive acceleration to quickly get through holes and gain an advantage on defenders.  Possesses sufficient speed to make long runs and challenge safeties, though he's not a breakaway threat against elite cornerbacks.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Route Running and Receiving Technique:** Needs improvement in attack angle on targets and route precision to maximize his receiving potential.  Sharper details in his receiving game will free up cognitive bandwidth for other aspects.\n* **Improve Pass Blocking:** While he identifies blitzes well, his technique needs work.  Developing a consistent and powerful punch will dramatically improve his pass protection.\n* **Consistency in Zone Runs:**  He needs to be more consistent in pressing the line of scrimmage on zone runs to better influence blocks and create cutback opportunities.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report offers a range of comparisons:\n\n* **Marshall Faulk:**  High praise, suggesting a potential for all-around excellence as a runner and receiver. This is likely his highest possible outcome.\n* **Charlie Garner:** A solid comparison, emphasizing his versatility and ability to contribute in various roles.\n* **Jahmyr Gibbs:**  A more recent comparison, highlighting his ability as an elusive runner and pass-catching back.  This comparison seems more realistic for his immediate future.\n* **Kevin Faulk:**  A comparison emphasizing his receiving ability and potential as a change-of-pace back.  This is likely a lower-end outcome comparison, focusing on his receiving strengths.\n\n**Overall:** Etienne has the potential to be a productive NFL running back, capable of contributing as both a runner and receiver. His success hinges on improving his pass protection and refining his route running/receiving technique. His immediate role will likely be as a change-of-pace back, but with refinement, he could develop into a more featured player.  The Gibbs comparison seems the most likely near-term outcome, while the Faulk comparisons represent higher potential outcomes contingent upon improvement in certain areas.\n"

        "player_name": "Kyle Monangai",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB14 \nJersey: No.5 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/211 School: Rutgers  \nComparison Spectrum: Ray Rice - Jaylen Warren - X/Ray Davis \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.4 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nMichigan State ’23  \n• \nOhio State ‘23 \n• \nMiami ’23  \n• \nWisconsin ‘24 \n• \nUCLA ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Monangai is a tough and smart runner with good feet and a low center of gravity. Add it up and his \ngame screams, Never say die.  \nMonangai uses his height and weight to his advantage. He’s elusive in tight confines and thrives off stop-start movement, \nhip mobility, and contact balance to avoid or mitigate contact from multiple defenders in succession.  \nShort-area quickness and contact balance are the strengths of Monangai’s athletic profile as a runner. He may lack long \nspeed, but he has a lot of the play stamina that makes Ashton Jeanty a special prospect.  \nMonangai has strong contact balance. The only form of contact I haven’t seen him win is direct hits from defensive linemen.  \nHis acceleration is good enough to reach the secondary and his play stamina is rare enough to force multiple defenders to \nrally to him. If they don’t get there within a similar amount of time, Monangai has the determination and craftiness to \nregain the momentum and continue making life difficult.  \nMonangai would be at least close to one of my top-five backs on the board if he was a better pass protector. He has work to \ndo with positioning his body so he’s dictating terms with a balanced and controlled starting position at the point of the \ncollision.  \nMonangai can catch the ball with the appropriate attack but his allows the ball too close to his frame. He’s not used often as \na receiver, but he should deliver as a check-down option based on what he has shown on tape. \nRay Rice and Maurice Jones-Drew are at the top of the continuum of the short-but-not-small, powerful, agile, and quick \nbacks who can carry a substantial. Recent players along this continuum include Jaylen Warren and Ray Davis. Monangai \ncould be the best of those recent additions despite being the slowest.  \nHe’ll earn a roster spot and it won’t shock me if he earns a recurring role and eventually, a productive one, too.  \nVision: Monangai follows his lead blocker on inside play designs. With Duo, he’s adept at approaching the hole at a slower \npace to set up double teams and then accelerate through the hole.  \nWith inside zone, Monangai presses his inside blocks to set up bounces or cutbacks and can press within a step of the \nblocker.  \nMonangai doesn’t take unnecessary risks as a game manager based on down-and-distance and field position scenarios. He’s \nan effective tight-crease runner who reads the leverage of defenders and attacks where the pay is blocked up. He’s short \nenough that he can lose defenders in traffic and come out the other side.  \nMonangai can avoid the first 1-2 penetrators in the backfield and mitigate loss. He can avoid interior and backside edge \npenetration—Monangai has strong peripheral vision and timing. He often makes the first man miss in open space.  \nElusiveness: Monangai adjusts his footwork to set up blocks at the line of scrimmage or navigate around blockers pushed \ninto the backfield early in the play.  \n\n \n103 \nHe opens his hips behind the line of scrimmage to access open creases away from penetration. Monangai also opens his \nhips at the second level and makes 90-degree turns at a high rate of speed. \nHe uses pressure cuts against downhill defenders. He also has effective small jump cuts in traffic.  \nMonangai has enough stop-start quickness to avoid safeties shooting across his legs/frame in the hole. He combines a stick \nand a head fake to bait safeties to the outside before cutting inside.  \nMonangai has a strong two-step deceleration with weight drop that can force backside pursuit to overrun its angle.  \nHe accelerates through downhill cuts from the backfield. He only needs two small steps to transition downhill from a sideline \napproach on a far-side perimeter run. With near-side transitions, he only needs one step.  \nMonangai rarely uses a spin, but he can use it to find open space after bouncing off a hit in traffic.  \nAcceleration: Monangai has the acceleration to beat a middle linebacker around the far-side corner on a designed \nperimeter run.  \nSpeed: Once he has built momentum unfettered, Monangai can hold off safeties and cornerbacks for 25-35 yards.  \nPower: Monangai gets his pads low and under linebackers when finishing runs downhill. He makes it a habit to drop his \npads as he encounters contact. He pulls through lower-body reaches and wraps from linebackers, getting his knees and feet \nhigh enough to work through the contact.  \nMonangai has good location and reach with his stiff-arm. He can put a defensive lineman on the ground when using it from \na downhill angle. He’ll generate a push as the initiator of contact against defensive ends and linebackers in a tight crease.  \nMonangai pulls through reaches and wraps and when he has downhill momentum, he can push a pile. He’s skilled at \nfinishing with his pads low and feet moving.  \nHe can work through multiple points of contact during a run if they are reaches and/or wraps, and maybe one hit.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Monangai bounces off direct shots to his chest and pads in a crease from linebackers that fill the \ngaps. He initiates collisions in the crease and pushes linebackers downhill when they wrap high.  \nMonangai can run over a defensive tackle when Monangai initiates the head-on collision with the flat-footed defender.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Monangai bounces off glancing shots to his chest and pads in a crease from defensive tackles \nand linebackers that fill the gaps and defensive backs in the open field. He’ll attack the chest of a defensive tackle coming \noff a blocker and push the defender downhill at the line of scrimmage.  \nMonangai has an effective balance-touch to work downhill through glancing shots to his legs from penetrating defensive \nlinemen in the backfield.  \nRoutes: Monangai can do more to sell his stemming of routes to the outside against inside shade coverage playing over the \ntop of him in the seam.  \nWhen facing shallow zone coverage, Monangai waits until he has cleared the buzz defender before he shows his eyes to the \nquarterback. He also tempos his breaks across the open zone.  \nHe also identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly target for the \npasser. He has some snap with his turn that he could cultivate more. He has tight turns with shallow speed outs to the flat.  \nReceiving: Monangai catches targets at chest level with underhand or overhand position, but tight to his frame. He can \nimprove his attack in these scenarios. He obeys the placement of the ball to dictate the direction of his catch and pierce \ntechnique when transitioning from receiver to runner.  \nBlocking: Monangai identifies edge pressure and slides to a spot to square the defender with feet wide and knees bent. He \ngets his hands into the chest of the opponent with his elbows bent, hands tight, and no overextension. Once Monangai \nmakes contact, he moves his feet to turn the opponent away from the quarterback.  \n\n \n104 \nMonangai will overextend when chipping a defender’s shoulders as part of a double team or taking on a defensive tackle \nwith a runway downhill. He’ll slow that defender even if backed up a few steps. He’ll also take a defensive end head-on with \na shot to the chest as the second wave of a double team and slow the defender.  \nMonangai must deliver a punch. He catches contact or extends without a strike and larger defenders have the potential to \nbeat him quickly. Or he claps or hugs with his hands. When he delivers a punch, he’s loading up and leaving his feet or \noverextending, which achieves a hard strike but leaves him off balance and makes it more difficult for him to stay with the \ndefender.  \nHe’s an effective lead blocker on Keeper plays, working to the force defender and taking the inside shoulder to turn the \nopponent outside.  \nMonangai is patient with his approach deep into the pocket as a safety blitz works down the seam toward him. When a \nsafety and a linebacker blitz the same gap, Monangai makes the wise decision of taking the defender furthest to the inside.  \nHe has missed well-disguised slot-corner blitz assignments, but in another game, he has picked up a looping slot corner \nblitz working outside-in and slid from the edge to the B Gap to push the defender across the face of the quarterback.  \nDefensive tackles who are square to Monangai can overwhelm the RB with their strength and length—even when Monangai \nhas set a good initial position. This is the case for most running backs facing defensive tackles in these situations. \nBall Security: Monangai carries the ball high to his chest and with the boundary/play-side arm. His elbow is tight to his \nside. He has 708 career touches in 4 years and 0 fumbles.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monangai’s draft capital could alter his value, but I’m anticipating he’ll be a fourth- or \nfifth-round value in fantasy drafts. He’s the second of three sleepers in the RSP’s top 15.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nGood press and Finishing pad level and acceleration \n• \nMature decision-making \n• \nWinning direct collision with a DT \n• \nSlides to opposite edge as pass blocker \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n105",
        "analysis": "Kyle Monangai is a compact, powerful running back with excellent contact balance and short-area quickness.  His game is characterized by a \"never say die\" attitude and an ability to consistently gain yards despite facing multiple defenders.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Contact Balance/Power:**  Exceptional ability to absorb hits and continue forward momentum.  He excels at finishing runs with low pad level and can even push around larger defenders.\n* **Elusiveness:**  Good feet, hip mobility, and vision allow him to navigate tight spaces, make defenders miss, and find creases in the offensive line. He's adept at using jump cuts, pressure cuts, and subtle changes in direction to create separation.\n* **Short-Area Quickness:**  Accelerates well in tight spaces, making him effective in between the tackles and on quick hitting runs.\n* **Durability and Ball Security:**  Has a strong track record with zero fumbles despite significant touches throughout his college career.\n* **Vision and Decision Making:** Shows good awareness of his blockers and the field, making smart decisions based on game situation.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Pass Protection:** This is his biggest weakness; needs significant improvement in technique and positioning to become a reliable pass blocker.\n* **Receiving:** While capable of catching the ball, he needs to improve his technique, particularly in securing the ball away from his body.\n* **Long Speed:** While not a liability, his lack of elite top-end speed limits his breakaway potential.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scout compares him to a spectrum of backs: Ray Rice (for his power and agility), Jaylen Warren (for his ability to make yards in tight spaces), and Xazavian Valladay (similar skillset in short yardage situations). The comparison to Ray Rice and Maurice Jones-Drew highlights his strength and elusiveness despite his smaller stature.  He's considered potentially the best of the recent backs in this mold (Warren, Davis) despite lacking their top speed.\n\n\n**Overall:** Monangai projects as a rotational back in the NFL, with the potential to earn a significant role if he improves his pass protection.  His skillset translates well to a committee approach where he can be a valuable asset on short-yardage situations and between-the-tackles runs.  His lack of elite speed and pass protection skills might prevent him from becoming a true workhorse back, but his toughness and ability to gain yards after contact make him a valuable asset.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB15 \nJersey: No.24 / No.2 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/208 School: Memphis / South Carolina / Newberry \nComparison Spectrum: DeAngelo Williams - - X/Devonta Freeman/Javonte Williams \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 83.1 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTennessee ‘23 \n• \nFlorida ‘23 \n• \nTexas A&M ‘23 \n• \nFSU ‘24 \n• \nTulane ‘24 \n• \nWVU ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A former Harlon Hill Trophy winner at Newberry – the FCS’s version of the Heisman (think Joique Bell) \n– Anderson is the last of the 3-4 players I have among my top-15 at the position that you’ll unlikely see anywhere else. \nAnderson might be one of the true sleepers in this class—and my final one among the top 15.  \nThere’s also the risk that I overestimated Anderson’s acceleration and speed to the point that his value is inflated. This is \nthe risk of players who don’t go to the NFL Combine. The event isn’t a precise – or always a true indicator – of a player’s \nspeed, but it’s the third of three layers of information I use to gauge a player’s speed.  \nThe NFL Combine and field tracking of runs in miles per hour are two of the traditional data points. The third is the RSP’s \nchecklist that tracks the type of runs that earn separation, the path of the run, and the defenders with viable angles they \nbeat.  \nWhen studying Anderson’s work from the past two seasons, the checklist and field tracking show indications of starter \nacceleration and long speed. Several of Anderson’s runs beat SEC-level cornerbacks and safeties and earned mile-per-hour \nreadings commensurate with high-end NFL contributors whose speed isn’t called into question.  \nAnderson’s game stood out to me immediately in the same way Chris Brooks and Isaiah Pacheco’s in recent years. After I \nfinished my charting, I realized he wasn’t considered a strong prospect but like Brooks and Pacheco, I’m less inclined to \nbelieve I’m missing as much as my peers.  \nAnderson manages risk well. He’ll take risks that don’t work, but he doesn’t take them in areas of the field or down and \ndistance situations where he disables his team’s playbook. He’s a refined cutback runner who executes all forms of zone \nblocking effectively.  \nAnderson has sharp footwork – lateral cuts, transitions downhill from perimeter runways, and jukes. He also gets his feet \nover shots and times hurdles over defenders when necessary.  \nAnderson’s not just a mover. He has a low center of gravity and routinely forces gang tackles after a box defender earns the \nfirst contact.  \nAnderson wins collisions with linebackers and safeties. He is not a runner who goes down easily, and he has enough runs \nwhere he works through multiple reaches, wraps, and/or hits to prove it.  \nAnderson is also a viable outlet receiver, but has lapses with clap-attacks he must address, even if he’s had good results \nthus far. He finds open space with his routes and adjusts with the quarterback when forced off script.  \nAnderson’s pass protection is among the most promising in this class. When he learns to strike, he could be an elite pass \nprotector. He picks up a variety of blitzes and two-man games as well as multiple pressures in his gap.  \nAnderson’s ball security is among the best in this class – 1 fumble in 474 touches in Division-I football. If I’m correct about \nAnderson, he’s one of the most versatile backs in this class.  \nWhat I haven’t shared with you is that I’m concerned I underestimated his scores for vision, acceleration, and power. If I \nhave, Anderson could be one of the biggest surprises of what’s considered a strong RB class.  \n\n \n106 \nVision: Anderson identifies edge penetration and works around it. He’s an accomplished cutback runner on outside, inside, \nand mid-zone. He presses within 1-2 steps of blockers/defenders and then makes the cutback.  \nAnderson is a wise cutback runner who doesn’t get too aggressive about bouncing the cutback too wide. He finds the next \navailable crease or cuts back into the next available crease if containment cuts off the path to the open flat or sideline.  \nAnderson takes what he can get with the play design on gap plays versus multiple points of interior penetration into the \nbackfield. When running zone, Anderson has tried to bounce plays outside when the inside leverage and push dictated \ntaking what was available with the interior gaps. Anderson didn’t take these chances in unfavorable down, distance, or \ngame script situations. Anderson does well to press inside gaps on designed perimeter plays.  \nElusiveness: Anderson only needs two quick steps to transition downhill when working to the short side perimeter. He can \nalso jump cut out of the transition.  \nAnderson has sharp pressure cuts. He gets his feet high to work over shots/reaches to his lower legs. Anderson opens his \nhips into pressure cuts downhill and can get sharp dips away from edge containment bearing down on him.  \nHe has a good outside stick that he pairs with an inside spin that can elude two defensive backs in the flat. His spin is a \ntight move.  \nAnderson times hurdles of low shots from safeties effectively. He eludes defenders in succession with different moves.  \nAnderson adjusts his stride length to set up blocks. He’ll alter is pacing to set up linebackers with angles as they shoot gaps. \nAnderson drops his weight effectively so he can decelerate and cut downhill.  \nAcceleration: Anderson has the acceleration to get through the line of scrimmage past defensive linemen, linebackers, and \ndefensive backs. He can accelerate past safeties to the far sideline on wide routes.  \nSpeed: When Anderson earns momentum downhill, he can outrun safeties and cornerbacks in the open field for spans of \n60-75 yards, if not longer. He’s fast enough that defensive backs can’t make up ground on him if he beats them during the \ninitial acceleration phase of the run.  \nPower: He keeps his feet moving when linebackers wrap him at the waist. When wrapped high—even by defensive \nlinemen—Anderson forces gang tackles. He keeps his feet moving for extra yardage.  \nHe pulls through reaches from defensive linemen. Anderson drops his pads into oncoming contact and can work over the top \nof the collision for yards downhill or bounce off the hit entirely.  \nHenderson wards of reaches with a stiff arm. He’ll bounce off multiple points of contact on some runs, such as a hit and \nthen a reach in succession.  \nDirect Contact Balance: When Anderson has momentum downhill, he’ll bounce off direct shots to his pads from \nlinebackers coming downhill. He’ll drop a linebacker on his backside and force the defender to wrap low.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Anderson bounces of glancing shots to his legs from linebackers in the crease and glancing \nshots to his pads and chest from defensive tackles.  \nRoutes: When running routes against zone coverage, Anderson identifies the second-level defenders, works to depth, and \nthen tempos his breaks between the defenders. Anderson waits to clear the buzz/rollover defender before he shows his eyes \nto the quarterback. \nReceiving: Anderson tracks the ball over his shoulder to the flat. He extends his arms from his frame and uses overhand \nposition to catch the ball. His hands can be tighter so he has no incidents of clapping and/or juggling the target.  \nWhen the ball arrives on the numbers, Anderson has lapses where he claps high-low rather than using uniform position. He \nalso has lapses where he lets the ball into his frame and it leads to fighting the ball. However, Anderson can use underhand \nposition with his arms away from his frame and hands tight to the ball.  \nBlocking: As an open-field blocker, Anderson maintains a square stance to the defender. His hands are tight enough into \nthe chest of the defender. He keeps his frame squat with his legs apart. This is also true of stand-up pass protection against \ninterior pressure. He’ll also run his feet and maintain position to move the defender away from the pocket.  \n\n \n107 \nAnderson identifies edge pressure while executing play fakes but can be too deep into the crease to get wide enough to cut \nthe opponent. He picks up A-Gap pressure and earns good depth in the pocket to do it.  \nWhen cutting A-Gap pressure, Anderson has good timing, shoots high and through the opponent and gets across the frame \nof the opponent. When cutting edge pressure he can drop his head and his cuts wind up too low.  \nAnderson delivers aggressive chips during chip-releases, but shows the judgement to modify the intensity of the strike when \nhis teammate has position on the defender. When the chip is on an unblocked defender, Anderson hits hard.  \nAnderson spots cross-blitzing linebackers and moves efficiently to square a strike each—leading one into a teammate and \nthen fanning out to take on the second option.  \nHis feet are quick enough that he can laterally slide with edge defenders to wall them off from the quarterback—even when \nhe’s picking up the DE after the DE beat the LT.  \nAnderson delivers an uppercut into a twisting defensive end, but he can miss-time the punch. He gets struck first into his \nframe and knocked backward.  \nHe handles all three levels of defenders competently as a stand-up blocker. When he learns to strike, he could be an elite \npass protector. He picks up a variety of blitzes and two-man games as well as multiple pressures in his gap.  \nAnderson has lapses where he catches contact against defenders with more downhill momentum and this pushes him \nbackward.  \nBall Security: Anderson carries the ball high to his chest. He can take contact to the ball-carrying arm. He has 1 fumble in \n165 career touches in 2023 at South Carolina. In Division-I football, Anderson has 1 fumble in 454 touches. At Newberry he \nhad 533 touches but couldn’t find data on fumbles. \nThe ball can hang too low from his chest when in the open field.

        "analysis": "Mario Anderson is a versatile running back prospect with high upside, but also some risk due to his lack of high-level competition and absence from the NFL Combine.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:** Possesses excellent footwork, sharp cuts, and the ability to elude multiple defenders in succession using a variety of moves (including spins and hurdles).  He shows an understanding of leverage and uses subtle changes in pace to create openings.\n* **Powerful Runner:**  Despite not being exceptionally large, Anderson displays surprising power, consistently forcing missed tackles and breaking through contact.  He maintains balance well, even when taking direct hits.\n* **Vision & Cutback Ability:**  Displays good vision, identifying and effectively exploiting cutback lanes.  He's smart about when to take risks and when to play it safe.\n* **Pass Protection:**  Shows exceptional promise as a pass protector, already capable of handling various blitzes and pressures.  His potential here is considered elite once he refines his striking technique.\n* **Receiving:** A capable pass-catching back, able to find open space and adjust to off-script throws.  While he needs to improve his catching technique (reducing \"clapping\"), his route running is solid.\n* **Ball Security:**  Exceptional ball security, with only one fumble in 474 career touches at the Division I level.\n* **Durability:** No significant injury history.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Receiving Technique:** While a capable receiver, refining his hand-eye coordination and reducing \"clapping\" will elevate his overall receiving skill.\n* **Refine Pass Protection Striking:** While already good, perfecting his striking technique in pass protection will unlock his elite potential in this area.\n* **Prove Speed/Acceleration at Higher Level:**  The scout acknowledges concern about overestimating his speed and acceleration, as he didn't participate in the combine.  Performing well at the next level will confirm this aspect of his game.\n* **Increased Competition:**  His college career wasn't at the highest level of competition, so adapting to the NFL's speed and complexity will be crucial.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scout compares Anderson to DeAngelo Williams, Devonta Freeman, and Javonte Williams.  This suggests a player who blends power, elusiveness, and pass-catching ability.  The DeAngelo Williams comparison highlights the power and ability to run through contact.  Devonta Freeman and Javonte Williams highlight his elusiveness and ability to create yards after contact.  The Joique Bell comparison (from his Harlon Hill Trophy days) suggests a similar build and style of versatile, productive running back who may not have the high-end athleticism to be a featured back in the NFL.\n\n\n**Overall:**  Anderson is a high-risk, high-reward prospect.  His blend of skills and strong performance in several key areas makes him an intriguing prospect, particularly as an undrafted free agent who could surprise and potentially become a valuable contributor.\n"

        "player_name": "Devin Neal",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB16 \nJersey: No.4 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/213 School: Kansas   \nComparison Spectrum: Bilal Powell - X - Ke'Shawn Vaughn \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 82.9 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTexas ‘23 \n• \nOklahoma State ’23  \n• \nKansas State ‘23 \n• \nArizona State ‘24 \n• \nIowa State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A pessimistic viewpoint on Neal – and several of the running backs in this tier – is that Neal and many \nof his peers would score at least a tier lower in the RSP’s system if they weren’t so skilled with securing the football. The \n2025 RB class collectively has the best ball security rates that I’ve seen in several years, if not ever.  \nThis alone is a reason why I’m seeing more backs with scores this tier than I usually do. Ball Security is an important a \ncategory in the RSP’s scoring system and the research supports its value. You’ll learn more about this a few reports down \nwhen you read Jaydon Blue’s.  \nStill, if you limited Neal’s ball security to a starter or contributor, his value would be 2-4 points lower on the RSP’s board \nand that’s usually where you see players who are reserves who earn touches, but the share of work is small and lacking \nstrong statistical value.  \nThe optimistic perspective is that Neal’s ball security awards him and his offense more opportunities to shine and this will \ncarry over to his NFL career. Neal is a patient runner between the tackles and in the open field.  \nNeal knows when to access cutback lanes because he’s skilled at reading pre-snap and post-snap keys. He’s a wise manager \nof situational football, knowing when to take risks based on field position.  \nMy biggest concern about Neals’ decision-making is that his usage at Kansas had a lot of perimeter runs. Still, there’s \nenough work with Duo that Neal still has a solid chance of landing somewhere with a run scheme that suits his talents.  \nOutside of an isolated scenario where he has been prone to use an elongated step that lacked efficiency, most of Neal’s \nfootwork is efficient. He also decelerates effectively and alters his stride length and pacing to set blocks and unblocked \ndefenders.  \nNeal is also a good micro-mover—using small adjustments to his frame to avoid reaches in tight creases. Ezekiel Elliot was \nfantastic at this in his prime.  \nElusiveness is his best asset against pursuit. He has functional power, but he’s not a strong tackle breaker or pile mover. If \nhe can reduce the effectiveness of a defender’s pursuit angle, Neal runs through the weakened attempt.  \nNeal tracks the ball well as a receiver and has the toughness and concentration to make difficult plays with contact \nimminent. He has late hands so trailing or tight defenders can’t time the arrival of the ball.  \nNeal’s blocking has competent moments but needs more work. He earns good position, gets his hands inside, and strikes \nwith an uppercut. He diagnoses blitzes. He gets in trouble when he’s on an island against defenders with wide rush lanes in \nthe middle of the pocket.  \nOverall, expect Neals routes and pass protection to improve. His power and athletic explosion likely won’t. This may cap him \nas a productive contributor in a committee.  \nVision: Neal is patient with pulling blockers and lead blockers on toss and fly sweeps. In the open field, Neal will press \nwithin two steps of his lead blocker while at full speed before cutting back into the crease.  \n\n \n109 \nKansas uses Neal on power sweeps, toss plays and wide zone. A lot of his runs are perimeter calls. The common inside \nrunning play at KU is Duo.  \nNeal identifies penetration into the backfield and has the footwork to adjust. When working between the tackles, Neal will \npress within a step of his linemen to set up a seal block and cut downhill.   \nHe routinely takes cutbacks on gap plays that are slow-developing to the play side edge—abandoning the play side all \ntogether by quickly cutting to the back side edge. When he does this, he has read enough keys pre-snap and early post-\nsnap to set up the cutback and earn positive yards.  \nIt’s a smart risk considering the alignment of the defense. He’ll also take what he can get in the red zone when a play \ndoesn’t unfold as he hoped early in its development.  \nElusiveness: Neal only needs two steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill path. He can get his feet \nover low shots after transitioning away from downhill pursuit. \nNeal will drop his weight into a long step that sets up a sharp pressure cut. His sharp pressure cuts can make a linebacker \nmiss in open space. \nNeal has an efficient and capable jump stop in tight traffic against interior penetration within a step of the exchange point. \nHe drops his weight into jump stops and deceleration opportunities as a ball carrier.  \nNeal will adjust his pacing to set up changes of direction in the open field. Neal can point the toe and open his hips to \nbounce away from pursuit.  \nNeal changes his stride length after the exchange to adjust to interior penetration. He also adjusts well to edge penetration \nslanting inside to the backfield. \nNeal relies too often on long-step pressure cuts against pursuit that’s arriving downhill in the open field, and it makes his \nsuccess with the most a boom-bust proposition.  \nHis stop-start movement is notable and when he’s in traffic, he often makes the first man miss and weaves his way into \nopen space. Neal has a quick double-up with his outside foot to juke defenders coming downhill for him at the edge of \nperimeter run. Neal combines the move with head and shoulder fakes.  \nNeal has a good hesitation step as well. The more he can cut down on the long-step pressure cut, the better. He was more \njudicious with this type of footwork in 2024.  \nNeal rarely uses the spin, but he is effective using it to work through contact from downhill pursuit. He has some micro-\nmovement skills to dip his side/pads/arm away from reaches at the line of scrimmage as he cuts against the grain of \npursuit.  \nAcceleration: When he has the room to build speed, he can accelerate past most box defenders and some safeties—\nespecially when working up the middle.  \nSpeed: When Neal has built momentum, he can outrun a cornerback or safety who is coming off a block and accelerating \nfrom a standstill.  \nPower: Neal keeps his feet moving when wrapped high. He’ll pull through reaches to his frame from defensive tackles. He \ndrops his pads at the end of runs to protect himself and get under hits. He’s not a violent finisher.  \nIf he’s successful with a juke, Neal’s stiff-arm works well as a follow-up to keep the defender from wrapping him.  \nHe’s not a strong pile pusher but he can generate 1-3 steps forward and some lean when in the box.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Neal can bounce off direct hits from safeties.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Neal can bounce off indirect shots to his upper body from defensive tackles. He can at least \nstalemate a hit to the torso from a linebacker working from the middle of the field to the boundary while a defensive back \nas Neal’s legs wrapped.  \n\n \n110 \nRoutes: Neal identifies the second-level defender in zone, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a turn to \nmake his body a friendly target. He’ll tempo breaks across a zone and wait to show his eyes until he has crossed the \nbuzz/rollover defender.  \nNeal has a capable two-step break off a stem selling the wheel route, but he must learn to drop his weight into the break. \nNeal has the speed to beat outside linebackers on wheel routes up the boundary.  \nReceiving: He uses underhand position to catch waist-high targets close to his frame. Neal uses overhand position to \naddress chest-high targets. He leaves his feet to catch targets just above his head. He has improved this tendency in 2024.  \nNeal obeys the direction of the target and catches and pierces downhill. He can take contact to his back as he makes the \ncatch.  \nNeal displays late hands with targets arriving above his head. He makes difficult one-handed adjustments away from his \nframe that require him reaching behind his break point or turning through his break point. He can take hard shots to his \nlegs and get flipped. He can take contact to his back as he high-points.  \nBlocking: Neal will assist with double-teams against defensive tackles. He has good bend with his elbows and keeps his \nhands tight at the strike point. When assisting defensive ends, he will earn a square position and strike the defender’s chest \nwhen the defender earns the corner early on the tackle.  \nNeal also picks up cross-blitzing linebackers—taking the initial blitzer when he gets past the center or guard and then \npeeling off the second option. Neal also picks up corner blitzes effectively.  \nNeal shuffles his feet with a wide stance and gets his knees bent. He overextends into larger defenders, but he’s tight to his \nteammate and takes the open side of the defender. He gets in trouble with A-gap pressure where the splits in the box are \nwide and he’s on an island with the defender.  \nNeal earns a square position with depth into the line against edge pressure and interior blitzes such as A-Gap blitzes from \nlinebackers. He uses an uppercut to strike, but he can cultivate more violence with it. He can shield defensive backs with it.  \nNeal has good timing with cut blocks. He earns good height and works through the frame of the opponent. He must get \nacross defenders faster when he he’s working inside-out against an edge defender.  \nBall Security: Neal carries the ball high to his chest and at full speed, he can keep his elbow tight to his side. He carries \nthe ball under his boundary-side arm. Neal has 5 fumbles in 840 touches, 1 per 168 touches. Only 2 in past 474 touches—1 \nper 237 during past two seasons.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Neal is a decent third-round pick who might fall further because his long speed is good, \nbut not great. If he earns second-day NFL Draft capital, it could change his value in rookie drafts after May. Don’t count on \nit. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSweet Suite of Movement on Perimeter Run \n• \nWise risk-taking and processing \n• \nGame management, box read, presses, cutbacks, and burst \n• \nHow he handles a mistake and knowledge of angles \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n111",
        "analysis": "Devin Neal is a running back prospect with a balanced skillset, excelling in some areas while needing improvement in others.  His greatest strength is his exceptional ball security, a trait that significantly boosts his overall ranking.  He demonstrates patience and vision, effectively reading defenses pre- and post-snap to identify cutback lanes and maximize yardage. Neal is also an elusive runner, capable of making defenders miss in tight spaces, utilizing a variety of jukes, cuts, and a hesitation step. He shows good acceleration and speed when given space to build momentum.  While not a power back, he displays functional power and decent contact balance. His receiving skills are a plus, showing good hands and the ability to make tough catches in traffic.  He displays competency in pass protection, though needs improvement in consistently handling pressure, particularly from the A-gap. His blocking requires further refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Ball Security:**  A significant asset, significantly impacting his overall projection.\n* **Vision and Patience:** Excellent at reading defenses and finding cutback lanes.\n* **Elusiveness:** Skilled at making defenders miss with various moves.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  Good hands and ability to secure tough catches.\n* **Functional Power & Contact Balance:**  Maintains balance and keeps feet moving through contact.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Pass Protection:** Needs consistency against pressure, especially up the middle.\n* **Enhance Blocking Technique:** Needs to become more physical and consistent as a blocker.\n* **Reduce Reliance on Long-Step Pressure Cuts:**  While effective at times, this move is somewhat boom-or-bust.\n* **Increase Power:** While functional, becoming a more powerful runner would greatly enhance his value.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  Bilal Powell and Ke'Shawn Vaughn offer a good range of potential outcomes.  Powell represents Neal's potential as a versatile, reliable back who excels in receiving and pass protection, while Vaughn represents a less polished runner who may struggle to consistently break tackles and gain significant yardage.  The ultimate comparison will depend on Neal's ability to improve in his weaker areas.\n"

        "player_name": "Phil Mafah",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB17 \nJersey: No.7 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/234 School: Clemson \nComparison Spectrum: James Conner – Leonard Fournette – X - A.J. Dillon \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 82.3 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nFSU ‘23 \n• \nNC State ‘23 \n• \nNotre Dame ‘23 \n• \nUGA ‘24 \n• \nFSU ‘24 \n• \nLOU ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A big runner with patience, contact balance, and elusiveness, Mafah has enough acceleration and \nspeed to become a productive contributor – maybe a starter. He has experience running a variety of blocking schemes and \nexecutes them with good decisions.  \nMafah anticipates the development of blocks and isn’t afraid to hit those creases just before the blocks open a lane. This is \nexactly what coaches want from a back, especially a big back with his acceleration and long speed. He also knows how to \nblend patience and aggression with his attack of creases.  \nMafah can play to his size, but he has lapses where his hips aren’t north south when he takes on a defender with a north-\nsouth pursuit angle. When Mafah’s pads and hips aren’t aligned, he limits his power base and loses collisions he should win.  \nWhen Mafah’s hips are aligned to his pads, he carries defenders downfield, runs through all forms of contact, and bounces \noff glancing shots from defensive linemen. If he made the effort to accelerate into contact, he could become an elite power \nback. Perhaps an aspiring Stephen Davis, a more agile and scheme versatile Leonard Fournette with better speed. Mafah \nlacks that top gear, but he has enough acceleration and long speed to flip the field and occasionally deliver a breakaway \nrun.  \nMafah has enough receiving skills to earn outlet duty: screens, check-downs, RPOs, and flat routes. If targeted in the \nvertical game, Mafah positions himself well to win jump balls.  \nMafah lapses into clap-attacks when targets force him to extend in awkward angles. His pass protection has good moments \nbecause he can strike hard enough to stand up defensive linemen.  \nThe issues outweigh the assets at this point. Mafah can be a step late to get into position, his striking needs more work, and \nhe’s often one-and-one with his interactions. Too often, he’s a 234-pound speed bump—for NFL defenders, speed bumps \nare just excuses to win with moves offensive linemen don’t fall for.  \nEven so, Mafah could contribute situationally as a rookie. If he continues refining his craft, he could earn a substantial split \nof an NFL backfield.  \nVision: Mafah is patient. He takes a slow approach toward the crease on zone runs and then accelerates through the crease \nhe identifies.  \nWhen running gap plays, Mafah attacks downhill earlier. He presses double teams on Duo effectively and then cuts downhill \ndecisively in tight traffic.  \nMafah identifies interior penetration during the exchange and finds cutbacks behind the line of scrimmage and at the second \nand third level of a defense.  \nMafah is a decisive runner with inside zone, anticipating the interior double team with good timing and aggressive downhill \nattack. Mafah reads cram, cutback, and bounce creases appropriately and with patience on outside zone.  \nElusiveness: Mafah can transition downhill with one step from a perimeter approach of a wide route or flat route. He does \nthe same with transitions downhill on perimeter runs to the near-side corner.  \n\n \n112 \nHe kicks his heels toward his backside when he passes a defender on the ground reaching for his feet.  \nMafah can layer moves in succession—for instance, transitioning downhill with one step, kicking his heels past a fallen \ndefender he leaped over, and then spinning inside pursuit arriving over the top of him.  \nMafah executes small jump cuts. He adjusts his stride length to set up blocks. He also opens his hips effectively to make \nefficient changes of direction. Mafah delivers a jump stop into a hip-opener to set up a crease outside the blocker he’s \npressing.  \nMafah can change his stride length and pace to set up blocks between the tackles.  \nAcceleration: Mafah has the acceleration to get past a safety with an angle 10 yards away from the line of scrimmage.  \nSpeed: Cornerback on the same side of the field can chase Mafah down after 30-40 yards. From the far side, a corner \nneeds about 25-30 yards if the defender has a downhill angle before he begins his pursuit.  \nPower: Mafah finishes with low pad level. He pulls through reaches from box defenders and if wrapped high, Mafah often \nforces the defense to rally to the cause and gang tackle Mafah to bring the runner to the ground.  \nMafah pulls defensive linemen downhill if they wrap high and from the side or from backside pursuit. He is a pile mover.  \nHe has a capable forearm shiver that helps him prevent safeties from hitting his frame and it sends the defenders to the \nground.  \nMafah can pull defenders along and bounce off multiple hits during the same attempt—or pull through a DL’s wrap and \nbounce off a safety’s hit when working north south. He’s easiest to wrap when working east-west.  \nDirect Contact Balance: When he drops the pads, he can knock a safety backward with a collision, even when he’s falling \nforward into the defender. He’ll meet linebackers at the end of the crease and win collisions, forcing them to wrap up.  \nWhen entering a crease Mafah loads up a shoulder, turns his hips to the sideline and plows into the unblocked linebacker’s \nchest. This turn of the pads and hips from Mafah reduces the back’s power potential and gives the defender an advantage. \nMafah can push the defender backward 2-3 steps, but if he accelerated through the defender, taking one side of the \ndefender’s chest, Mafah could get into the secondary.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Mafah bounces off glancing shots to his pads and hips from defensive linemen, linebackers, and \ndefensive backs.  \nRoutes: Mafah counters the hands of his opponents on vertical routes with a shed or a wipe. \nAgainst zone coverage, Mafah identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He \ncreates a friendly target.  \nReceiving: Mafah extends to the earliest point to catch targets over his shoulder arriving above his head. He keeps his feet \non the ground until his reach needs him to go airborne.  \nHe practices effective catch and pierce principles to get downhill. He has a tendency to clap-attack high targets and that \nleads to fighting the ball unnecessarily.  \nMafah makes back-shoulder catches on wheel routes. He can use underhand position at the beltline. He can take contact to \nhis back and maintain possession of the ball. He also pulls the ball away from the oncoming defender.  \nWhen Mafah has lapses with his attack, he clap-attacks targets. This happens with targets below his waist and near his \nknees at trajectories that aren’t pinpoint. He also leaves his feet unnecessarily for targets at his shoulders and uses \nunderhand position when he could attack earlier with overhand position.  \nBlocking: Mafah identifies edge pressure pre-snap. He earns a square position with good bend of his knees and hips to \nprepare for a stride. His elbows are bent and he aims for the opponent’s breastplate. He keeps his hands tight and delivers \na hard uppercut strike. \n\n \n113 \nMafah overextends with his strikes, which could become problematic against larger defenders who are more accomplished in \nthe NFL. Savvy edge rushers have ripped Mafah aside and gotten hits on Clemson’s quarterback because Mafah’s \noverextension left him out of position to handle quick and powerful redirects.  \nHe has enough pop to slow a defensive lineman, but his technique isn’t complete enough to win consistently against them \nor accomplished LBs. When his strike method doesn’t take him out of position with the opponent, Mafah moves his feet after \nthe initial contact.  \nMafah identifies interior pressure, works to depth in the pocket, squares the opponent, and cuts across the opponent’s legs \nwith good timing. He can shoot a little too low against edge pressure that takes a wide route to the pocket.  \nHe’ll identify cross blitzing linebackers through A-Gaps but can identify too late to square the opponent and his strike \ndoesn’t deter the defender from his path to the quarterback.  \nBall Security: Mafah carries the ball high to his chest and under his boundary-side arm. His elbow is a loose from his side \nand this gives defenders an area to attack the ball. Mafah has 1 fumble per 90.25 touches. He has 4 in 361 touches—3 of \nthem in 200 touches – in 2023.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I’m betting Mafah will have third-round value in many rookie drafts before the NFL’s \nselection process. He’s a high-floor option with enough of a ceiling to become a contributor that he’s worth your \nconsideration than most of the backs with a similar grade.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHands, transitions, footwork, and dynamic movement \n• \nSetup of crease, forearm shiver, acceleration \n• \nPress and speed \n• \nIDs run blitz, presses toward it, and makes two LBs miss in succession \n• \nUnaligned power base on a north-south run \n• \nAligned power base on a north-south run \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n114",
        "analysis": "Phil Mafah is a powerful, versatile running back with a high floor but a somewhat limited ceiling.  He's projected as a rotational starter in the NFL, capable of contributing immediately but needing refinement to reach elite status.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Patience:**  Excellent at identifying creases and patiently waiting for blocks to develop before accelerating.  Displays good vision both inside and outside zone runs.\n* **Contact Balance & Power:**  Exceptional contact balance, consistently pushing through tackles and dragging defenders.  Possesses significant power, capable of moving piles and winning collisions.  Effective forearm shiver helps him shed tacklers.\n* **Elusiveness:** While not a burner, Mafah shows surprising agility and ability to make defenders miss in tight spaces.  He can chain together multiple moves effectively.\n* **Receiving Skills:**  Functional receiver capable of contributing in the passing game, particularly on screens, checkdowns, and short routes.  Shows potential to win jump balls.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Technique:** Refining his pad level and hip alignment on contact would significantly increase his power and efficiency.  Improving his pass protection technique (reducing overextension) would enhance his overall value.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumbling rate isn't alarming, reducing it would build trust and increase his playing time.\n* **Acceleration/Top-End Speed:** Though adequate, boosting his top-end speed could unlock even greater potential as a breakaway runner.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided (James Conner, Leonard Fournette, A.J. Dillon) accurately captures his strengths.  He lacks Fournette's elite speed and agility, but shares his power and versatility. He possesses Conner's power and ability to be a three-down back (though his pass protection needs work), and also has some similarities to Dillon in his physical running style.  The mention of Stephen Davis suggests a player with power, agility, and scheme versatility, which is a reasonable long-term aspiration.  However, achieving that level requires significant improvement in technique and consistency.\n\n**Overall:** Mafah projects as a valuable late-round draft pick with a chance to become a productive NFL player. His immediate impact will likely depend on his ability to improve his technical flaws and solidify his role.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB18 \nJersey: No.33 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/200 School: VaTech/NC A&T \nComparison Spectrum: Marshall Faulk - Charlie Garner/Jahmyr Gibbs - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 82.1 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nMarshall’23 \n• \nPitt ‘23 \n• \nFSU ‘23 \n• \nVanderbilt ‘24 \n• \nMiami ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: If Tuten goes to a gap-heavy scheme, he can deliver starter production as long as he holds onto the \nball. If he’s asked to run inside zone, he’s going to need further development before he can become a reliable decision-\nmaker. Outside zone is a little better, but he’s prone to bouncing a lot of runs—and he gets outside way too early, inviting \nideal angles for pursuit to limit plays.  \nBall security will be one of the most important things for Tuten to fix. As I detail with Jaydon Blue, who is the next back \nbehind Tuten on the RSP’s board, backs who fall below 1 fumble per 61 touches in college football rarely deliver starter \nproduction in the NFL in recent years.  \nTuten’s ball security rate is 1 fumble per 67 touches and of his 11 fumbles in 737 touches, Tuten has fumbled 9 times \nduring the past 2 years. He’s fast, he’s a confident tight-crease runner, and he’s physical for his size.  \nIf Tuten can curtail his fumbling, he could become a slightly bigger version of Charlie Garner. If you never saw Garner, he \nwould have been an even more devastating weapon in today’s NFL.  \nIf Tuten can’t address the issue, he might wind up a career reserve with situational value, at best. At worst, he might not \neven be in the league.  \nWith Tuten’s speed, there’s a good chance that he’ll earn draft capital that gives him the opportunity to compete for early \nplaying time. While fumbling can make coaches turtle faster than a bath in the Arctic Circle, they’re more apt to give an \nearly-round rookie at least twice the chances they’d give a late round option. Add that up and it still doesn’t amount to \nmuch.  \nVision: Tuten is decisive through open creases. He reads penetration during the exchange and has the quickness of mind to \nmake one move or set up moves to avoid the defender. \nHe’s a confident tight-crease runner on Duo. On perimeter runs, Tuten will press inside-out to set up the perimeter blocks.  \nTuten needs work with inside zone. He ignores the leverage that will lead him through a crease in short yardage, opting for \na riskier cut back. Tuten does this in down and distance situations that aren’t wise.  \nTuten also ignores advantageous double teams because he’s running to open space instead of setting up the play design. \nThis is also the case with blocks with outside zone. This makes him a boom-bust decision-maker with zone plays between \nthe tackles.  \nTuten has an easier time with outside zone because the decision opportunities present themselves with greater space and \ntime to navigate than inside zone.  \nElusiveness: Tuten has a capable stick that leads into a jump cut to work laterally across the face of a penetrating \ndefender. Tuten can change pace and get his feet and knees high to step over shots to his lower legs. He’ll spin through \nwraps to his upper body when he has room to keep his feet moving. Tuten has timely pressure cuts to dip inside edge \ncontainment as he reaches the edge of the box on a perimeter run or bounce outside. Tuten has a good double-up.  \nTuten only needs 1-2 steps to transition downhill on a perimeter run to the far side or near side. When taking either corner-\nshort or long, he often only needs one step. Tuten can open his hips efficiently with one step.  \n\n \n115 \nTuten has a good head fake to set up a bounce outside pursuit in space.  \nAcceleration: Tuten has the acceleration to reach the secondary with runs up the middle and off tackle to the near side of \nthe field. He can beat a cornerback around the far-side edge or short-side edge on a bounce-out.  \nSpeed: Tuten can pull away from safeties in the open field.   \nPower: In the open field, Tuten initiates contact with his pads and/or forearm to finish plays against defenders shooting for \nTuten’s legs. He runs through reaches to his upper body and forces defensive backs to slide down his frame and wrap up.  \nWhen working between the tackles, Tuten keeps his pads low with a good body lean. He pulls through reaches to his upper \nbody from box defenders and keeps his feet moving through wraps to his upper body.  \nTuten can run through multiple reaches and/or reaches and hits during a carry. He can push a pile and drag defenders.   \nTuten has good placement with his stiff-arm but he can time the delivery earlier in the open field. Between the tackles \nTuten uses it well to swat reaches from defensive linemen so he can clear the crease.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Tuten can run over the safety or linebacker when colliding with a downhill track.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Tuten drops his pads into oncoming defensive backs and knocks them off path at the collision \npoint. He bounces of glancing shots to his upper body from linebackers in the crease. He can take a hard glancing shot to \nhis chest in the backfield from a wide nine defensive end maintain his balance.  \nRoutes: When facing off-coverage as a detached receiver, Tuten plays with pacing to set up stems. He has a good break \nstep and drops his weight quickly and deeply to decelerate quickly. When his quarterback breaks the pocket, Tuten works to \nthe open area on the scramble drill and shows his eyes once he settles into the open zone. \nHis speed turns on inside breaks can be unstable with the instep and it leads to slipping.  \nReceiving: Tuten tracks the ball over his shoulder with arms extended and with overhand position on wide routes at the \nearliest window. When attacking the target arriving above his helmet, Tuten extends for the ball without leaving his feet. He \nextends away from his frame effectively.  \nTuten transitions downhill with good catch-and-pierce principles. He does this well out of a high-point on the move. He’ll \nalso obey the ball when it’s thrown to his back hip and turn inside with his catch and pierce.  \nWhen he has occasional lapses as a receiver, the five I saw over the past two years were mostly targets over his head at \nodd angles and a pair of focus drops.  \nTuten can take hits to his chest and frame on leak routes as he catches the ball.  \nHe’s used mostly on leak routes, wide routes, RPOs, and screens. He will work downfield on a scramble drill and can win the \nball on these vertical targets over his shoulder.  \nBlocking: Tuten earns a tight position to the defender, taking the air out of the distance between them. He shuffles his feet \nwell from a squat position to work laterally across the pocket. He delivers his arms with elbows bent and hands tight when \nusing an uppercut punch.  \nOnce he makes contact, he can move his feet and turn the defender away from the pocket—sustaining the effort.  \nTuten aims for the chest plate of the defender and doesn’t overextend, unless he’s trying to roll through his hips during the \npunch. In that case, Tuten leans too far forward to begin the process. He routinely stones linebackers and safeties with long \nrunways blitzing into interior gaps.  \nTuten can be late to identify B- and C-Gap blitzes from linebackers and it costs him position to square the defender, missing \nthe assignment.  \nI watched over 75 pass protection assignments from Tuten over the past two years, and he never attempted a cut block.  \n\n \n116 \nBall Security: Tuten carries the ball close to his chest with the boundary-side arm. The ball swings from his elbow which \ncomes loose from his side. Tuten has 737 touches in four seasons with 11 fumbles, including 9 in the past two years —1 per \n67 security rate.  \nTuten is vulnerable to losing the ball when a defender rakes across his ball-carrying arm.  \nDurability: Has a brace on his left knee in 2024.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Tuten is a high-risk, high-reward fantasy prospect because of the fumbling. Although his \nrate of fumbles is just above the acceptable baseline, I’d bet if the research I shared in the next scouting report was on a \nsliding continuum, Tuten would be in that high-risk category for never realizing his NFL potential.  \n \nTuten is a good runner and an explosive athlete, but considering the circumstances, I’d rather take him at a value relative \nto his average draft position – in early fantasy drafts and drafts after the NFL Draft. Any pick before the fourth round is risky \nfor Tuten – even if he has early second-round ability.  \n \nThe argument for Tuten bucking the odds is in the Jaydon Blue scouting report below.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBhayshul Tuten Highpoint and Tracking \n• \nContact balance and acceleration to short edge \n• \nContact balance vs LB \n• \nContact balance in backfield vs DE \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n117",
        "analysis": "Bhayshul Tuten is a high-risk, high-reward running back prospect.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Explosive Athlete:** Possesses excellent speed and acceleration, capable of reaching the secondary quickly and pulling away from safeties in the open field.  He excels at bouncing runs outside.\n* **Powerful Runner:**  Physical for his size, runs through contact, and can drag defenders.  Effective at initiating contact with his pads and finishing plays.  Good stiff arm, especially between the tackles.\n* **Elusive:** Shows good elusiveness with a capable stick, jump cut, and spin move.  Able to change pace effectively and avoid tackles.\n* **Decisive Runner (in certain situations):**  Excellent vision and decisiveness in open creases and gap-heavy schemes.  Confident tight-crease runner.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  Solid pass-catching skills, tracks the ball well over his shoulder, and displays good catch-and-pierce ability.  Effective on leak routes, wide routes, RPOs, and screens.  Can win vertical targets.\n* **Pass Blocking:**  Effective pass blocker, earns tight positions, and sustains effort. Stones linebackers and safeties.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Vision in Zone Runs:** Needs significant improvement in reading and executing inside zone plays.  Often ignores advantageous blocking schemes in favor of riskier cuts.\n* **Ball Security:** This is his biggest weakness. His high fumble rate (1 per 67 touches) is a major concern and could severely limit his NFL potential.  He needs to significantly improve his ball security to reach his full potential.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **High-End (If he fixes fumbling):**  Marshall Faulk (a comparison that acknowledges his all-around ability if his ball security is fixed) and Charlie Garner (a more realistic comparison, emphasizing his speed and elusiveness).\n* **Mid-Range (if fumbling is not fixed):**  A rotational back or situational player with limited opportunity. There's also the risk of him not even making a roster.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nTuten has the athleticism and skill set to be a successful NFL running back, but his fumbling issues are a major red flag.  If he can dramatically improve his ball security, he could become a valuable asset.  However, failure to address this will likely limit him to a backup role at best, or even prevent him from making an NFL roster.  His draft position will be heavily influenced by teams' confidence in his ability to correct his fumbling problem.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB19 \nJersey No. 23 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/196 School: Texas \nComparison Spectrum: Austin Ekeler-Jaydon Blue- - -Bernard Scott \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 81.5 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nMichigan ‘24 \n• \nLouisiana-Monroe ‘24 \n• \nKentucky ‘24 \n• \nClemson ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Blue’s evaluation comes down to his ball security. He has 6 fumbles in 274 career touches – 4 of them \ncame this year on 174 touches. His rate is 1 fumble per 45.5 touches.  \nBased on the past six years of RSP data and their resulting statistical production at the running back position in the NFL, \nrunning backs whose college ball security rate fell below 1 fumble per 61 touches were not productive pros.  \nOnly 10 percent of the running backs whose college ball security fell below this rate earned production among the top-60 \nproducers at the position in any of those six seasons. Only three percent earned top-12 production.  \nIt’s potential death knell for Blue, because it’s uncommon for prospects – no matter how talented – for them to overcome \nthis issue. That said, Sony Michel is a good example of one who did. Just from anecdotal observation, I bet as I delve into \nthis research more, most of the backs who fell below this college rate of ball security weren’t top prospects and the ones \nthat were had a higher rate of success.  \nRegardless, it’s vital for Blue to address his issue. If he does, he has the tools to become a lead back, if not an every-down \nstarter. If his ball security rate was starter-caliber right now, Blue would have been among the top five runners in this class.  \nAlthough he has seen limited work, Blue opted for the NFL. It’s an indication that he got positive feedback from the NFL \nabout the potential decision.  \nThe film supports it. Blue is a good decision-maker with game-breaking speed, strong receiving skills, and good contact \nbalance and power for his current size. Blue incorporates patient-but-sudden move to set up routes and that detail with the \nroutes I’ve seen gives him promise to develop into a strong passing-down weapon.  \nIt’s a sizable “if” for Blue to overcome his ball-security woes, but if he does, he could fit into an offense seeking a player \nwith qualities that could remind some of Austin Ekeler. That is, if Ekeler had Blue’s speed.  \nVision: Blue can press within two steps of the line to set up an open crease 1-2 gaps away from the press. He has  plays \nwhere he presses the line within a step but he also has plays where he doesn’t work close enough to the line before he \nchanges direction. \nHe can give a slight dip or fake with his pads and shoulders to hold pursuit to one side so he creates enough space to \nsqueeze through a tight crease. He’s decisive through these creases.  \nBlue reads leverage well as he works behind two pulling linemen. He identifies when the front-side puller is heading to a \nclosed off area and transitions to set up the backside puller so he can access the open crease. When he is heading in the \nsame direction is his puller(s), Blue can stick tight to the puller’s side as he passes the blocker through the crease. This \nmaximizes the space between him and pursuit from the outside—working inside.  \nHe’s mature about his decision-making in short-yardage and red-zone situations.  \nBlue identifies interior penetration during the exchange and can make an efficient cut downhill, opening his hips with the \npoint of the toe 90 degrees to get inside the penetrating defender. If he used the same technique when attempting to \nbounce a play outside, he’d be more efficient and have better balance (see Elusiveness). \n\n \n118 \nBlue is efficient in the open field and has success setting up defenders over the top with a patient approach before making \none cut.  \nElusiveness: Blue adjusts stride length and pace to set up blocks and make defenders miss in the crease. He does this well \non perimeter runs, selling the potential cut downhill through an inside crease before continuing his path to the edge.  \nHe attempts to spin through wraps to his frame. Blue has a capable stick in the open field to avoid pursuit over the top of \nhim.   \nBlue only needs two short transition steps to work from a perimeter track to a downhill track when working to the near or \nfar-side hash. He can avoid most of the contact of a cornerback and linebacker in pursuit. He only needs one step to the \nnear-side hash with some perimeter runs.  \nBlue has a sharp pressure cut away from a linebacker in the second level after he transition downhill from a perimeter \napproach.  \nBlue gets his feet over low shots to at least gain more yardage falling forward than he would otherwise. He can also hurdle \nlow shots.  \nBlue must work on opening his hips to make cuts across the line of scrimmage when tight to the line. He tries to angle his \nplant foot inside his frame and the angle is too narrow to support his weight. This leads to him slipping. In these cases, he’d \nbe better off taking a wide step with the toe pointed to the boundary and his foot and knee at least shoulder width if not \nwider. Right now, he plants his foot inside his shoulder and extends it outward.  \nBlue can open his hips when transitioning from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway as an efficient way to avoid \npursuit.  \nBlue is more effective setting up cuts after pressing a crease within a step of his blockers when he finishes his approach \nwith a jump stop and changes directions off that move.  \nHe can use a juke in the open field – a hip shift – to set up a safety or linebacker at the second level and limit the pursuit \nangle to a weak reach that before the move could have been a solid wrap up. Blue also has an effective two-quick and he \ncan make two defenders with downhill angles miss with the one move.  \nAnother open-field juke of note is Blue’s double up to set up inside pursuit and freeze it before working outside. He has an \nexcellent stutter against a defender on an island. In the open field with a one-on-one, Blue can use moves in succession to \nbeat a defender in the flat.  \nAcceleration: Blue has the acceleration to take a toss to the perimeter and get around the corner past box defenders. If he \ncuts downhill early and builds speed, he can accelerate past a Cover-2 safety up the short-side boundary.  \nSpeed: When he gets an early runway to the second-level, Blue can beat safeties and corners as he gets to the boundary \nand works up the sideline. He has borderline breakaway speed.  \nPower: Blue keeps his feet moving through wraps to his torso. He pulls through reaches to his lower legs. He has an \neffective forearm shiver after contact. He keeps his feet through contact and his pad level is low. He runs through reaches \nto his upper and lower body.  \nHe rarely used the stiff arm at Texas, but when he did, he displayed timing and location after getting a defender off-balance \nwith a move.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Blue can drop his pads into a linebacker at the other side of a crease and knock the opponent to \nthe ground with the help of a forearm shiver to clean up the collision. He can do the same with a defensive back when he \nturns downhill after turning the corner on a perimeter run.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Blue has an effective balance-touch to right himself after a hit, reach, or wrap knocks him off \nbalance. He bounces off glancing shots from linebackers in tight creases.  \nRoutes: Blue identifies the second-level of the defense, works to depth, and breaks across the zone with good tempo to \nstretch out his time in the open area. He doesn’t show his eyes until he passes the buzz/rollover defender.  \n\n \n119 \nHe’s aware of the boundary and will tap and drag to remain in bounds after a high-point. He can also tap his feet inbounds \nbacking toward the boundary against tight coverage.  \nBlue has an effective hip shift on Texas routes against flat defenders. He’s patient and sudden with the move.  \nHe works with his quarterback when the first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nReceiving: Blue tracks the ball over his shoulder. He can catch the ball at his back shoulder at chest-height or shoulder \nheight with overhand position. He can track also over his shoulder with underhand position.  \nHe keeps his feet on the ground for targets that shouldn’t force him to leave his feet.  \nBlue catches and pierces downhill after catching at target breaking toward the boundary. He high-points the ball effectively.  \nBlue can take a hard hit to the back and hang onto the ball. He can turn through the catch and point and take a hit to his \nchest. Blue can turn against the grain of his break and catch targets at helmet level and waist level.  \nBlue will extend away from his frame with underhand position, but he must focus, watch the ball into his hand, and look the \nball into his body. He has had focus drops trying to turn downfield before he has secured the target.  \nBlocking: Blue identifies linebackers who loop to the edge on a blitz after beginning with a pre-snap alignment in the \nopposite A-Gap. He also identifies E-T twists. Blue earns a squat position, slides across the formation, and squares the \ndefender. He gets his hands tight, and shoots into the defender’s chest with elbows bent.  \nBlue doesn’t close the gap enough with the assignment and overextends his frame as he shoots his hands. It prevents him \nfrom delivering with the full power that an uppercut motion could have and he takes him off-balance. He’s better timing his \npunch as a lead blocker. He can punch and turn outside linebackers.  \nThere are reps where Blue times his punch perfectly as a pass protector, and the strike is good enough to compensate for \nthe overextension. When this happens, he can stop a blitzing linebacker through interior gaps.  \nThe same is true with blitzing corners and his punch is enough against a smaller defender that he can run his feet and stay \nwith the defender to shield him from the quarterback. Blue is quick enough to pick up corner blitzes, shuffling his feet to \nmove laterally with the defender’s inside shoulder. He makes contact and continues running the defender outside the \npocket.  \nBlue will work tight to a double team so he can seal the edge from an edge pressure. He chips defensive tackles when \nworking inside as part of a double team with interior linemen.  \nBlue can overset against edge pressure and get swiped outside with a defender’s counter. This allows the defender an easy \nlane inside. Blue would have been better to maintain inside position and force the edge defender to work outside Blue.  \nBall Security: Blue secures the ball high to his chest. His elbow is too wide from his frame and it gets wider when fighting \nthrough a tackle attempt. Blue uses his boundary-side arm. The wide elbow makes Blue vulnerable to chops and punch outs \nfrom pursuit. He can handle pulling to the ball-carrying arm.  \nBlue has 6 fumbles in 273 touches over a 3-year career with Texas – 1 per 45.5 touches. He has 176 of those touches this \nyear with 4 of those fumbles.  \nDurability: No significant injuries beyond a sprained ankle that cost him a game in 2024.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Blue’s 40-Yard Dash performance at the NFL Combine will increase his draft capital. It \nwouldn’t surprise if he’s picked late-Day 2 or early-Day 3 in the NFL Draft. Before the NFL determines Blue’s draft capital, \nyou might still have a shot at him in the fourth – maybe later.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFootwork and Cutting – Balance Issues \n• \nHip-opener to avoid DT in backfield and two-quick juke vs downhill pursuit \n• \nScreen, contact balance, and aggressive running \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n\n \n120",
        "analysis": "Jaydon Blue is an intriguing NFL prospect with high-end potential but a significant concern: ball security.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:** Possesses excellent vision, making decisive cuts and utilizing effective jukes and changes of pace to evade tackles.  He's particularly adept at setting up defenders in the open field and using patient approaches before making one decisive cut.  Excels at adjusting stride length and pace to create space.\n* **Receiving Skills:** Shows promise as a pass-catching back, demonstrating the ability to track the ball well, high-point catches, and secure the ball even under duress.  He's patient and sudden in his route running.\n* **Speed and Acceleration:** Has breakaway speed and the acceleration to make big plays, particularly on perimeter runs.\n* **Contact Balance & Power:**  Maintains balance through contact, runs through tackles, and demonstrates surprising power for his size. He effectively uses forearm shivers to break tackles.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a blocker, identifying blitzes and executing effective blocks, although consistency needs improvement.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Ball Security:**  This is the biggest opportunity and arguably the biggest question mark.  His fumble rate is significantly higher than the threshold for NFL success at the RB position.  Improvement in this area could catapult him up draft boards.\n* **Refinement of Technique:**  While naturally talented, refining his cutting technique (particularly opening his hips more effectively) would significantly improve his efficiency and reduce the risk of fumbles.  Similarly, improving his blocking consistency will increase his overall value.\n* **Increased Workload:**  He’s proven his potential, but a higher volume of touches in college or NFL pre-season could show NFL scouts more consistent production and help cement his place in an NFL offense.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison to Austin Ekeler is apt, highlighting Blue's receiving ability and elusiveness. However, Ekeler is a much more polished ball carrier.  The comparison also includes Bernard Scott, suggesting a potential path as a rotational player,  but with the caveat that his ball security issues need to be addressed before reaching that potential.  The comparison spectrum acknowledges that his success is highly dependent on addressing his ball security.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nJaydon Blue has the potential to be a valuable NFL back, particularly in a scheme that utilizes his receiving skills. However, his future hinges entirely on drastically improving his ball security.  Until that happens, his draft stock and ultimate NFL success remain highly uncertain.  His NFL Combine performance will be crucial in determining his draft position, possibly landing him late Day 2 or early Day 3.\n"

        "player_name": "Jarquez Hunter",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB20 \nJersey: No.27 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/204 School: Auburn  \nComparison Spectrum: J.K. Dobbins - Khalil Herbert/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 81 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nGeorgia ‘23 \n• \nOle Miss ‘23 \n• \nAlabama ‘23 \n• \nUGA ‘24 \n• \nKentucky ‘24 \n• \nAlabama ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Physically, Hunter has the skills of a good NFL starter. He’s quick, accelerates notably well, and he has \ntop-end speed. Hunter also drops his weight effectively so he can decelerate, and he has hip mobility to execute efficient \n90-degree turns.  \nIf that’s not enough, Hunter is a determined, hard-charging runner with a powerful stiff arm and the functional strength to \ntake defenders for a ride who wrap him high. He’ll at least stalemate all three levels of defenders in a collision, often \nworking through or bouncing off linebackers and safeties.  \nHunter is an exciting college back who sees the field well in most situations. He manages situational football effectively \nwhen he has the ball in his hands, limiting risks that can take his offense out of ideal down-and-distance situations.  \nWhere his game needs refinement begins with advanced decision-making between the tackles. His decisiveness as a gap \nrunner wanes when the crease is tight, and he tries bounces and cutbacks that aren’t wise.  \nInterior penetration is also a difficult problem for Hunter. He’s better at mitigating edge penetration.  \nHunter is an adequate receiver, but he has lapses with clap-attacks when extending his arms to targets away from his \nframe. His hands get wide, and he must focus on extending his hands remaining together so he doesn’t have to make a \nsecond adjustment that will always be too late and force him to fight the ball.  \nWhen Hunter times everything perfectly as a pass protector, he earns a square position and delivers an uppercut punch \nwhere he rolls through his hips to stand up the defender. This doesn’t happen enough. At this point, Hunter has a lapses \nwith a variety of details that render him more of a temporary obstacle on the way to the pocket.  \nIf Hunter cleans up 2-3 of these issues and the other 1-2 are reduced to occasional lapses, he could deliver as a cohort in a \ncommittee backfield. He could become a consistently productive player with big-play ability.  \nVision: He identifies penetration effectively after the exchange. He must identify interior penetration faster than he does \nand act faster when he sees it. He has run into the backs of blockers that he should have easily avoided because the \npenetration was apparent as he took the exchange.  \nWhen working downhill with gap schemes, Hunter attacks the crease decisively unless it’s a tight crease. In those cases, he \nlooks for a bounce or cutback and not in ideal situations. When backed up deep in his own territory, 2nd and 6s aren’t the \ntime to bounce the play against penetration or a run blitz and losing four yards when he could have gotten downhill and, at \nworst, minimized the loss to a yard.  \nAs a zone runner, Hunter doesn’t attempt bounces or cutbacks that exacerbate trouble when the primary crease isn’t ideal, \nand he’ll attack tight creases in short-yardage situations with double teams and lead blockers ahead.  \nHunter reads leverage on zone plays and can set up the first- and second-level defenders with a juke and a head fake. He’ll \nuse the fake as he presses within a step of his linemen.  \n\n \n121 \nHe’s a determined, hard-charging downhill runner in the open field whose creativity is on the efficient side, if he employs it \nat all.  \nElusiveness: Hunter adjusts his stride length when setting up pullers on gap plays. He uses jukes and head fakes to create \nfavorable leverage between the tackles.  \nHunter can drop his weight into a quick stop to avoid penetration up the middle and then open his hips to slide across the \npursuit into the adjacent crease. His hip flip of 90 degrees from the boundary to downhill is fluid and he can use it to \ntransition without a step when he’s running at a moderate pace. He flips his hips as well as anyone in this class—or several \nclasses.  \nHunter only needs two quick steps when transitioning downhill from a perimeter approach to the far sideline. There are \nperimeter runners where he can bend downhill without a transition step.  \nHunter has sudden feet when working behind the line of scrimmage and setting up blocks or opting for cutbacks/bounces. \nWhen he works through tight creases, he has the mobility to weave through defenders and small gaps. He also plays with \npacing to set up creases.  \nHe can hurdle defenders in the open field.  \nAcceleration: Hunter has the acceleration to beat linebackers, safeties, and cornerbacks around the far-side edge and take \nthe corner on designed perimeter runs. He also beats linemen, linebackers, and safeties with downhill runs from the middle \nof the field.  \nSpeed: Hunter can outrun safeties on runs up the middle of the defense—both near the box or well into the third level of \nthe defense. He can hold off a safety or corner for 30-35 yards.  \nPower: Hunter has a powerful stiff arm that can ward off reaches from linebackers. He keeps his feet moving through \nwraps to his pads and torso from linebackers and defensive linemen. He forces gang tackling when wrapped high.  \nHunter runs through reaches to his lower legs. He consistently drags box defenders forward when wrapped at his torso.  \nHunter can get his feet and knees high enough to work through contact to his lower leg, if not avoid it.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Hunter wins direct collisions with safeties and linebackers when he has downhill momentum. He \ncan stalemate defensive ends hitting him directly.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Hunter can remain upright through a glancing shot from a safety to his pads when both him \nand the defender have momentum into the collision. The same is true with nose tackles who wrap and hit with feet in the \nground. He gets dropped from linebackers who leave their feet when they hit and wrap but wins or stalemates substantial \nshots from linebackers with glancing shots to one side of his chest or pads in the hole when he’s heading downhill.  \nRoutes: Hunter has snap with his turn on a stop route, but against off-coverage, his stems are too deep into the defender.  \nAgainst off-coverage playing zone, Hunter works to depth and settles into the open area. He’ll also work into open space \nwhen his first break doesn’t earn a target and the QB begins scrambling. He tempos his breaks across zones so he \nmaximizes the time he’s in open space. He waits to show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \nWhen working out-breaking routes against tight coverage, Hunter has flat drive and line steps and he snaps his turns to \nwork back to the quarterback. He gets his head around fast.  \nHunter has a sudden two-quick at the top of stems against off-coverage that leads into a flat break outside or inside.  \nReceiving: Hunter tracks the ball over his shoulder on flat routes, but clap-attacks the ball above his helmet and this can \nlead to juggles and drops. When his hands are tighter, he makes clean catches without clap-attacks. In two games, he \njuggles and/or drops the ball on targets at helmet level and above more often than he catches them due to clap-attacks. \nHunter can highpoint the ball on RPOs and screens.  \nHunter can make catches at his waist or below with underhand position and turning back to the target arriving behind his \nbreak path. Hunt extends his arms from his frame with these targets and catches the ball with his hands. Hunter’s hands \ncan also get too wide with targets below his knees and this leads to drops.  \n\n \n122 \nWhen transitioning downhill with a defender within sight, Hunter hesitates and attempts stop-start movements when an \nattack immediately downhill would be optimal. He must learn to follow catch and pierce principles. \nIn 2024, Hunter did better with catch-and-pierce opportunities on RPOs with blockers ahead of him.   \nBlocking: Hunter gets good height with the standing version of a cut block, but he must shoot through the target. He must \nbe wiser about when to employ this method based on the opponent and his position in the pocket. He must earn more \ndepth in the pocket to attempt this maneuver.  \nWhen using a stand-up approach, Hunter overextends and leads with his helmet. This nullifies his reach with his hands and \nany potential for a strike where he can control the defender with a follow-up. The defenders win easily with redirects in \nthese scenarios.  \nHunter identifies edge pressure but must earn more depth in the pocket before squaring up the assignment. When the \nblitzers are slower-developing—DB blitzes—Hunter earns appropriate depth. He over sets and tips off edge pressure that’s \npatient with him. They run around him unblocked.  \nWhen he times his strike appropriately and minimizes his overextension on occasional assignments. Hunter keeps his hands \ntight, elbows bent, and rolls through his hips when he punches the linebacker’s chest. Or Hunter’s hands are tight, elbows \nbent, and he can move his feet after landing his hands without a hip-rolling through a strike.  \nHe can maintain position on an A-Gap blitz from a linebacker when his hands are tight and he begins with a squat and \nsquare stance.  \nHunter can miss his assignments as a lead blocker because he overextends and tips off his attack, but his effort is strong. \nHe’ll peel off his initial assignment on the perimeter after earning contact to attack the next defender at the boundary and \nmake two blocks to help his teammate get the edge.  \nBall Security: 1 fumble per 126.8 touches – 5 in 634 touches – during a 4-year career. He can carry the ball tighter to his \nside. His elbow has been tighter in 2024 but can still come loose. He uses the boundary-side arm.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Hunter has value in Rounds 3-4 in most leagues. He might fall beyond the fourth round. \nEither way, he’s worth stashing for 1-2 seasons because he has the ability to contribute right away and develop on a fast \ntrack as he earns more playing time.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHip mobility \n• \nAcceleration, speed, stiff-arm/power \n• \nTracks over the shoulder and combative \n• \nOverextending and setting too early \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nCareer Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n123 \n \n \n \nRB Jo’quavious “Woody” Marks RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: RB21 \nJersey: No.4  \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/207 School: USC/Mississippi St. \nComparison Spectrum: Cadillac Williams-Jerome Ford/X-Julius Jones-James Jackson \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 80.7 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. Marks \nis on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nWisconsin ‘24 \n• \nMichigan ‘24 \n• \nLSU ‘24 \n• \nNebraska ‘24 \n• \nPenn State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Marks is a good runner with a high floor as a contributor of value off the bench and a ceiling as a \nproductive lead back. He’s a passing-down weapon with functional play strength between the tackles and wise game \nmanagement as a decision-maker between the tackles.  \nMarks has at least contributor-level skill in every phase of his game except for his long speed and route running – and his \nlong speed is good enough to flip the field if he gets into the secondary untouched. Considering that Marks’ burst is star-\ncaliber, that happens more often than his speed may lead you to believe if solely looking at it on paper.  \nMarks is one of the better pass protectors in this class and should offer enough situationally to contribute early as a \nsituational passing-down option and change-of-pace who could see his touches increase during his rookie year. Considering \nthat Marks rarely fumbles the ball, he’s a good bet to make an active roster and develop into a productive contributor or \ncommittee option. It’s even logical to expect Marks take over for an injured starter and deliver starter production of his own \nat the height of his career.  \nVision: Marks reads the leverage of defenders on lead blockers when running Power. He’s patient enough to work with the \ndesign, but he also spots cutback opportunities—even with gap plays.  \nMarks anticipates tight creases that the play design open on power and he’s decisive with accessing those lanes, including \ntight cutback lanes up the middle.  \nMarks finds solutions to unanticipated obstacles. He’s a confident tight-crease runner with zone plays. He’ll attack downhill \nand leap through creases if need be. However, Marks is not a patient runner with inside zone. He hits creases too much like \nthey are gap plays and doesn’t give himself chance to press the line and let key blocks develop.  \nWhen backed up in his own red zone, Marks manages his carries so he doesn’t veer from the play design and put his team \nat risk for a loss that could hurt the team.  \nIn the open field, Marks is efficient with moves to make a defender miss, but he’s not making cutbacks at the second level. \nOnce he hits the crease, he’s going downhill and maybe making a dip or small move to set up a dip away from pursuit over \nthe top. Any other pursuit, he’s running through or getting tackled.  \nElusiveness: Marks can drop his weight to decelerate fast and cut away from pursuit that’s on top of him in traffic. He’ll \neven throw in a head fake. When transitioning downhill from a perimeter approach, Marks only needs two steps.  \nMarks uses a double up to alter stride length and pace and set up pulling blockers behind the line of scrimmage. He uses a \nhip shift in the open field to juke a linebacker in open space at full speed.  \nMarks can open his hips efficiently to bounce outside. He also executes sharp pressure cuts in succession to weave around \nunblocked defenders in the crease.  \n\n \n124 \nMarks combines the stiff-arm and spin to initiate contact in the crease and then work away from it. Marks has micro \nmovements to work away from pursuit reaching for him in tight traffic. He can dip the shoulder away as he enters a crease \nto avoid a defensive tackle reaching for him.  \nAcceleration: Marks has the quickness to accelerate past unblocked defensive linemen when reversing field with a cutback. \nHe can accelerate past linebackers and defensive backs in the second level of the defense.  \nSpeed: Marks extends runs 40-60 yards once he reaches the secondary. He can maintain separation against slot defensive \nbacks and safeties, forcing the fastest corner on the field to chase him down.  \nPower: Marks runs in traffic with low pad level. He pulls through reaches to his upper body from defensive linemen near \nthe line of scrimmage.  \nMarks has good range and placement with his stiff arm in a crease against an oncoming linebacker. He can keep his feet \nwhen wrapped high by a defensive lineman, but he doesn’t generate a push without help.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Marks can stalemate a direct hit from a defensive tackle or defensive end when Marks has \ndownhill momentum into the collision at the line of scrimmage.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Marks works through creases with low pads and he bounces off linebacker’s glancing shots to \nhis legs or frame, forcing the defender to wrap and drag Marks to the ground. Marks also bounces off hard glancing shots to \nhis knees and legs from safeties. He has an effective balance-touch.  \nRoutes: Marks can get confused with when to tempo his breaks across the field and when to settle in the open zone. He’ll \nchase a defender’s back hip on routes breaking back to the quarterback.  \nReceiving: Marks has quick reactions with his hands as a receiver. He can earn unexpected targets thrown with zip in a \nshort range and into his body. He can make underhanded catches with one hand tight to his hip or reaching away from his \nframe and below his knees.  \nMarks catches targets with overhand position away from his frame and secures the ball quickly to his frame. He can take a \nhit to his side as he secures the ball. He can take hard shots to his chest or back.  \nMarks tracks the ball over his shoulders and extends his arms with underhand attack on wide routes. Marks can get both \nfeet in bounds with a wide-open target tight to the boundary or with a target forcing him to lean over the sideline and \nextend his frame.  \nBlocking: Marks identifies edge pressure, slides to a position tight with his tackle, and cuts off the pressure as part of a \ndouble-team. Marks earns a square and squat position. He shuffles his feet well to maintain a wide stance and get across \ngaps to the best spot for the assignment.  \nHe’s a willing chipper of edge pressure before leaking to the flats or middle as a receiver. His chips have enough intensity to \nslow the opponent but they aren’t so violent that they knock the defender away from his teammate’s enviable position.  \nMarks takes the air out of the interaction with the opponent. He delivers his hands with elbows bent and tight enough to \nreach the chest play of the opponent. Although he leans forward into the contact, he keeps his pads and head up so he’s \nusing that momentum to strike with his hands. This can temporarily freeze an edge defender.  \nMarks spots A-Gap pressure, earns depth into the pocket, and earns a tight position with his hands into the defender’s chest \nplate when he strikes. Because he leans into the contact, he can lose position after the strike and allow the defender an \neasier redirect path if the strike doesn’t cost the defender his balance.  \nAs a stalk blocker. Marks works into the defender’s body and keeps his feet moving to generate a push. He can forget to \nanchor and this makes it easy for a defender to counter inside/outside and shed Marks because the back is off-balance.  \nMarks has good timing with cut blocks against edge defenders. He’ll work across and through the defender’s frame. His \nshots can be a little higher and he must keep his head up so he can see where he’s aiming.  \nMarks identifies twists and he’s patient and accurate about earning position against the defender twisting to the edge of the \npocket. He doesn’t shy away from delivering his hands against a defensive end. He also doesn’t overextend, keeping his \neyes and head up.  \n\n \n125 \nBall Security: Marks carries the ball high to his chest and his elbow tight to his side. He can take contact to the ball and \nball-carrying arm.  \nMarks uses the boundary-side arm. He has 1 fumble per 176 touches—5 in 880 touches over a 5-year career. For the past \nthree seasons, Marks averages a fumble every 275 touches – 2 in 550 touches since 2022.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Consider Marks in the fourth round of most rookie drafts without an IDP component. If \nMarks falls past the fourth round and you weren’t considering him, he’s a potential bargain after that.  \n \nHe’s an underrated player in this class. It may not lead to him becoming the next long-term late-round starter, but he’s \ncapable of becoming an effective starter when called upon. If he doesn’t earn it long-term, he could be one of those players \nwho has 2-3 starter-like seasons in relief of a teammate.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPressure cuts in succession \n• \nHand-eye coordination and oddball grabs \n• \nHip shift, peripheral vision, spin, micro movements, top quickness \n• \nHips, deceleration, cuts, moves in succession \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nHighlights vs Penn State (2024) \n• \nHighlights vs. Michigan (2024) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n126",

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB22 \nJersey No. 20 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/226 School: Michigan  \nComparison Spectrum: Brian Robinson - - X/Kendall Milton - Carson Steele \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 80.3 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \nMullings is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nFresno State ‘24 \n• \nUSC ‘24 \n• \nWashington ‘24 \n• \nOhio State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Mullings is an aspiring Brian Robinson in style of play and role. Talent-wise, his speed, acceleration, \nand agility may never reach those heights. Still, he’s an effective runner with good patience and understanding of Duo and \nGap schemes. His patience and cutback skills should help him transition to inside zone and windback plays as well.  \nLike Robinson, Mullings has enough agility to decelerate quickly, which is one of the most important aspects of carrying the \nball and running routes. He also has the mobility in his hips to make efficient 90-degree turns so he can bounce away from \ndefenders closing on him in traffic. Robinson also has good control over his footwork and transitions downhill within a \nstarter-worthy two steps.  \nMullings forces defenders to give chase in the open field and he can flip the field when the box is favorable for him to reach \nthe secondary untouched. Mullings needs a well-blocked perimeter play to turn the corner on linebackers and safeties. His \nacceleration is acceptable for running between the tackles. He needs more support on the perimeter.  \nMullings wins collisions with defensive backs and many linebackers. He can stalemate against linemen in some situations. \nHe’s an effective finisher and tackle-breaker who can close out games with his size and power.  \nMullings passing-down work has the baseline skills for him to develop into a good player in these phases of the game, but \nhe has lapses to curtail that can limit his effectiveness. Robinson was better than Mullings in these phases of the game early \nin his career.  \nLook for Mullings to make an active roster. He has the potential to earn a situational role off the bench that could develop \ninto a complementary role to a lead back with explosive capabilities.  \nVision: Mullings is an effective Duo runner who presses within a step of the line and unblocked defenders to set up \ncutbacks. He can press inside and bounce outside, setting up force defenders coming from the second level.  \nMullings can press within a step of the blockers and bounce or cutback. He identifies penetration and executes efficient \nsolutions.  \nMullings finds cutbacks on Power. Although he accesses cutbacks and takes risks with reverse field in exceptional scenarios, \nhe is a sound decision-maker who manages his risk according to down-and-distance and field position. He takes what the \ndefense and scheme gives him when the scenario favors making conservative decisions and limiting risk.  \nElusiveness: Mullings drops his weight effectively as he presses within a step of his blockers before riding the wave on a \nbounce or cutback. He changes his pacing and stride length to set up creases.  \nMullings can open his hips with the point of the toe to set up a bounce away from penetration up the middle. He uses the \njump stop to press within 1-2 steps of a blocker/defender and cutback to the open crease. He’ll also deliver small jump cuts \nto avoid a defender shedding a blocker in the intended gap and slide to the adjacent gap that’s open.  \nWhen working to the short-side edge, Mullings can transition downhill with two steps.  \n\n \n127 \nAcceleration: Mullings can work past defensive linemen on Toss to the short sideline but gets run down before he can turn \nthe corner on a linebacker or safety. Mullings can pull away from safeties in the second level and force them to chase for \n20-30 yards before catching up.  \nSpeed: Mullings has enough speed to flip the field or hold off secondary defenders in pursuit when he breaks through a \nloaded box and there’s no defenders in the secondary when he reaches it.  \nPower: Mullings is a strong runner who can push a linebacker several yards backward. He can also turn the position of a \ndefensive tackle and work through the contact.  \nMullings can throw a stiff arm with abandon as a defender reaches for him. He can also deliver a quick swat past a reach in \ntraffic.  \nMullings works through multiple points of contact during a run.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate a defensive tackle in the hole when he has the momentum into the tackle \nsliding inside and downhill into the hit.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Mullings can take a glancing shot to his chest from a linebacker shooting the crease. He has a \nstrong forearm shiver into contact. He has the contact balance to take a shot from a defensive tackle with momentum at the \nline of scrimmage and bounce off the hit and slide into the adjacent gap. He either forces the DT to chase and wrap or \nanother defender to make the tackle.  \nRoutes: Mullings has a sudden two-quick or double up release against off-man coverage. He executes a flat turn and gets \nhis head around early.  \nWhen facing zone, Mullings works to depth against the second-level defender and breaks into the open area, tempoing the \nbreak and showing his eyes once he passes the buzz/rollover defender.  \nReceiving: Mullings will attack targets with his arms away from his frame and use overhand position at the beltline, but \nhe’s prone to clap-attacking and this leads to drops. He extends away from his frame for low targets below the beltline as \nwell and attacks the ball effectively with underhand position.  \nMullings can take a hit to his chest and side as he secures the ball. He’s adept at attacking the ball at the earliest available \nwindow.  \nHe displays boundary awareness and will drag the feet to catch a target away from his frame with full extension of his \nframe.  \nBlocking: Mullings shoots through his targets as a cut blocker. He has good height when shooting through the hip of the \nopponent—including defensive tackles. He shoots with his head up and with good timing.  \nMullings has lapses where he doesn’t get as much height and work as far across edge pressure. This can lead to cuts that \nstill take a defender off-balance but give the defender room to continue forward in the pocket—albeit off-balance.  \nMullings squares his frame with a wide stance. He closes the gap with blitzing defenders and gets his hands and pads into \nthe chest of the defender. Mullings has the balance to handle a linebacker coming downhill hard and anchoring the contact.  \nMullings identifies slot blitzes. He works across the line to the opposite edge, squares the defender, and closes the gap with \nthe opponent. He moves his feet well and can anchor once he gets in position to get his feet under his pads.  \nMullings can have lapses that leads to him overrunning a position that gives a defender opportunity to redirect. He also has \nlapses where he overextends into contact and gives a defender opportunity to shed the defender easily.  \nHe gives a substantial chip to edge defenders that slows their progress without forcing them off the primary blocker. Mullins \ncan be too slow to earn position at the edge against a defensive end or edge rushing specialist with NFL-caliber skills. \nMullins can also set up just fast enough to make contact, but not in a balanced position and the defender can strike Mullins \nat the best angle to knock the RB down on his way to the pocket.  \n\n \n128 \nBall Security: Mullings has 2 fumbles in 250 touches – 1 per 125 touches. However, most of Mullings’ work came in 2023 \nand 2024 and he didn’t fumble during those 233 touches. He carries the ball high and tight and under the boundary-side \narm. However, the ball can get loose from his side as he changes direction.  \nDurability: Mullings had a minor injury at the end of his career where he missed two bowl games.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Mullings from afar unless in a league with 40-50 roster spots and a healthy \npractice squad. At least avoid Mullings until the NFL gives him draft capital that leads us to reconsider.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPress/cut, acceleration, spin, power \n• \nPress/cut, acceleration, deep speed \n• \nOverextension w/pass pro \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n129",
        "analysis": "Kalel Mullings is a power back prospect with a strong NFL comparison to Brian Robinson.  \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power Running:** Mullings excels at running between the tackles, winning collisions with linebackers and even some defensive linemen.

His success hinges on improving his pass-catching consistency and perimeter running abilities. He needs consistent effort in pass protection to become a more valuable asset.  His chances of making an NFL roster are deemed good, but he'll likely start on the bench.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB23 \nJersey No. 1 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/204 School: Syracuse \nComparison Spectrum: Bilal Powell - Kenneth Gainwell/X - - Jordan Mims \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 80.2 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. Allen is \non the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nUNLV ‘24 \n• \nNC State ‘24 \n• \nVirginia Tech ‘24 \n• \nMiami ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Allen lacks a top gear and his acceleration isn’t special, but he’s athletic enough to contribute to an \nNFL offense. What he does best is catch the football and work in open space.  \nAllen runs good routes for a running back and has potential to become a mismatch against man-to-man coverage. As a \npass-catcher, Allen wins the targets placed at a range of spots around his frame and he sound technique to do so. His \nbiggest lapses come when high-pointing and his wide hands lead to clap-attacks.  \nAllen has good feet between the tackles and in the open field. He gets his feet over shots and layers moves in succession to \nset up defenders.  \nAllen also displays control of his feet at high speeds and has the agility to transition downhill with a single transition step. \nHe reads level and presses blocks effectively. He also displays pre-snap smarts, identifying box advantages, pre-snap to set \nup immediate solutions.  \nHis blocking is the area in greatest need of refinement. When Allen’s feet and legs are in a balanced position, he \noverextends. When he uses his hands well, his lower body isn’t balanced.  \nAllen may never become a full-time starter of note, but he can become a contributor in a committee who delivers in passing \ndowns and two-minute offenses.  \nConceptual: LeQuint Allen’s lawsuit settlement is worth noting. It appears Allen was acting in self-defense and the \noutcome suggests as much.   \nVision: Allen will press a block and read the leverage of the defender to determine when to cut back. He does with his zone \nand gap runs. He can ride the wave of blocks for a bounce but could press a step deeper to truly set up the edge defender. \nAllen identifies obvious box advantages pre-snap and sets up the early cut back with a quick press after the exchange.  \nElusiveness: Allen can open his hips into a bounce or cutback with the point of the toe to the boundary. He alters his stride \nlength to work through tight creases on a zone run. Allen alters pacing to adjust to gap runs and pursuit in the open field. \nHe uses a nice little double up in the backfield after the exchange to slightly alter his pacing and buy space for the puller to \nget across the line and into his designated gap.  \nAllen gets his feet over fallen bodies in traffic. He’ll use a spin in the crease to attempt to work past pursuit shooting the gap \nfrom over the top. He layers moves in succession in tight space on gap plays to make defenders miss in traffic and set up \nhis pullers.  \nAllen can get downhill with a single step transition as he approaches the tackle on an off-tackle run. He does the same \noutside the tackle box in the near-side flat. He’s effective at leaping over the pile in the red zone. Allen also hurdles \ndefenders shooting for his knees in the open field.  \n \nAcceleration: Allen gets run down quickly by a safety working from the opposite flat. Allen can beat all three levels of \ndefenders to the short corner and turn the corner on them before a LB chases him down.  \n\n \n130 \nSpeed: Allen reaches top speed fast enough to reach the secondary but he doesn’t have that added gear to pull away from \ngood angles against third-level (and some second-level) defenders.  \nPower: Allen can pull through a reach in the backfield from a linebacker. He keeps his feet moving in tight traffic with \ndefenders wrapped around him and others pushing the pile. He bounces off hits from defensive backs and he’s a determined \nrunner near the goal line after contact from linebackers and/or safeties.  \nAllen wards off linebackers in space with his stiff arm. He at least forces defenders to slide down his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Allen can run over a cornerback in a direct collision. He can drop his pads into one side of a \nlinebacker direct downhill and spin off the contact to extend for additional yardage. He can also win with a shit closer to the \ncenter  of the linebacker, knocking the defender backward.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Allen can bounce off a linebacker’s hit to his legs in the crease or a defensive back’s hit to his \nlower legs while working toward the boundary. When working through a crease, he can bounce off a glancing shot to his \npads and chest from a defensive tackle and continue downhill if not wrapped. When wrapped, he can still continue forward \nwith his momentum from the runway into the hit.  \nHe has a capable balance-touch when knocked off his stride.  \nRoutes: Allen will widen stems against off coverage playing outside leverage. Allen identifies the second-level defender, \nworks to depth, and settles into the open field with a friendly position. He’ll tempo across a zone with a friendly position to \nprolong his state of openness in the zone.  \nAllen uses a two-quick release against shallow off-man and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe at the top of the \nstem. He snaps the turn and turn of his head with shallow speed breaks. Turns can be flatter.  \nAllen has a shed to counter the hands of off-coverage. He pairs a hesitation with a two-quick release. When split wide, Allen \ncan run a slant with a hard stick off the line and a shed counter against outside leverage.  \nThere’s some weight drop with his hard breaks, he has the physical skills to drop the weight deeper and deliver sudden \nbreaks.  \nReceiving: Allen can catch targets at his back shoulder while breaking across the field against tight coverage at his back. \nAllen will execute a pullback before the defender wraps Allen from behind. Allen can drag his feet if near the boundary while \nwrapped. He can also toe-tap inbounds in stride. \nAllen can also catch a target over his shoulder with one hand. He also can win a target when led into a hard hit to his thighs \nthat flips him awkwardly to the ground.  \nAllen can catch the football at the earliest window of arrival with overhand position. He tracks the ball over his shoulder with \nunderhand position away from his frame and behind his break. His hands can be a little wide with a slight clap with the \nunderhand attack. With targets above his head on routes breaking outside, Allen can leave his feet unnecessarily.  \nAllen will embrace the fall when catching a targets as he’s off-balance. Allen can catch and pierce downhill.  \nBlocking: Allen identifies a safety blitz and squares the target with a squat stance. He’s prone to overextending with is \nattack and leading his pads and his head down – especially against larger defenders. This leads to one-and-done contact \nwith little impact on the defender. When Allen delivers at his best, there’s a slight overextension but the hands are tight and \nthe head is up just enough that he can uppercut into the chest and his feet are balanced and knees bent.  \nAllen can square interior pressure and deliver his hands with tight position and aims for the chest. He doesn’t strike with \nforce, and his legs aren’t in a position to maximize a strike. He gets his toes and straightens his knees as he delivers his \nhands. When Allen’s feet and legs are in a balanced position, he overextends; when he uses his hands well, his lower body \nisn’t balanced.  \nHe identifies cross-blitzes and his assignment within the protection plan.  \nAt this point, Allen rarely integrates his upper and lower halves into a single standup block.  \n\n \n131 \nAllen’s cut blocks have promise. He times the shot effectively, works across the frame of the defender, and shoots through \nthe defender’s frame with good height. He also sees where he’s shooting. He could improve cut blocks against edge \npressure by earning an early position inside to force the defender further outside and then cut across the defender with his \nshot working toward the pocket rather than downhill.  \nBall Security: Allen has 5 fumbles in 644 touches – 1 per 128.8 touches—but in 2024, Allen only had 1 fumble in 292 \ntouches. Allen carries the ball high to his frame and can take a hit to the ball or ball-carrying arm.  \nDurability: Allen played through what appeared to be a bruised quad suffered early in the third quarter of the UNLV game.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you’re seeking starter upside, pass on Allen. He’s what we saw from Kenneth Gainwell \nin Philadelphia—a skilled but limited fantasy tease. He’ll likely be over-drafted as a sleeper. If you are in a deep league that \nstarts 4-5 backs and you’re taking a speculative shot on high PPR upside, Allen is a late-round pick if he falls to you.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nCatch vs hard shot and played through injury \n• \nContact balance, grit in the clutch \n• \nTight-traffic movement, creativity, and balance-touch in red zone \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n132 \nRB Montrell Johnson, Jr. Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: RB24 \nJersey: No.2 \nHeight/Weight: 5-11/212 School: Florida  \nComparison Spectrum: Terrell Davis-Johnathan Franklin-X/Joshua Kelley \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 80.1 = Rotational Starter: Rotational Starter Tier: Executes at a starter level in a role playing \nto their strengths. Johnson is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTexas A&M ‘22 \n• \nLSU ‘22 \n• \nLSU ‘23 \n• \nFSU ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Johnson is a well-balanced runner who is difficult to bring down with wraps high or with reaches low, \nhe’s a sound technician between the tackles who can run gap or zone. He’s an efficient mover with good spatial awareness \nof pursuit angles.  \nIf Johnson has developed enough acceleration and speed on the field that his athletic testing showed, he’d could become a \ncompelling prospect. If he can’t unlock this high-end explosion on the field, Johnson will be a low-end contributor who could \nmake a roster because he’s reliable and makes few mistakes. \nConceptual: Wise enough on an option pass to throw the ball away when he didn’t see a wide-open receiver in the red \nzone.  \nVision: Johnson spots interior penetration and can work away from it. He reads leverage and knows when to attempt a \ncutback or bounce. When working inside zone or behind double teams, he understands when to squeeze through tight \ncreases and run tough.  \nJohnson can press within a step of the defender or the line and bounce the play away from the pursuit. He also reads \nleverage well as a gap runner. In the open field, he can make multiple defenders miss with efficient movement and timing, \nthanks to his anticipation of pursuit angles.  \nJohnson has a good feel for cutbacks on stretch plays. He misses opportunities at the second level of the defender to access \na clean lane at the third level, bouncing the play toward unblocked defenders. If he anticipates the blocks in front of him, he \ncould earn a lot more. He misses pre-snap opportunities to read the box and determine one side is better to set up over the \nother based on the personnel count of the defenders in the box.  \nElusiveness: Johnson is quick enough and agile enough to duck and spin from quick-penetrating defensive linemen in the \nbackfield, rendering what could have been a wrap-up into a reach and then pulling through it. Johnson has a good feel for \nkicking his heels to his butt after getting his knees high to avoid shots to his feet from defenders in the open field. He \ncombines this well with his balance-touch (see power) to earn additional yardage.  \nOne of the best things that Johnson does is get his feet and knees high through contact. This is a big reason why he breaks \nmultiple tackles frequently during runs.  \nJohnson only needs two quick steps at the edge of the formation to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill \ntrack. He can also use curvilinear movement to bend downhill outside the tackle box and make that transition with one step. \nHe can work inside of a safety with this type of move and make the defender miss. Johnson alters his stride length to set up \nblocks, creases, and defenders in the open field. \nIn the open field, Johnson can layer moves in succession but must take care to keep his feet inside his shoulders so he’s not \nin a position that leads to slips. He has sharp lateral cuts that can get him across the face of defenders pursuing from over \nthe top. Johnson improved this area of his game in 2024—cutting down on the frequency where he did this and showing \nmore effective foot position.  \nHe uses jump stops and jump cuts effectively and can jump stop into a hip-opener, pointing the toe to the boundary to \nopen his hips and make a quick 90-degree turn.  \n\n \n133 \nAcceleration: Johnson tested better than what his acceleration often looks like on the field. On film, Johnson has had years \nwhere his acceleration didn’t appear notable. In limited time last year, his acceleration was good enough to beat linebackers \nand some defensive backs. Although the acceleration doesn’t appear as substantial as his workouts, he seems to be \nunlocking it more often on the field.  \nSpeed: Johnson tested better than what his speed looks like on the field. When he can reach his top gear unimpeded he \ncan outrun the angle of a safety over the top of him in the open field if he can force the safety into misjudging the angle \ninitially. Johnson’s mile-per-hour readings matched his difficulty beating defenders in the secondary in situations that would \nmatch his workouts at the NFL Combine, but it’s still starter-worthy.   \nPower: Johnson finishes with effective pad level. He’ll initiate contact with his pads or his free arm. He also keeps his feet \nmoving through contact.  \nJohnson pulls through reaches and can pull through multiple reaches during a carry. He has an effective stiff-arm that will at \nleast ward off a reach from a defender and force that opponent to slide down Johnson’s frame to wrap up. Johnson often \nlands the stiff-arm with enough leverage and power to put a linebacker on the ground. He can also put a defensive tackle to \nthe ground who is off-balance in pursuit.  \nJohnson also has an effective balance-touch to earn additional yardage when knocked off balance. He’s a combative runner, \nespecially in the secondary.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Johnson can stalemate head-on contact from a linebacker and try to spin off it. He can run \nthrough a safety’s hit in the open field.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off high and low indirect hits from linebackers and defensive backs. He can \nbounce off hard hits from defensive ends and carry them forward.  \nRoutes: Johnson identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nReceiving: Johnson uses overhand position at helmet level to catch targets. He uses underhand at the belt line. He can \nextend his arms away from his body to catch targets at the beltline.  \nBlocking: Johnson identifies edge pressure and squares the target with a wide stance and good bend at the knees and hips. \nHe will slide with the defender’s trajectory and deliver his hands with bent elbows in an uppercut motion. The hairline of his \nhelmet is at the chest without overextending.  \nJohnson can be patient and timely with his part of a double team either in the run game at the edge or with edge defenders \nearning pressure around the tackle.  \nJohnson identifies interior pressure working the B and C gaps on the other side of the quarterback. He’ll work across the \npocket to earn position against the defender. There are edge assignments where he could deliver a shot but only gives a \nsmall bump—even lighter than what you’d want from a chip.  \nBall Security: Johnson can maintain possession through reaches and pulls at the ball from linebackers and safeties. His \ncarriage and be higher and tighter. He swings the ball as he runs and only tightens the carriage when he’s aware of \nimpending contact.  \nUnless the play is designed specifically to the left side, he carries the ball under his right arm almost by default. Still, \nJohnson has only fumbled 3 times in 632 career touches—1 per 210.67.  \nDurability: Johnson played only five games in 2024 due to a knee injury. No surgery needed.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Johnson’s acceleration and speed makes him a high-floor prospect with a ceiling that \nappears sizable, but maybe not as grand as it appears on an Excel sheet until he unlocks his ability to maximize his \nacceleration and speed a little more on film. He’s a decent late-round bet in leagues with at least 5-7 rounds. In shallower \nformats, Johnson is a worthwhile free agent addition for an expanded offseason roster.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMontrell Johnson Highlights \n \n \n\n \n134",
        "analysis": "**LeQuint Allen (RB23):**\n\n* **Strengths:** Excellent receiver out of the backfield, running good routes and possessing soft hands.  Shows good agility and footwork in tight spaces and the open field, effectively layering moves to evade defenders.  Displays pre-snap awareness and reads defenses well.  Possesses decent power and contact balance, able to run through tackles near the goal line.  Improved ball security in 2024.\n* **Opportunities:** Could become a valuable contributor in passing downs and two-minute situations due to his receiving skills.  His athleticism allows him to contribute to an NFL offense.\n* **Weaknesses:** Lacks elite acceleration and top-end speed, limiting his breakaway potential.  Blocking needs significant improvement.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Bilal Powell (receiving ability, agility), Kenneth Gainwell (skillset, but limited upside), Jordan Mims (similar overall profile).\n\n\n**Montrell Johnson Jr. (RB24):**\n\n* **Strengths:** Well-rounded runner effective in both zone and gap schemes.  Excellent contact balance and power, breaking tackles consistently.  Displays good vision and reads defenses effectively.  Strong stiff arm.  Good spatial awareness and anticipation of pursuit angles. Improved elusiveness in 2024.\n* **Opportunities:** High floor prospect with potential for a sizable ceiling if he consistently showcases his athletic testing ability on the field (acceleration and speed). Reliable and makes few mistakes.\n* **Weaknesses:**  While testing well athletically, his on-field acceleration and speed haven't always translated consistently.  Ball carrying technique could be improved (higher and tighter).  Occasional missed opportunities to maximize vision and anticipate blocks.  Missed games in 2024 due to injury.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Terrell Davis (power, vision, contact balance), Jonathan Franklin (elusiveness, balance), Joshua Kelley (similar style).\n\n\n**Overall Summary:**  Both Allen and Johnson project as rotational players rather than starters. Allen's strength lies in his receiving ability, making him a valuable asset in passing situations, while Johnson excels as a power back with good vision and contact balance.  Both players need to refine certain aspects of their game to reach their full potential in the NFL.  Their fantasy value is likely limited to deeper leagues, particularly for Allen due to his lack of high-end speed and Johnson due to his inconsistent on-field speed/acceleration.\n"

        "player_name": "Marcus Yarns",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB25 \nJersey No. 21 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10” / 193 School: Delaware \nComparison Spectrum: Jamaal Charles - James Cook – X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 79.8 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nYarns is on the cups of the Rotational Starter Tier: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPenn State ‘23 \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Buyer Beware—I didn’t get to conduct the level of charting I normally do with prospects because I \ndidn’t have access to Yarns’ full complement of film. It means the frequency of the behaviors I saw from Yarns could be \nskewed in a direction that’s not the reality of his game.  \nIf what I saw from Yarns was an accurate representation of his game, this is a sudden athlete with good speed whose \npotential as a receiver could lead to a transition to the slot if running back doesn’t work out for him. Yet, when I watched \nYarns, he had a playing weight listed 10-15 pounds lighter than his weight at the NFL Combine.  \nThe fact that Yarns gained this muscle and ran well is a promising indication that he can become an NFL running back. \nYarns is decisive but sets up creases with patience—zone and gap blocking alike.  \nYarns uses his frame to his advantage in the crease, making micro movements to get skinny in tight confines. He adjusts \npacing and stride length to set up blocks, unblocked defenders, and his forays in the open field.  \nYarns also adjust his stride through contact, kicking his heels toward his backside like the top pros do when avoiding shots \nfrom backside pursuit. Watch Alvin Kamara tape, he’s among the best at it.  \nIn the open field, Yarns can decelerate on a dime, coming to a stop after running at full speed within two steps. This is also \none of the compelling reasons why he has skill as a return specialist and potential as a slot receiver.  \nAs a receiver, Yarns has developed moves to work free from man-to-man coverage and he creates a good target in open \nzones. His attack of the ball is consistent with the trajectory of the target. He’s a skilled tracker of the ball and displays late \nhands in the vertical game.  \nYarns has the basic positioning of an effective blocker, but he has work ahead if he’s going to become more than a runner \nand receiver in an offense. Still, Yarns is a skilled punt returner and has experience and success with punt coverage.  \nYarns will be a Day Three selection or priority free agent who should make a team. If he’s selected early in Day Three, his \ncoaches might have a role slated for him that translates to early opportunities in an offense.  \nIf not, Yarns will get his chance to work his way into a rotation thanks to his big-play versatility in two of the three phases \nof football.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Yarns has experience on punt coverage and has blocked a punt. He runs with the downfield \naggression of a punt returner. I could see a team giving him an opportunity to learn receiver as he does work on special \nteams.  \nVision: Yarns presses the outside shoulder of the outside lineman on a double team and cuts back tight to the inside \nshoulder to avoid pursuit from the inside and get through the crease. He does the same with the inside shoulder of a runner \nto bounce to the adjacent gap to the outside.  \nYarns is a decisive runner. With zone runs, he can be slow to approach and fast through the hole. He doesn’t attempt \ncutbacks and bounces in short-yardage and red-zone scenarios. He attacks the intended creases and works toward the soft \nspots incrementally if the primary creases are filled.  \nYarns identifies interior penetration at the exchange point and dips away from it on Duo.  \n\n \n135 \nYarns presses creases within a step of his double team to set up bounces and cutbacks. He sets up pullers with a press to \nthe outside shoulder before cutting inside and downhill.  \nElusiveness: Yarns can turn his pads sideways to get skinny through a tight crease. He has a capable spin to avoid pursuit \nfrom the outside.  \nYarns adjust his pacing and stride length behind pullers to set up an inside lane. He delivers sharp pressure cuts off hard \nsticks in the second and third levels of the defense.  \nYarns can get his feet high—kicking heels toward his backside—to avoid contact shooting low for his legs as he passes the \ndefender.  \nYarns only needs two small steps to transition downhill from a sideline approach to the far side or the near side and at a \ngood clip. He uses two-quick footwork in the open field to set up a safety coming downhill. It helps Yarns change direction \nwhile at full speed.  \nIn the open field, Yarns can decelerate on a dime, coming to a stop after running at full speed within two steps.  \nHe delivers a hard head fake to the outside and it moves a safety over the top.  \nAcceleration: Yarns can beat all three levels of defenders when he gets an early lane to accelerate fully.  \nSpeed: Yarns can pull away from most defensive backs he has accelerated.  \nPower: Yarns finishes runs with low pads. He keeps his feet moving through contact. He bounces off glancing shots from \nlinebackers and safeties.  \nYarns has generated a push against defensive linemen with D-1 size with his leg drive and attack. He can stay upright in a \npile for teammates to help.  \nYarns uses his stiff arm to swat away reaches from defender’s shooting for his legs as Yards exits a tight downhill crease.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Yarns can win a direct collision with a safety at the goal line with low pads. He can also hit and \nspin off the collision, rocking the safety with the hit after charging downhill into the man and quickly spinning off, ala Jamaal \nCharles.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Yarns drops his pads into a safety and can bounce off a glancing shot. He can bounce off a \nsafety or linebacker’s shot to his side and hip as he’s carrying the ball downhill.  \nRoutes: As a receiver split from the formation, Yards has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his \nfront foot. He uses a two-quick release to attack inside leverage and work to the outside. He also uses the two-quick to the \noutside to set up an inside release. He counters with a wipe.  \nYarns’ acceleration makes him a vertical mismatch for linebackers. He uses his eyes to sell the out on the out and up and \nthe wheel route.  \nYarns will dive toward the inside shade defender playing off-coverage. He earns separation in the vertical and deep games \nwith his speed and his stems.  \nYarns will identify the second and third level of a zone, work a vertical route, and tempo his break between zone defenders. \nHe shows his eyes to the quarterback once he passes the rollover/buzz defender.  \nReceiving: He uses overhand position for targets at his chest. For targets at his beltline, Yarns uses underhand attack.  \nYarns tracks targets over his shoulder with his back to the quarterback on vertical routes. He displays late hands. He can \nembrace the fall so he doesn’t land on the ball.  \nYarns can track the ball over his shoulder and wide for his frame with highpoint technique downfield of his frame.  \nBlocking: Yarns will work tight to his tackle as part of a backside double team. He shuffles his feet with a wide stance, and \nenough bend to remain flexible. He delivers his hands tight with bent elbows into the chest of a defensive end as part of the \ndouble team.  \n\n \n136 \nBall Security: Yarns carries the ball high to his chest. He uses the boundary-side arm. He can take a hit to the ball-carrying \narm. He has 2 fumbles in 429 touches – 1 per 214.5. Yarns swings the ball as he runs. His elbow is loose from his side and \nhe has had defenders strip the ball.  \nDurability: Missed part of NC A&T game in 2024 with lower leg injury.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Yarns is a late-round pick in deep leagues (35-40 roster spots) or a free agent addition for \nexpanded rosters spots in large formats. Until the NFL Draft, other formats should monitor from afar unless there are points \nfor return yardage. If so, Yarns is also a late-round pick.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPatience/press, acceleration, long speed \n• \n2023 Highlights (see Games Tracked) \n• \n2024 Highlights (see Games Tracked) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n137",
        "analysis": "Marcus Yarns is a versatile Day 3 prospect or priority free agent with RB25 ranking.

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB26 \nJersey: No.5 (New Mexico)/ Arizona \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/204 School: Alabama St./New Mexico/Arizona \nComparison Spectrum: Clinton Portis - Aaron Jones – X - Tevin Coleman \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.9 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTexas A&M ‘23 \n• \nWyoming ‘23 \n• \nBoise State ’23  \n• \nUtah State ‘23 \n• \nFresno State ‘23 \n• \nNew Mexico ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A quick-footed runner with between-the-tackles creativity, Croskey-Merritt has the athletic ability of a \nstarting NFL running back. His acceleration and speed are good enough for him to turn the corner on perimeter plays and \ngenerate field-flipping and breakaway runs.  \nCroskey-Merritt anticipates defender angles into the backfield, pre-snap and mitigates loses in the way one expects from a \nstarting NFL running back. While Croskey-Merritt displays patience as a decision-maker, he can improve the depth he \npresses into the line – he can take that one extra step he’s not, and this will help him bait all but the savviest of \nlinebackers.  \nIn addition to needing to take that one extra step, Croskey-Merritt could avoid making that one last cut. There are runs \nwhere he makes one move too many rather than taking what’s ahead of him and finishing strong. This is a by-product of his \nathletic ability and still learning the value of managing the game as a runner.  \nCroskey-Merritt’s movement skills are one of his greatest assets. He can open his hips, adjust his stride, make lateral cuts, \nand use curvilinear movement to work around obstacles without losing a lot of speed. He layers moves in succession as \nwell.  \nA good finisher, Croskey-Merritt keep his pads low and works through reaches and wraps – sometimes reaches and wraps \nduring the same carry. He’ll also bounce off hits from linebackers. Croskey-Merritt is a good tackle-breaker for his size and \nhas room to add another 10 pounds of muscle to his frame.  \nCroskey-Merritt has upside as a vertical receiver who wins high-points against overmatched linebackers. He also gets open \nin the underneath zones. His hands are reliable.  \nCroskey-Merrit’s pass protection has good points. He can handle a lot of linebackers and defensive backs. He must refine his \nposition against A-Gap pressure. He has some lapses as a cut blocker and some inconsistencies to clean up against edge \npressure.  \nThe things Croskey-Merritt must address aren’t insurmountable, which makes him a capable contributor or high-end reserve \nas a rookie who could grow into a productive contributor early in his career. There are a lot of backs in this draft with Depth \nof Talent Scores between 75-84. Croskey-Merritt is one of those whose game has more upside than trapdoors.  \nVision: Croskey-Merritt has quick feet and quick reactions to penetration. He adjusts his stride and pace effectively in tight \nspots so he can weave around unexpected pursuit angles in traffic.  \nCroskey-Merritt anticipates line slants, presses downhill, and slides away from the slanting lineman into a cutback lane. He \nreads interior and edge penetration during the exchange and makes adjustments to mitigate losses, if not generate small \ngains. He could press a little deeper when running Duo. He works within two steps of his linemen before making a cut but \ncould work that extra step to sell the middle linebacker better.  \nCroskey-Merritt reads blitzes pre-snap and finds solutions to limit losses, if not generate gains. He reads leverage well as an \noff-tackle/outside zone runner. He identifies when he should attempt the cutback rather than get strung out by multiple \ndefenders with a clear leverage advantage or come unblocked early.  \n\n \n138 \nStill, Croskey-Merritt can press deeper into the line as he works the cutback, riding the wave along the front so he can bait \nthe high safety out of position and potentially earn more yardage. He did this better at New Mexico than he did in his one \ngame in Arizona.  \nCroskey-Merritt presses the lead blocker’s outside shoulder to move the unblocked defender behind defensive front. This \nsets up a cutback. There’s evidence to suggest that he factors the box count of defenders to determine how he presses a \ngap play like counter.  \nHe has good feel for the boundary as a runner and will initiate contact against pursuit so he can give himself a chance to \nmeet the hit and remain in bounds as he works up the sideline.  \nCroskey-Merritt has lapses with zone runs where he attempts that one extra cut in the crease where, if he succeeds, he \nreaches the sideline with the rest of the field trailing him. However, he has a straight path for an easy 8-10 yards, if not \nmore.  \nHe makes riskier choices at the second and third level when the downhill path may be best. He overthinks runs and chooses \nto take on a defender outside of his path rather than maintaining the downhill route.  \nElusiveness: In addition to stride and pace adjustments with his quick feet, Croskey-Merritt can slide against the grain of \nline slants and find the cutback lane. His short area quickness is notable on tape. \nCroskey-Merritt has a tight spin that he executes even after running at a high rate of speed and collides with an opponent or \nteammate.  \nHe opens his hips with economy against penetration up the middle and this gets him outside. He also gets his feet and \nknees high when feeling low shots strike his feet in traffic.  \nCroskey-Merritt has curvilinear speed to the far-side edge to dip inside the force player. He also has a capable stick with a \nwide range of motion that sets up a pressure cut back to the inside.  \nWhen working to the edge of the box, Croskey-Merritt only needs two-quick steps to transition downhill from a boundary \npath.  \nCroskey-Merritt can layer small moves in succession such as cutting his stride length into a hip-opener  to set up a bounce \naway from a downhill pursuer.  \nAcceleration: Croskey-Merritt has the acceleration to beat box defenders up the middle and hold off a safety to the near \nsideline. He’s quick enough to accelerate past defensive ends, linebackers, and many safeties on outside zone to the far-\nside flat or boundary.  \nSpeed: He has the speed to hold off a safety to the near sideline.  \nPower: Croskey-Merritt can run through a linebacker’s wrap his upper or lower body at the edge of a crease and push \nforward for extra yardage. He keeps his pads low and continues moving his feet, twisting and turning through wraps if he \nmust. He’ll push a pile or at least keep his feet and generate a lean against linebackers and pursuing defensive linemen.  \nCroskey-Merritt’s stiff-arm can ward off a wrap from pursuing linebacker. He lowers his pads into safeties when finishing \nruns. Croskey-Merritt finishes a lot of runs where he pulls linebackers and defensive backs 3-5 yards downfield, if not more.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Croskey-Merritt can bounce off a linebacker’s direct shot, using good pad level into the collision \nso he can spin off the contact and extend forward.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Croskey-Merritt can stalemate a hard shot to his chest from inside pursuit of a middle \nlinebacker that stands him up and then stagger forward for another 3-4 yards. He can run through a glancing shot to his \nlegs from an outside linebacker when he’s working downhill.  \nHe can bounce off safeties with downhill momentum into glancing shots. He can stalemate a hard shot to his side from a \ndefensive end twisting inside on a run stunt.  \n\n \n139 \nRoutes: Croskey-Merritt identifies the second-level defender in zone coverage, works to depth and settles into the open \narea, or tempos his breaks through an open area while keeping his eyes to the quarterback to show his readiness for the \nball on a scramble drill.  \nCroskey-Merritt can beat a linebacker up the boundary on a wheel route at a range of more than 25 yards from the line of \nscrimmage.  \nReceiving: Croskey-Merritt extends for the ball with tight overhand position to attack targets above his chest. He catches \nand pierces downhill. He uses the appropriate attack for the trajectory of the target.  \nCroskey-Merritt can extend below his knees for the ball while on the run and embrace the fall so he doesn’t land on the ball.  \nCroskey-Merritt can high-point at an extreme range. He displays boundary awareness, even if the execution doesn’t work \nout. He delivers a good pullback from the trailing defender and can take contact to his side. He embraces the fall.  \nBlocking: Croskey-Merritt is quick to slide to the edge, square pressure with his knees bent in a squat position, and \ndelivers his hands to the chest of the opponent with his elbows tight. Croskey-Merrit takes the air out of his interactions \nwith defenders.  \nHis stand-up game is effective against some linebackers and most defensive backs. He is the first to take contact or his \nstrikes are with his forearms and it the lack of leverage gets him knocked backward at the collision point. He doesn’t \noverextend at the point of attack unless he’s chipping.  \nCroskey-Merritt works through potential assignments quickly and makes accurate decisions with whom to assist. When part \nof a double-team, he attacks the appropriate side of the defender. He’ll deliver a hard chip with his shoulder to rock the \ndefender but not so hard that he moves the defender off the blocker’s position.  \nCroskey-Merritt cut blocks with good height, works across the frame of the opponent, and shoots through the defender with \nhis eyes up. He can time his shots against interior pressure from linebackers a little better—he shoots a beat early and has \nto travel a longer distance to reach the defender. This gives the linebacker time to adjust and limits the potential of the \neffort.  \nHis timing was initially better as a cut blocker against edge defenders, but as the 2023 season progressed, Croskey-Merritt’s \ntiming was better with cutting interior pressure.   \nWhen Croskey-Merritt has lapses with cutting, he’s dropping his head too early against edge pressure and not getting \nenough height or width across the frame of the opponent.  \nWhen taking on edge defenders, Croskey-Merritt keeps his feet moving after establishing contact and drives the defender \noff his path to the pocket. When taking on edge defenders who are twisting inside, he’s square and delivers his hands, but \nhe lacks a punch and his interaction is a one-strike-and-done. Croskey-Merritt delivers two-handed strikes when chipping \ninterior defenders.  \nCroskey-Merritt is willing to put his pads into a twisting defensive tackle on the edge and he can stop that tackle when he \nlands the strike but he drops his head into the interaction and tips off the attack. Savvier defenders can make short work of \nthat effort.  \nCroskey-Merritt identifies A-Gap pressure and delayed safety blitzes at the edge of the formation. He picks up looping \nlinebackers when initially assigned to a slot or corner blitz off the edge. He can have difficulty earning position to square the \ndefender, but his strike can slow the man down. He has difficulty with cross-blitzes and allows his assignment into the \npocket.  \nBall Security: Croskey-Merritt carries the ball high to his chest and with his elbow tight. He can take contact to the ball and \nthe ball-carrying arm in traffic.  \nHe has lapses where the elbow gets loose from his side, especially when he’s working through contact in the open field, \nbouncing runs outside, or making a dynamic movement. He has lost a fumble due to a defender punching the ball loose \nfrom the gap between Croskey-Merritt’s elbow and side.  \nHe primarily carries the ball under his right arm—even when running designs to the left side of the field. He has 1 fumble \nper 100.8 touches—6 in 605 touches.  \n\n \n140 \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Croskey-Merritt is a good late-round pick in leagues with at least 5-6 rounds. His draft \ncapital or lack thereof may hurt his chances of becoming a contributor in the NFL, but his game has a solid floor without any \nsignificant trapdoors. He’s a high-upside option. Think a less refined Aaron Jones when Jones was at UTEP.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nFootwork, vision, acceleration \n• \nReceiving, contact balance, pads, security \n• \nPress and hip mobility \n• \nMobility and movement in succession \n• \nMakes three penetrators miss in red zone \n• \nDownhill mentality \n• \nCut Block vs Cross Blitz \n• \nHigh-point, embrace fall, pull back, and boundary awareness \n• \nCounter, box count, press decision, cutback, contact balance \n• \nSecond- and third-level cutbacks and feel for pursuit \n• \n2023-2024 Highlights \n• \nSophomore Highlights \n• \nHighlights vs Boise State (2023) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n141",
        "analysis": "## Jacory Croskey-Merritt: NFL Draft Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive Runner:** Possesses exceptional quick feet, agility, and short-area burst.  Effectively uses stride and pace adjustments to navigate tight spaces and avoid tackles.  Displays impressive lateral movement and the ability to chain together multiple moves.\n* **Vision and Decision-Making:** Shows good pre-snap reads of defensive alignments and anticipates penetration, adjusting his runs accordingly.  Understands leverage and identifies cutback lanes effectively.  While not perfect, his vision is a significant strength.\n* **Power and Finishing Ability:**  Despite not being exceptionally large, he's a surprisingly effective power runner, capable of breaking tackles and pushing through contact.  Keeps his pads low and finishes runs strongly, often dragging defenders for extra yards.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  A capable receiver out of the backfield, showing reliable hands and the ability to win high points against linebackers.  Comfortable catching in the underneath zones.\n* **Pass Protection (potential):** Shows flashes of solid pass protection, capable of handling linebackers and defensive backs.  Needs refinement in specific areas (A-gap pressure, cut blocking).\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refine Run Mechanics:** While possessing natural talent, he sometimes takes an extra cut or overthinks his runs, potentially missing easier gains.  Improving decision-making in the open field will significantly enhance his effectiveness.\n* **Increase Power:** Adding 10 pounds of muscle would further enhance his already present power running ability.\n* **Improve Pass Protection Consistency:** Needs more consistent technique in pass protection, particularly against A-gap pressure and in cut blocking situations.\n* **Ball Security:** While generally secure, occasional lapses in ball carrying technique (loose elbow) create vulnerability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum (Clinton Portis, Aaron Jones, Tevin Coleman) highlights his diverse skillset.  He's not a direct clone of any one player, but rather a blend of their attributes.  The comparison to a less refined Aaron Jones from his UTEP days is particularly apt, given his elusiveness and potential for growth.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nCroskey-Merritt is a talented running back with a high ceiling, though he needs refinement in several areas of his game.  His elusiveness, vision, and power running ability are attractive traits, and he's a potential late-round steal who could develop into a productive contributor in the NFL.  His floor appears to be a valuable reserve/special teams contributor, but his upside warrants a bet on his ability to develop into a starter.\n"

        "player_name": "Donovan Edwards",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB27 \nJersey: No.7 \nHeight/Weight: 5’11”/205 School: Michigan  \nComparison Spectrum: Darren McFadden - Tevin Coleman/X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.9 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPenn State ’22  \n• \nOhio State ’22  \n• \nIowa ‘22 \n• \nUSC ‘24 \n• \nWashington ‘24 \n• \nOregon ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Edwards burst onto the scene a couple of years ago. He’s a big-play weapon with breakaway speed \nand downfield receiving skills. Edwards also displayed toughness while making his mark—he played with a partially torn \npatellar tendon for most of his breakout year.  \nEdwards’ acceleration is one of the excellent traits of his game. He gets up to top speed early in a run. Once he’s there, he \nhas a next-level gear to pull away from a lot of defensive backs.  \nWhen he’s heading downhill toward pursuit, Edwards has a variety of moves to set up defenders without leaving his downhill \ntrack. When defenders shoot for his legs, Edwards gets his knees and feet high enough work past shots and through \ncontact.  \nWhen finishing plays, Edwards drops the pads, keeps his feet moving, and works through reaches, wraps, and hits. He \nearns enough momentum-generate power to drag defenders with him. Edwards’ stiff-arm wards off reaches and forces \ndefenders to slide to his lower legs.  \nAs good of an athlete, open-field runner, and pass-catcher as Edwards is, his game needs refinement for him to deliver that \nkind of production in the NFL. He’s not patient enough with run designs.  \nAlthough he has reps where he presses a step from the line of scrimmage, there are too many reps where Edwards doesn’t \npress deep enough and he fails to earn the separation he could have gained in the process. Specific to gap plays, Edwards \ndoesn’t remain with the backside puller long enough for the run design to unfold as planned.  \nIf Edwards and improve his decision-making and tight up his hands as a blocker, that might be enough for him to earn a \nsteady committee role for a team in a gap-heavy system.  \nTechnical: He’s a capable passer on option plays. He can deliver the ball 25-35 yards downfield.  \nVision: Edwards reads the front-side leverage on gap plays like Power and Counter and locates the cutback lane as he \nreaches the line of scrimmage. He’ll press the front side within 2-3 steps of the blocks or the unblocked defender before \nmaking his move to the open lane. He can press some runs within 1-2 steps of the line or penetration at the line before \nmaking his cut. \nEdwards’ presses need to be deeper on a consistent basis. He is more apt to press one step toward the line and execute his \ncutback or bounce, even when he sees the unblocked linebacker on the other side of the line of scrimmage. He’s usually \npressing within 2-3 steps of the line when running inside zone. A deeper press could get him the separation he’s lacking \nfrom this defender when he executes the cutback.  \nWith gap plays, he doesn’t stick with the backside puller long enough to give his double team a chance to work to its \nsecondary assignment. This forces Edwards to bounce plays too soon and the defense can string out the play for minimal \nyardage.  \n\n \n142 \nHe attacks interior creases on wind-back with confidence – even when the hole is tight. He will press within one step of his \nblockers on inside zone and find his cutback. Edwards spots the outside pursuit working inside once in the second level of \nthe defense and he’ll veer away.  \nElusiveness: Edwards will alter his stride length and pace on gap plays like Power to set up his puller into the hole. He \ngenerates explosion out of pressure cuts at the second level so he can work around pursuit from over the top.  \nAfter working downhill and then accelerating to the outside, Edwards can reach the boundary and transition downhill and \nbehind pursuit with two steps. He can transition downhill from a sideline approach at the edge of the tackle box with just \ntwo quick steps.   \nEdwards kicks his feet high enough from defensive backs into the open field to preemptively avoid lower-body wraps. He \ncan open his hips against penetration in the backfield with the point of the toe and work outside unblocked defenders.  \nWhen working against contact arriving from over the top, he’ll attempt to spin through the reach or wrap. He has an \neffective hip shift in the open field against cornerbacks with outside position on him. This allows him to freeze their pursuit \nlong enough to dip inside.  \nAcceleration: One of the most notable parts of Edwards’ game is his initial acceleration. He can work past linebackers \nshooting the gap into the backfield on runs to the short-side of the field.  \nSpeed: Edwards has the speed to extend his separation against pursuing defensive backs—corners and safeties. He has the \nspeed to cross the face of a safety playing over the top and beat the defender’s downhill angle on him. \nWhen he can open up his stride after a runway of 20-25 yards, Edwards can hit a maximum speed where he pulls away \nfrom most defenders who don’t have great angles of pursuit and top speed.  \nPower: Edwards has substantial momentum-generated power that can help him pull defenders 3-4 yards downhill. He can \nturn through a wrap of a defensive back and extend forward for 1-2 yards.  \nEdwards drops his pads low enough into collisions to bounce off and through contact. He keeps his feet moving through \nwraps which helps Edwards extend his frame downhill.  \nEdwards’ stiff-arm is effective enough to force an opponent to slide down Edwards’ frame for a wrap attempt at the lower \nbody. Edwards kicks his feet high enough through reach attempts to work free of them.  \nHe pulls through multiple reaches when in the open field. He also uses the stiff arm on defensive tackles on blockers and \nwards off their reaches.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can run through direct contact from a safety or corner when he has downhill momentum.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Edwards will knock a defensive back to the ground with his pad level at the point of attack in \nthe open field. He can meet a linebacker in the hole and bounce off the indirect contact to the pads. He’ll also meet a \ndefensive lineman in the hole and accelerate into the contact, generating a push downhill or bounce off the hit and spin and \nextend downhill.  \nRoutes: He has a flat speed turn and gets his head around fast. Good footwork to earn a little snap on the turn with short \nroutes.  \nHe works into open space on scramble drills, displaying good bodying language to communicate to the quarterback when \nhe’s open and that he’s settling into an area. He reads the underneath defenders to work behind them into open space.  \nWhen attacking an off-coverage defender’s position at the top of his stem, Edwards uses two-quick footwork. His speed \nbreaks lack a flat drive step and he drifts into the defender instead of executing a flat break.  \nReceiving: Edwards can track over his shoulder. He can also turn back shoulder and extend underhand for the ball at his \nwaist. He keeps his feet on the ground and extends wide of his frame.  \nEdwards attacks the ball at its earliest window when it arrives at the numbers and he’s using overhand attack or underhand \nattack. Edwards can extend below his knees for the ball without leaving his feet.  \n\n \n143 \nEdwards will high-point the ball and display awareness of the boundary—even as he’s backing his way toward the sideline or \nendling. He’ll drag at least one foot or sit down inside the field of play. \nHis jump up and through on back-shoulder plays fades into the defender and gives the defender an unnecessary opportunity \nto defend the target.  \nEdwards can make sliding catches of targets placed low and behind his break path. He’ll also embrace the fall to avoid \nlanding on the ball.  \nHe catches and pierces efficiently downhill. He obeys the location of the ball to make his turn.   \nBlocking: Edwards will work across the formation to the backside interior gaps to deliver his pads into the chest of a \nblitzing linebacker off play-action. He spots the corner blitz and earns good position to cut the opponent.  \nEdwards will deliver a chip to the edge defender when leaking from the backfield into a route. He throws his elbow and \nforearm into the opponent. He will use his shoulders to land a shot square into the chest of defensive tackles and ends. \nEdwards used his shoulder to deliver blocks in 2022 which may have to do with two screws in his broken hand and a cast \nthat he played all but two games with.  \nEdwards breaks down with good position to engage opponents, but he must deliver a punch with tighter hands. As of now \nEdwards claps his hands on either side of the defender’s shoulder or arm and it gives the defender the position to work \naround Edwards. When he doesn’t get engulfed early, Edwards will shuffle his feet with a wide base to remain square with \nhis opponents on the edge.  \nEdwards has a timely attack with cut blocks against interior pressure. He will work through the defender with good height \nand his eyes up. He must work across the defender with his frame rather than extending with just his forearm into the side \nof the leg. This was something he didn’t do well against Iowa earlier in the 2022 season, but fixed it against Ohio State at \nthe end of the year. His position against a corner blitz and a linebacker blitz was good enough to stone the defenders off the \nedge.  \nEdwards has lapses with cut blocks where he drops his head and eyes. He doesn’t see where he’s shooting and tips off his \nefforts. Defenders defeat these reps easily.  \nBall Security: Edwards carries the ball high to his frame. Although he fumbled against Penn State in 2022, he also showed \nin that game that he can take reaches, swats, and wraps to his ball-carrying arm and the ball.  \nHe carries the ball under his boundary-side arm. The ball drifts a little from his chest in the open field as he pumps both \narms while running. The elbow can be a little tighter to Edwards’ frame. \nEdwards has 5 fumbles in 512 touches during 4 seasons at Michigan – a fumble every 102.4 touches.  \nDurability: Edwards played through a broken hand in November 2022 that required two screws. Played with a partially torn \npatellar tendon in the second game of the 2022 season against Hawaii. He had surgery after the season in February. \nRecovery took four months and after three months, Edwards felt normal.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Edwards didn’t finish his career as a starter after a strong year in 2022. The talent is \nthere for him to become a productive player. If he finds a good fit in the way Tevin Coleman did in Atlanta, he could be a \nlate-round bargain in deep fantasy leagues. He could be a Day Three pick in the NFL Draft.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSpeed \n• \nPatience needed with pullers \n• \nCareer Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n144",
        "analysis": "Donovan Edwards is a talented running back prospect with high-end athleticism and breakaway speed, but his game needs refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elite Acceleration and Speed:**  Edwards possesses exceptional initial burst and top-end speed, allowing him to pull away from defenders in the open field.  He can easily outrun defensive backs.\n* **Open-Field Elusiveness:** He shows a variety of moves to avoid tackles, including impressive footwork, a stiff arm, and the ability to make sharp cuts. He's adept at creating separation from pursuing defenders.\n* **Power:** Despite his size, Edwards displays surprising power, able to drag defenders and run through contact. He consistently keeps his legs churning through tackles.\n* **Receiving Ability:** He's a capable pass catcher with good hands, body control, and the ability to track the ball over his shoulder.  He can make plays in space.\n* **Durability:** Edwards demonstrated remarkable toughness playing through significant injuries (partially torn patellar tendon, broken hand) during his college career.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Decision-Making:**  Edwards needs to improve his patience, especially in gap schemes. He often doesn't wait for blocks to develop fully, leading to missed opportunities.  A deeper press at the line of scrimmage would significantly improve his production.\n* **Blocking Technique:** While he shows effort in pass protection, his hand placement and technique need work.  Improving his hand usage would make him more valuable as a three-down back.\n* **Route Running:**  His route running needs refinement, especially his breaks which tend to be too rounded, lacking a sharp, flat drive step.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report uses Darren McFadden and Tevin Coleman as comparison points.  McFadden highlights his big-play ability and speed, while Coleman references his role as a productive player despite not always being a feature back.  This suggests Edwards could be a valuable contributor as a complementary back with explosive potential.  He's likely a Day Three draft pick.\n\n**Overall:** Edwards has the talent to make an NFL roster, but he requires coaching to address his decision-making and blocking technique.  If he improves these aspects of his game, he could become a valuable weapon as a change-of-pace back with significant home run potential.  However, failure to refine these aspects will likely limit his NFL career.\n"

        "player_name": "Ollie Gordon II",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB28 \nJersey: No. 0 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/226 School: Oklahoma State  \nComparison Spectrum: Deuce McAllister - David Johnson – William Green - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.5 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nTexas ‘23 \n• \nIowa State ‘23 \n• \nKansas State ‘23 \n• \nArkansas ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: If you’re a draftnik tuned into college football year-round, Gordon was one of the buzziest backs in \nthis class heading into 2024 after he led the FBS in rushing the year before. By the end of his final year, the buzz died after \na follow up effort that wasn’t as impressive in the box score or the highlight reel.   \nGordon still earned a roster spot at the Senior Bowl and rehabbed his media stock among those who judge football beauty \ncontests. However, his bubble burst for many of these types when Gordon didn’t have an outstanding performance at the \nNFL Combine.  \nWhat is Gordon? A future NFL starter who is better than his final season or a future backup who didn’t deliver up to \nexpectation in 2024 and at the NFL Combine?  \nGordon has talents and limitations that are readily apparent depending on the situation. Summing up his game requires \ncontext beyond, “he’s good/he’s bad.”  \nGordon is a skilled player in space. His size, strength, and movement are all assets when he can navigate open space, light \ntraffic, and big rushing lanes.  \nIn tight traffic, Gordon is prone to overacting and short-circuiting because he runs into definitive leverage advantages for \nthe defense. He doesn’t trust the play design as he should and bounces runs away from the strength of the design.  \nOnce he gets into open space, Gordon’s speed and acceleration are better than his performance at the NFL Combine. This is \na case where I would not overreact to his inability to be a track athlete because the speed measured on the field has been \nmore than good enough for Gordon to start in the NFL.  \nWhat concerns me most about Gordon isn’t his explosion but that he doesn’t accelerate into contact and play to his size and \nstrength. If he attacked more often at the point of the collision, he could dictate terms and become an excellent power \nrunner and set up movement away from collisions.  \nGordon’s contact balance is good, but it could be at a higher tier and transform his game. It’s rare to see players improve \nhis approach, so don’t count on this changing.   \nA good receiver out of the backfield, Gordon does his best work as an outlet for his passer. He creates opportunities for \ntargets and he has soft hands and good technique to extend for targets at a variety of angles.  \nGordon has areas where he thrives as a blocker and areas where he needs work. He’s better as a cut blocker to one side \nthan he is the other. He can overextend with specific assignments, dropping his head, and telegraphing his intent. He also \nlacks a punch.  \nIf Gordon cleans up the pass protection and refines his ability to finish with violence, Gordon’s potential range of outcome \nreally depends on one thing: The presence/absence of a gap blocking scheme. If Gordon joins a team with a gap scheme or \na simplistic approach to running outside zone, Gordon’s RSP Depth of Talent Score is two points higher and he’ll have the \npotential to contribute as a rotational starter regardless of his improvements as a blocker and finisher. If he improves those \nareas, he could be a productive NFL starter in this scheme.  \n\n \n145 \nIf Gordon lands on a team that requires him to run zone plays far more often than gap plays, subtract two points from his \nDepth of Talent Score. Gordon will be a contributor on the cusp of a reserve—and likely bouncing around the league as a \nreserve who gets a handful of carries per game, at best.  \nIf Gordon lands on a team that uses a mix of gap and zone, his score is what you see at the top of his report. He’ll need to \nimprove in multiple areas and earn a role that’s leverage his gap prowess.  \nArrested in July 2024 on suspicion of DUI, we’ll see if this was an issue of maturity or a chronic problem.   \nVision: When running Duo, Gordon identifies the numbers advantage in the box pre-snap. He’ll also press the interior \ndefenders before bouncing the play when the numbers advantage is to the outside. He presses lead blocks effectively to set \nup wide-open lanes behind it.  \nGordon will attempt to spin inside play-side pursuit of a linebacker running inside-out to meet him over the top in the flat. \nHe would be better off work through the contact. Instead, he attempts to spin after building up enough momentum that a \nspin eliminates any momentum-generate power and coming to a quick stop to undercut the chasing defenders is difficult for \nmost backs.  \nGordon also overreacts to developing leverage advantages on the edge of a run design where he’s heading downhill. \nInstead of committing to the play design inside, he tries to cut across the blocks he should be taking and bounce or cutback \nto the opposite end of the box. Now he’s running into a definite leverage advantage for the defense.  \nGordon identifies penetration early enough to adjust his path and minimize the pursuit angle or contact. He sets up pullers \nand finds cutback lanes off gap plays. He’ll squeeze into tight creases on cutbacks to avoid edge penetration. \nGordon reads leverage in the box and sticks runs inside to take what’s available. He’ll determine the one-on-one with the \nsafety in the hole is the best option and attack the safety at the entrance of a crease when many backs will work toward a \nbigger looking crease but with a leverage disadvantage favoring a bigger defender.  \nGordon must commit to the bounce when penetration forces him to accelerate earlier in the perimeter track than planned. \nOtherwise, his attempts to look for the cutback behind the edge pursuit becomes too difficult to execute and he loses \nyardage.  \nElusiveness: Gordon will use pacing and stride length variations to set up his acceleration through a crease as well as \navoid penetration into the backfield. He opens his hips with economy, which helps him change direction in the hole and slide \nto an adjacent crease while in traffic. He can tilt his hips during a run to slide away from reaches in tight quarters.  \nGordon can transition downhill form a perimeter approach with two quick steps when bouncing to the far hash from the near \nhash.  \nHe’ll make effective cuts downhill from edge penetration. Gordon has a spin, but it’s not explosive. His shoulder reductions \nfrom pursuit are effective in tight quarters. Gordon gets his feet and knees over shots. He can also hurdle defenders in the \nopen field.   \nAcceleration: Gordon has enough acceleration to beat inside linebackers to the short corner as well as working inside play-\nside defensive ends earning penetration from the edge. His acceleration is good enough to beat unblocked corners \ncontaining the flat on the play side and get up the boundary.  \nHe can also beat a safety in the box up the middle when that safety creeps into the box too far, too fast. Gordon beats \nBig12 safeties working to the far sideline, accelerating past them when they lack a good angle.  \nSpeed: Gordon can flip the field when he reaches the secondary untouched, but a safety can run him down after earning \n60-70 yards.  \nPower: Gordon keeps his feet moving through contact and generates forward momentum—even when a defensive tackle \nwraps him high at the entrance of a crease. He will force gang tackles from box defenders.  \nGordon has an effective stiff-arm. He can ward off all three levels of defenders with it. He’s at his best when he initiates the \ncontact with the stiff-arm so he can reach the defender early and knock the opponent to the ground as he turns the corner.  \n\n \n146 \nHe doesn’t accelerate into contact when he has an opportunity to lower his pads in a crease and meet the linebacker with \nforce and with a favorable angle of initial contact.  \nGordon will initiate contact and use good pad level to generate a push, but he doesn’t accelerate into the contact the way \ntop NFL backs do.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Gordon can generate a push against an undersized defensive end when he initiates contact with \nthe defender in the crease. He’ll bounce off direct contact from a safety at the end of a crease and force another defender to \nwrap him. He’ll stalemate linebackers heading downhill and both players have momentum into the collision.  \nIf a defender has the momentum downhill, Gordon doesn’t accelerate into the contact and it limits his effectiveness. When \nhe can at least drop the pads on a flat-footed linebacker while Gordon is heading downhill, Gordon can win the collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Gordon can bounce off indirect contact to his hips and legs from linebackers in the hole. He has \na capable balance-touch against glancing shots.  \nRoutes: Gordon will work with a quarterback breaking the pocket. He adjusts to the open space and continues to work \nthrough the open area to create a good target for his scrambling teammate.  \nGordon can work to depth better when running routes that break through the middle of the line. He tips off his intentions \nwith his breaks because he turns his head gradually to the quarterback rather than working to depth and snapping the turn.  \nStill, Gordon is a capable check-down/leak receiver. He sets up some screens effectively, but he must be more aware off \nblitzing defenders from his side of the field so he doesn’t tip off the route. He must influence the defender to push the \npocket before turning back to the quarterback.  \nHe has an effective shed when working downfield against a linebacker in the flat. Gordon will dive inside with his stems to \nset up off coverage.  \nReceiving: Gordon tracks wide routes over his shoulder and uses underhand technique with targets arriving at chest-height \nin these scenarios. He keeps his feet on the ground as he secures targets at chest level. Gordon can attack the ball with \noverhand position at chest level and with his arms away from his chest while on the run. He uses the correct attack based \non the position of the target and will extend his arms to the ball with underhand attack.  \nGordon can pluck targets with one hand using underhand attack over his shoulder.  \nGordon tracks the ball effectively when it is underthrown. He will slide and get his hands under the target, making the initial \ncatch. He must prove he can maintain security after contact in these situations. He must embrace the fall better.  \nGordon will catch and pierce downhill.  \nBlocking: Gordon will slide outside with his hips downhill so he’s working laterally toward his assignment while remaining \nsquare to the opponent. Gordon delivers quick chips to edge defenders as he exits the backfield. He drops his head in an \nattempt to deliver a hard hit with his pads and can miss the opponent or allow the opponent to swim over him.  \nGordon will work to the edge and cut large defensive ends with good technique—working inside-out and through the frame \nof the defender with height. He shoots through the target with his eyes up and times the shot effectively when working to \nhis right.  \nWhen working to his left, he can shoot too early and tip off the effort with his head down. This is the case with 2023 and \n2024 tape. When working to the right side or to an open lane up the middle, his timing is much better and he’s successful.  \nGordon identifies corner blitzes and works inside-out to force the defender around the pocket. He squares A-Gap pressure \nand delivers his hands with his elbows tight, but there’s no punch unless he’s leading with his head and pads.  \nAs a lead blocker and pass protector, Gordon is physical, but he drops his head and overextends into the contact, risking \ninjury and potentially getting blown up early on the collision. He also tips off blocks due to his overextensions.  \nEven when he doesn’t overextend with his initial attack, Gordon is prone to overextending with his follow-up strikes and \nthat gives his opponent and opening to win the interaction.  \nHe’s at his best when shielding defenders and approaching with finesse to turn a defender away from the ball carrier.   \n\n \n147 \nWhen Gordon earns contact, he aims for the chest and he keeps his feet moving during the contact.  \nGordon drops his head when chip-releasing. You never know if he sees the target and his misses too often.  \nBall Security: Gordon has 619 touches during the past 3 years at Oklahoma State and has fumbled 6 times—1 per 103.2 \ntouches. Gordon carries the ball away from the nearest pursuit, tucking the ball high to his frame and tight to his side.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: It’s likely a team that selects Gordon will be a gap-heavy scheme so you can probably \ngive him a “working” score of 80.5 and compare him to the tier of players in that range. It makes Gordon a mid-to-late pick \nin drafts with 7-9 rounds and a late-round pick in drafts with 4-6 rounds.  \n \nIf you’re conservative with your picks, it may be best to exclude Gordon from drafts before the NFL’s referendum on talent \nbecause you won’t have certainty about his landing spot and match with running scheme. Most teams run their share of gap \nplays so it’s not a huge risk to include Gordon in your draft plans before the NFL Draft.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMature short-yardage decision to attack one-on-one. \n• \nMature job sticking with play design to press and cutback, makes second-level defender miss. \n• \nFrequent overextension with pass pro \n• \nMust commit to the bounce  \n• \nProcessing: IDing and reacting with good judgment needed \n• \nOpen-field prowess \n• \nProcessing with non-gap/multiple choice options needs improvement \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n148",
        "analysis": "Ollie Gordon II is a talented running back with a complex profile.  His strengths lie in his size (6'1\", 226 lbs),  skill in space, and receiving ability out of the backfield. He possesses good contact balance and a strong stiff-arm, capable of breaking tackles and forcing gang tackles. His vision is also a strength, particularly in identifying pre-snap advantages and adjusting to penetration.  He's shown flashes of excellent acceleration and speed on the field, despite a less impressive NFL Combine performance.\n\nHowever, Gordon's game is hampered by inconsistencies. He overreacts to leverage, often bouncing runs away from designed plays and into unfavorable situations. He doesn't consistently accelerate into contact, failing to maximize his size and power.  His pass protection needs significant refinement, showing issues with overextension and a lack of a powerful punch. His route running could also use improvement, especially in terms of head placement and awareness of blitzing defenders.\n\nGordon's NFL success is highly dependent on scheme fit.  In a gap-blocking scheme, his strengths are better utilized, potentially making him a rotational starter or even a productive starter with improvement in his weaknesses.  In a zone-blocking scheme, his value significantly diminishes, possibly relegating him to a backup role.  His arrest for suspicion of DUI is also a significant concern, impacting his overall evaluation.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** The provided comparisons (Deuce McAllister, David Johnson, William Green) highlight a potential range of outcomes. McAllister represents the high-end potential if he excels in a power scheme, while Johnson and Green represent more realistic potential outcomes given his strengths and weaknesses.  The \"X\" suggests a level of unpredictability due to his inconsistencies.  The comparison spectrum points to a player who can be very good in the right situation but also could struggle in others.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB29 \nJersey No. 21 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/208 School: Cincinnati/LSU \nComparison Spectrum: Jaylen Warren - Ray Davis - X - Cody Schraeder \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78.1 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nPitt ‘24 \n• \nUCF ‘24 \n• \nArizona State ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Kiner reminds me a lot of Ray Davis and Jaylen Warren. He’s a confident tight-crease ball carrier with \nshiftiness and a combative mentality against contact.  \nKiner also gains my admiration because he has the old-school mentality that runners of my generation had far more often \nthan they do today: Kiner accelerates into collisions. Kiner wins collisions, carries tacklers, and drags wrap-ups because of \nhis approach.  \nWhen combining his ability to layer his voluminous toolbox of moves in succession with his attacking mentality, Kiner is an \nenjoyable ball carrier to watch and likely a favorite of his teammates.  \nWhen Kiner earns a big crease, he can force defensive backs to give chase. Kiner can flip the field before wrapped up. \nHowever, Kiner lacks top burst and often gets chased down or dropped before he can reach the open field.  \nKiner’s athletic ability is good enough to earn a reserve role on an active roster and even contribute productive carries as \npart of a committee. This may not happen until he improves his pass protection. He sets up late and overextends as a \nstand-up blocker and his shots as a cut blocker aren’t technically sound.  \nIf he improves here, Kiner could become a helpful second or third back in a starting rotation who can close out games or \ncreate yardage as a runner and outlet receiver.  \nVision: Kiner presses the lead blocker on off-tackle zone and cuts back toward the double team inside as he gets within a \nstep of the lead blocker. He can press within a step of the lead blocker. He’s a confident tight-crease runner.  \nThere are other zone runs where Kiner frequently presses no more than three steps from the blocker or line and begins a \ncutback or bounce far earlier than necessary. This forces him to make last-second movements after the bounce cutback that \nmight not have been necessary if he pressed longer with the original approach.  \nWhen in the second level and there’s a safety coming downhill and 4-6 yards away, Kiner opts for a spin rather than \ncontinue downhill and use his size and strength to win a collision or set up a more efficient move. The spin isn’t efficient or \nas effective at maximizing yardage in this situation.  \nKiner finds cutbacks and bounces in the second level and the secondary to extend runs. He must temper his effort to \nreverse field after breaking a tackle at the line of scrimmage that sends him backwards. Kiner lacks the juice to create in \nthis fashion.  \nKiner has lapses with setting up perimeter runs where he allows his path to be strung out by defenders when there was \nfavorable leverage for him to at least press inside to manipulate edge defenders so he could get around the corner. There \nwere also opportunities for Kiner to take the inside crease, get downhill, and avoid the defenders that had cut off the \noutside.  \nKiner sets up pullers well to the edge of the box to access a cutback.  \nElusiveness: Kiner alters his stride length to set up blocks on zone plays. He leaps or lifts his knees and feet high to work \nover low shots. He spins through wrap attempts to his torso.  \n\n \n149 \nKiner can layer moves in succession. He uses jump stops to set up changes of direction from a wide-angle path to a \ndownhill path. He combines a pressure cut to press one side of an interior gap, a jump cut to attack the gap, and a spin to \nwork away from leverage he attacked with the jump cut.  \nKiner likes using the spin, and he’s good at executing it, to beat box defenders clean or as a counter to him initiating \ncontact with his pads.  \nKiner can open his hips with the point of the toe to the boundary to change direction in traffic with economy. He has \neffective curvilinear speed around the short-side edge. He only needs one step to cut downhill at the edge of the box. He \ncan make a single lateral cut in succession to avoid the force defender and then the linebacker at the second level, two \nsteps later.  \nHe only needs two quick steps to transition downhill from the perimeter approach to the short-side corner.  \nAcceleration: Kiner can accelerate past defensive linemen and some linebackers to the far sideline.  \nSpeed: When working to the far sideline untouched, Kiner can hold off a safety working across the field for 15-20 yards \nbefore being run down.  \nPower: Kiner pulls through reaches to his legs. He can pull through wraps to his frame and legs. He can pull through \nmultiple reaches, wraps, and hits during a run. Defenses often have to gang tackle Kiner.  \nKiner’s stiff arm has the timing, location, and leverage to send defensive backs and linebackers to the ground – and \nviolently. He has done this with consecutive stiff arms to a corner and a linebacker on the same play within steps of each \nother.  \nWhen Kiner has momentum, he can drag a nose tackle 3-5 yards downhill with the DT on Kiner’s back.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Kiner accelerates into linebackers and safeties at the end of a crease at full speed with his pads \nlow. He runs through and over the defenders. He often initiates the contact with a forearm shiver and low pads.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Kiner bounces off hits to his shoulder and side from defensive linemen penetrating into the \nbackfield, and Kiner can continue forward as if he stiff-armed the defender. He can work through a hard hit through the side \nof his shin and knee form a safety, dipping his pads into the contact and following up with a balance-touch to continue \ndownhill.  \nRoutes: Kiner identifies the second level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He makes a friendly \ntarget for his quarterback.  \nReceiving: Kiner has tight overhand technique to catch targets at his pads. He tracks the ball over his shoulder and can do \nso wide of his frame. He can use underhand attack. He can high-point a target and turn into a hard hit to his chest.  \nKiner catches and pierces downhill when receiving the ball while breaking outside. He’s a check-down/leak/screen receiver.  \nBlocking: Kiner can slide to an interior gap from Pistol alignment, square a defensive tackle with a squat position, and \nthrow his hands with force into the chest of the defender. He overextends and it limits him to one shot and limits the impact \nof his strikes.  \nHe identifies B-Gap blitzes from defensive backs but can be late to square the opponent. He winds up taking contact and \ngetting driven into the quarterback’s lap. \nWhen he’s on-time identifying B-Gap pressure, Kiner delivers cut blocks with timing, height, and location across the frame. \nHe must shoot through the opponent. When he doesn’t, he finishes the block standing up and crossing the frame of the \nopponent. The opponent’s path was slowed, but he remains upright.  \nKiner slides to the edge and squares defensive ends with a squat stance. He overextends and leads with his head into the \nstomach of the defender and his arms and hands are too wide to make meaningful contact. The defender puts Kiner on his \nbackside with this approach.   \nKiner can be late to identify a delayed pressure or layered pressure and overruns where he should be, forcing him to \nreverse field and be late to block the pressure. He can get in the way but only to give his quarterback time to run.  \n\n \n150 \nHe sustains his blocks against some linebackers and most defensive backs. He can slow defensive linemen with a hard shot.  \nBall Security: Kiner carries the ball close to his chest. He uses is boundary-side arm. Kiner has 6 fumbles in 590 touches – \n1 per 98.3 touches. When excluding the fumble scored to him in the Pitt game where he was making a desperation lateral \nwith timing running out to keep the play alive, Kiner’s rate is 1 per 118.  \nDurability: Kiner was carted off with a rib or oblique injury during the first half of the UCF game in late September 2024. \nHe returned the following week and delivered a 100-yard effort.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Kiner is a late-round option in formats with at least 35-40 roster spots and practice \nsquads. He has enough of a ceiling to contribute, but unlikely as a long-term starter. \n \nIt’s probably best to add Kiner as a free agent after drafts unless the NFL’s referendum on Kiner is decidedly positive.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLayering moves in succession, reading leverage, and contact balance \n• \nContact runner and movement \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2021 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n151",
        "analysis": "Corey Kiner is a compact, powerful running back with a tenacious running style reminiscent of Jaylen Warren and Ray Davis.  His strengths lie in his ability to run between the tackles, win collisions, and consistently fall forward, even after contact. He displays a good understanding of leverage and can layer multiple moves in succession to elude defenders.  He’s also a capable receiver, showing reliable hands and the ability to make plays after the catch.\n\nHowever, Kiner's opportunities are limited by a lack of elite burst and top-end speed, often resulting in him being caught from behind. His pass protection needs significant improvement, currently hindering his potential to see consistent playing time.  His vision, while adequate, shows inconsistencies, particularly in zone running schemes where he sometimes cuts back too early.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power Running:** Excellent contact balance, power, and ability to fall forward after contact.  Excels at running between the tackles.\n* **Elusiveness:**  Can effectively utilize a variety of moves (spins, jump cuts) to avoid tackles.\n* **Receiving Ability:** Reliable hands and ability to contribute in the passing game.\n* **Toughness:** Displays an old-school mentality; attacks collisions rather than shying away from them.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Pass Protection:** This is crucial for increasing playing time at the NFL level.\n* **Refine Vision:**  More consistent decision-making in zone running schemes could lead to more explosive plays.\n* **Increase Burst/Speed:** While not lacking in this area completely, improvements here would greatly enhance his overall game.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Jaylen Warren:** Shares a similar build, running style (powerful, between-the-tackles runner), and ability to contribute on passing downs (though Warren's pass blocking is better).\n* **Ray Davis:** Similar in size and style; both are tough runners who can win in short-yardage situations.\n* **Cody Schrader:** A potential comparison based on physicality and style, though the profile doesn't explicitly detail the similarities.\n\nKiner projects as a late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent who could carve out a niche role as a short-yardage and goal-line back, or a change-of-pace back.  His success hinges on his ability to improve his pass protection and refine some aspects of his vision and decision-making.\n"

        "player_name": "DJ Giddens",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB30 \nJersey: No.31 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/212 School: Kansas State \nComparison Spectrum: Melvin Gordon - – X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 78 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nBYU ‘24 \n• \nOklahoma State ‘24 \n• \nCU ‘24 \n• \nArizona State ‘24 \n• \nCincinnati ‘24 \n• \nIowa State ‘24 \n \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Unless D.J. Giddens has been playing with a significant injury during his years at Kansas State, he \nmust decide whether he wants to be a thermostat or a light switch on the field. Giddens lacks intensity with how he \nperforms tasks – his attack, his pacing, and how he finishes are all areas where the intensity can be missing.  \nWhen the light switch is on, Giddens can look like a more explosive Melvin Gordon. When it’s off, Giddens looks like he’s \ndaydreaming that he’s on a couch with a drink in his hand imagining he’s Gordon.  \nGiddens can press creases and set up unblocked defenders with close forays toward them at the line. He can hit tight \ncreases decisively. When his mind is on a couch, Giddens doesn’t press creases deep enough and cuts back or bounces 3-4 \nsteps too early. This limits him to minimal gains.  \nWhen Giddens’ “light switch,” is off, he doesn’t attack creases decisively enough. Instead of “slow to the hole, fast through \nit,” Giddens is “slow through the hole, tentative through it.” As a gap runner, Giddens attempts cutbacks too often.  \nGiddens has all the moves you want from a starting running back. He gets his feet over low shots, violent sticks, sharp \npressure cuts with good hip mobility, and all the variety of jump stops and jump cuts to work laterally. When the light is on, \nGiddens sets up changes of direction by playing with pacing. When it’s off, everything is one speed and predictable.  \nGiddens’ timed speed is a little better than what we routinely see on the field, but that’s likely due to acceleration that \ndoesn’t match the top gear. Giddens has starter-caliber burst, but that too, doesn’t show up as frequently as it could.  \nGiddens’s passing-down work has potential. He’s a reliable pass-catcher with the exception of clap-attacking when using an \nunderhand position. Giddens is a speedbump of a blocker, meaning he’s a mild obstacle because he overextends and \ndoesn’t earn the first strike. He doesn’t control the chain of events.  \nGiddens has the talent to contribute at a high level. The NFL is usually demanding enough to weed out players who don’t \nhave thermostat mentalities at the skill positions. We’ll see if Giddens can develop that mentality, or at least duct-tape the \nlight-switch into the “on” position.  \nVision: Giddens presses into a defender’s advantageous leverage and gets within a step of the lineman and blocker before \ncutting back or bouncing the play in the opposite direction on zone runs. Giddens identifies edge penetration and veers \naway from it to set up his down blocks and pullers on gap runs.  \nGiddens presses lead blockers in the open field within a step of the block. He’ll hit tight creases decisively.  \nThere are zone runs where Giddens doesn’t press deep enough and he attempts the cut back 3-4 steps too early. This limits \nhis ability to maximize the potential of the run and often limits him to minimal gains that aren’t helpful to the team.  \nGiddens doesn’t attack creases decisively enough. There are too many scenarios where “slow to the hole, fast through it,” \ndegenerates to “slow through the hole, tentative through it,” because he’s looking for a bounce or cutback when he should \nbe attacking the safety.  \n\n \n152 \nGiddens attempts too many cutbacks on gap plays where he should have continued following the play as it was developing.  \nElusiveness: Giddens adjusts stride length and pacing to set up blockers after the exchange. He has an explosive stick to \nset up and elude safeties with a downhill angle of pursuit as Giddens exits the hole.  \nWhen in a tight crease, Giddens will turn his pads sideways to get skinny in the hole and avoid an unblocked defender. He \nalso opens his hips with one step and can do it as a transition from an east-west path to a north-south path.  \nGiddens lifts his feet and knees through shot shots and has the flexibility to kick his feet toward his backside to maintain \nbalance as he transitions through the contact to maintain his stride. He also has sharp pressure cuts with good hip mobility \nand leg extension that reminds me a little of Jonathan Taylor’s cuts.  \nGiddens has a nice double-up juke to set up gap creases before hitting them decisively. He has good shoulder and head \nfakes in the open field and pairs them well with sticks and other footwork jukes.  \nGiddens only needs two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach on runs to the short-side edge. \nGiddens has quick stop-start, jump cuts, and jump stops that set up creases or make defenders miss.  \nAcceleration: Giddens has the acceleration to beat defensive linemen when he reaches the second level. Giddens is a \ngliding runner who can accelerate past box defenders into the secondary. He has the acceleration to beat cornerbacks in the \nbox and sustain that separation as he reaches top speed.  \nSpeed: Giddens can turn the far-side corner on a linebacker, but he can’t outrun the defender up the boundary. However, \nGiddens can work through the middle of the line to the far-side flat and hold off the corner closest to that flat for 45-55 \nyards. He lacks the top-end speed to beat the angle of a safety playing over the top \nPower: Giddens pulls through reaches to his upper body. He uses a stiff arm to punch defenders reaching for his frame, \nforcing them to slide to his legs.  \nWhen wrapped, Giddens keeps his feet moving and generates a forward lean. He’ll also spin through wraps to his torso to \nextend for extra yardage. Giddens drops his pads into contact and initiates contact when heading downhill for a defender. \nDirect Contact Balance: Giddens bounces off flat-footed linebackers meeting him in the crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Giddens bounces off indirect contact to his frame from linebackers and lower-body hits from \nsafeties.  \nRoutes: Giddens will widen his stems to influence off-man coverage. When covered man-to-man and he spots the \nquarterback breaking the pocket, he’ll run off the defender to give his teammate a path to run.  \nAgainst zone coverage, Giddens identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a \nfriendly position for the quarterback.  \nReceiving: Giddens tracks the ball over his shoulder with overhand attack while breaking away from the ball and to the \nboundary. He uses the appropriate attack based on the location of the target. He can catch one-handed underhand over his \nshoulder on wide routes.  \nGiddens also uses high-point technique effectively and only leaves his feet as needed. He has effective catch and pierce \ntechnique when facing downhill at the catch point.  \nGiddens must avoid clap-attacking underhand targets. He leads to less secure catches and can squirt loose when hit hard. \nHe also has lapses with targets over his shoulder where  he allows the ball into his frame and uses an attack that is high/low \nand not uniform.  He has a good pullback with coverage at his back when turning behind his break path to make the catch.   \nBlocking: As a lead blocker, Giddens extends into the chest of a defender with his pads over his knees when lead blocking. \nHe misses blocks because he can over pursue an angle to the defender and because of the overextension. When he can set \nup with a squat and square position against pass rushers coming downhill, Giddens delivers his pads with force and timing \nthat stones the blitzing defender.  \nThe overextension remains a risk, but Giddens’ timing leads to effective strikes with his pads. Fortunately he doesn’t lead \nwith his head. Still, the overextension can lead to missed blocks or “speedbump” blocks. He also loses position when he \n\n \n153 \noverextends and he’s no longer square when he tilts his hips to strike with pads or a forearm. He has lapses with effort that \nleads to pressure that shouldn’t have been so easy for a defender to earn. \nHis hands are tight enough to get inside the defender’s pads. He uses an uppercut.  \nGiddens reads interior pressure off play-action and will at least earn a chest-to-chest position to shield the opponent. When \nassigned to edge pressure, Giddens sets up fast with a square and squat position and tight enough to the tackle that he \ndoesn’t allow a large inside lane.  \nGiddens reads safety and linebacker blitzes through A and B gaps effectively. He also considers Green Dawg pressure, \nincrementally working into the line and waiting to see if the defender pressures before leaving on his route.  \nHe times his cut blocks well and shoots through the defender’s legs with enough height to drop the opponent. He keeps his \nhead and eyes up. He does this well when picking up cross-blitzing linebackers.  \nGiddens will attempt to chip but he throws his body toward the defender and doesn’t close the gap enough to reliably strike \nthe opponent.  \nGiddens must learn when to forgo his outside assignment for a defender coming free from an assignment in the middle of \nthe field. He’ll pass up a free-running defender in the middle and slide outside for his assignment. This decision allows the \nmost immediate threat to reach the pocket.  \nGiddens drops his weight into a squat position against edge defenders. He squares the pressure and shuffles his feet with a \nwide stance to remain square.  \nBall Security: Giddens carries the ball high to his chest, but loose at the elbow. He covers the ball with both arms when \nwrapped. He won’t switch the ball from his right arm even if he’s running up the left boundary. If the play design is to the \nleft flat or numbers, Giddens will use his left arm.  \nHe has lost the ball when hit direction onto the ball. Giddens has 3 fumbles in 575 touches – 1 per 191.67 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Giddens likely earns draft capital based on his production and NFL Combine performance. \nHe’s a player I’d rather let drop to me at a value commensurate to my ranking, which means you’ll likely never get him. \nOnce the NFL determines Giddens’ landing spot, he could be worth an adjustment in value.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHip Mobility \n• \nContact Balance, Power, Spin \n• \nTight-Crease Attack and Open-Field Skill \n• \nOverextension with pass pro \n• \nCreative movement \n• \nNot pressing deep enough \n• \nToo tentative with Duo \n• \nPress on perimeter run and finish: Thermostat vs. Light Switch \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n154",
        "analysis": "DJ Giddens is an RB prospect with high potential but inconsistent execution.  His strengths lie in his elusiveness, possessing sharp cuts reminiscent of Jonathan Taylor, and his ability to accelerate past defenders.  He shows good vision in identifying creases and leveraging blockers. His receiving skills are also promising, though he needs to improve his underhand catching technique.  However, his biggest weakness is his inconsistency; he frequently lacks intensity and decisiveness, resulting in missed opportunities and minimal gains. He overextends in pass protection, becoming a \"speed bump\" rather than an effective blocker.  His top-end speed is also a question mark, although his acceleration is impressive.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusive:**  Excellent footwork, jump cuts, and sharp cuts.  Good hip mobility and ability to change direction quickly.\n* **Acceleration:**  Impressive burst to get past defenders, particularly in the second level.\n* **Receiving:** Reliable pass-catcher with potential, although he needs technical refinement.\n* **Vision:**  Identifies creases and blockers effectively, showing good understanding of run schemes.\n* **Power:**  Able to pull through arm tackles and maintain forward momentum.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Consistency:**  Needs to play with more consistent intensity and decisiveness.  His \"light switch\" mentality needs to be flipped permanently to \"on.\"\n* **Pass Protection:**  Must improve his technique to avoid overextending and becoming an ineffective blocker.\n* **Top-End Speed:** While his acceleration is good, he needs to improve his top-end speed to consistently outrun defenders.\n* **Underhand Catches:**  Refining his underhand catching technique would improve his reliability as a receiver.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Melvin Gordon (high-end potential with inconsistency issues).  The comparison highlights Giddens' potential to be a productive back but underscores his need for improved consistency and intensity.  The scout notes that when \"on,\" he looks like a more explosive Gordon, but when \"off,\" he's significantly less effective.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB31 \nJersey No. 28 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/192 School: Jackson State/Limestone \nComparison Spectrum: Clinton Portis - Aaron Jones – Jacory Croskey-Merritt/Tre Stewart \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 77 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nNew Mexico State ‘24 \n• \nLaTech ‘24 \n• \nWKU II ‘24 \n• \nOhio ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Stewart has the patience, footwork, acceleration, and speed of a future NFL contributor. He can run \ninside zone and gap plays. He sets up blockers effectively, but has lapses where he goes for the bounce-out when he should \nstick with the play design. Fortunately, Stewart manages this impulse well in short-yardage and red-zone situations.  \nStewart is a capable receiver. His only lapses come when high-pointing targets—he has a tendency to clap-attack when \nextending his arms that wide from his frame. Stewart does a lot of things right as a blocker, but he must develop better \nfootwork so he begins interactions with a balanced stance.  \nStewart’s ball security is a question mark. He had strong ball security at Limestone, but his record at Jacksonville State is \nbad enough for concern. If Stewart can refine his ball security and add about 10-15 pounds of muscle to his frame, he could \ncompete for a role as a committee back.  \nVision: Stewart reads leverage effectively on inside zone and hits creases decisively when there’s nothing to set up early. \nHe’s a confident tight crease runner who can press toward the outside man on a double team between the tackles and veer \ntight to the inside man’s inside shoulder to work away from penetration coming down the line and hit the crease for positive \nyardage.  \nStewart will press what looks like an open crease within a step of the hole and cut back after reading the leverage where \nhe’s pressing and manipulating a defender into it. He has lapses where he’s not judicious with bouncing plays outside. He \ntries to outrun defenders at the edge who can contain or string out the bounce. Stewart would be better off avoiding the \nbounce and pushing into his blockers to get what he can downhill.  \nStewart is more judicious when in the red zone in short yardage. He takes what the defense gives him and doesn’t gamble \nas a decision-maker. He has proven adept at setting up unblocked interior pursuit while still heading downhill. He navigates \ntraffic well.  \nStewart is patient with his puller on a gap play and will ride the correct hip until it’s time to press downfield and cutback \nwith a blocker ahead of the puller. He’s effective at running Counter, Power, and Toss. He will adjust stride length and \npacing to set up blocks.  \nElusiveness: Stewart can transition downhill to the far side flat on a perimeter run with two transition steps that are barely \ndiscernible. He has good curvilinear movement, and this limits how much he has to slow his stride to make these two quick \nsteps. He only needs one step to transition downhill as he arrives to the short-side edge.  \nStewart also has an effective two-quick juke after finishing this transition to make a safety miss over the top of him as he \ntransitions downhill and inside from this perimeter approach. It’s impressive movement, especially in succession.  \nStewart can flip his hips 90 degrees suddenly and in tight space. He has a spin but trying it in a 2-on-1 pursuit scenario to \nwork across two defenders next to each other isn’t the best choice of move.  \nHe can deliver a hard stick to set up a lateral cut to avoid penetration up the middle in the backfield. He also delivers a long \nstick downhill to set up the turning of his hips 90 degrees with the next step being the pointing of the toe. He can combine \nthat with a two-step turn 90 degrees to get back downhill in succession with that original move. \nAcceleration: Stewart has the acceleration to beat all three levels of the defense up the middle. \n\n \n155 \nSpeed: Stewart can sustain the top speed he reaches early with his acceleration when working up the middle.  \nPower: Stewart drops his pads into defenders at the end of creases and forces the defenders to wrap and hang on. Stewart \nwill keep his feet moving through wraps and pull them downhill for 2-3 yards if he doesn’t pull through the wrap. He’s a \ndetermined runner for his size and it’s best to wrap him low. Stewart uses a stiff arm to swat away reaches from defenders.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Stewart can win a head-on collision with a safety just after turning the corner on a run to the \nperimeter. He can stalemate a linebacker at the end of a crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots to his pads from safeties and linebackers hitting him from a \ndownhill angle to one side.  \nRoutes: On vertical routes, Stewart will counter inside leverage’s hands with a swat-swim combination. He’ll also use a \nshoulder reduction.  \nReceiving: Stewart can track a target over his shoulder with underhand position on a vertical route. He allows targets into \nhis frame with underhand position that arrive at the beltline.  \nWhen high-pointing downfield, Stewart is prone to clap-attacking targets. He must attack targets earlier and become \nconfident with using overhand attack. \nHe has success with using overhand attack over the shoulder and turning into a hard hit to the chest and maintaining \npossession. He executes a nice pull-back as well. Stewart can extend low and away from his frame to dig out targets below \nhis knees downfield.  \nBlocking: Stewart can work inside and deliver his hands tight with elbows bent into the chest with a defensive tackle and \nclose the gap well between them. He must work on his footwork so he has a balanced stance to deliver a punch with force \nand sustain contact. Stewart likes to lead with a shoulder and overextend without his feet in a balanced position.  \nWhen facing edge pressure, Stewart cultivates a square and squat position and shuffles his feet to move laterally with the \nassignment. When the defender works around Stewart, he can make contact with the inside shoulder and move his feet to \nride the defender outside the pocket.  \nStewart can slide against a linebacker and maintain a square position to strike with both hands and run his feet until the \ndefender redirects. He’ll earn good position inside the shoulder of a force player as a lead blocker around the edge of the \nbox. He can turn the defender because he gets tight to the shoulder.  \nStewart can help pick up a stunting tackle inside with a double team. He identifies corner blitzes and sets up well, but \noverextends into the collision.  \nBall Security: Stewart had 5 fumbles in 296 touches – 1 per 59.2 – at Jacksonville State. He had 279 touches in 2 years at \nLimestone. Overall, 5 fumbles in 575 touches – 1 per 115.  \nDurability: No significant injuries \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Stewart from afar until the NFL has its referendum on which prospects earn draft \ncapital. If Stewart gets drafted and lands in a good place, he might be worth a late-round pick in larger leagues. Otherwise, \nconsider him a free agent option to monitor on the waiver wire for leagues with larger roster allotments (35-plus), expanded \nsummer rosters, and practice squads.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n \n• \nFar-side perimeter, curvilinear control, two-step transition, two-quick, stiff arms \n• \nLate box read, cutback, hip flip, burst \n• \nNavigating heavy traffic early and late \n• \nTwo targets: easy drop and hard catch \n• \nHip-opener movement combo in succession \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n\n \n156",
        "analysis": "Tre Stewart is a running back prospect with a promising skill set but some areas needing improvement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusiveness and Acceleration:** Possesses excellent agility, quickness, and acceleration, allowing him to make sharp cuts and avoid tackles. He can transition smoothly from perimeter runs to inside runs.  His hip fluidity and ability to chain together evasive moves are highlights.\n* **Vision and Patience:**  Shows good vision in reading blocking schemes, particularly on inside zone runs. He's patient in waiting for holes to develop before committing to a run.  He's effective in short-yardage and red-zone situations.\n* **Power:**  Despite his size, he runs with surprising power, dropping his pads effectively and fighting through tackles. He's able to push defenders back and gain extra yardage.\n* **Receiving Ability:** Shows competency as a pass catcher, though high-pointing the ball needs refinement.  He's comfortable catching targets at different levels.\n* **Blocking:**  Shows potential as a blocker, especially in pass protection.  However, footwork and balance need improvement for more consistent impact.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Ball Security:**  His fumble rate at Jackson State is a significant concern that needs addressing. Improved ball security would greatly enhance his draft stock.\n* **Strength and Size:** Adding 10-15 pounds of muscle would improve his power and ability to withstand contact consistently.\n* **High-Pointing Catches:** Refining his technique on high-pointing catches will significantly improve his receiving ability.\n* **Blocking Footwork:** Improved footwork would enhance his blocking consistency and effectiveness.\n* **Avoiding Bounce Plays:** While capable of outside runs, he needs better judgment on when to stick to the designed play rather than bouncing outside against superior defenders.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report mentions Clinton Portis, Aaron Jones, and Jacory Croskey-Merritt as comparison points.  This suggests a player with a blend of power (Portis), agility and receiving skills (Jones), and perhaps similar all-around potential (Croskey-Merritt, a lesser-known comp). However, it’s important to note that  this is a spectrum, not a direct parallel.  He doesn't perfectly match any single player, but combines aspects of each.  His ultimate NFL success will depend on addressing his weaknesses.\n"

        "player_name": "Lan Larison",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB32 \nJersey No.3 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/215 School: Cal-Davis  \nComparison Spectrum: Isaiah Pacheco/Trey Benson - Marlon Mack/Cam Akers – X - Pierre Strong \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 76.5 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nCal’24 \n• \nOregon State ‘23 \n• \nHighlights vs. Illinois State ‘24 \n• \nCareer Highlights \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: No, Lan Larison is not Denver radio host Cecil Lammey’s nom de plume in an attempt to play running \nback in the NFL. Larison does sound like a comic book character Lammey would create – a state champion steer wrestler \nwith superpowers to control gravity who plays football to let off steam. He only uses his gravity-controlling superpowers in \nsubtle ways that the crowd can’t see.  \nLarison is explosive enough to play in the NFL. He’s a capable gap player who must refine his patience with zone schemes.  \nLarison has good footwork, mobile hips to change direction suddenly, and curvilinear speed to turn the corner without losing \nmuch pace. Once defenders catch up with Larison, they have more difficulty wrestling him to the ground than Larison has \nwith a steer.  \nLarison pulls through multiple reaches during runs. He gets his pads low and under wraps, which helps him take larger \ntacklers for a ride. Larison also wins or stalemates collisions with all three levels of defenders.  \nThe only time I catch on to this gravity manipulating character from Lammey’s demented mind is when Larrison catches the \nfootball. In addition to being a reliable pass-catcher, Larison wins targets in acrobatic fashion – sometimes at angles that \nseem like he channeled Brandon Lloyd or Randy Moss.  \nLarison’s greatest weakness is pass protection. He must learn to generate a balanced stance to begin blocks or else he sets \noff a negative chain of events where the defender is dictating each action.  \nLarison is likely a UDFA or late-round pick. If he makes an active roster, he has a chance to become a team’s third or fourth \nback and move his way up. If he gets a chance to see the field in the regular season, he could perform well enough to \ndevelop with the team.  \nTechnical: Larison has the arm and accuracy to throw an intermediate sideline curl with pressure closing during his release \nand deliver pinpoint to his WR versus man-to-man coverage.  \nVision: Larison identifies bounce opportunities during a run. He also has the game management maturity to stick with a \ngap play even with penetration bearing down on him at the exchange point when the down and distance is short yardage. \nHe’ll get the hard yards and not take an unnecessary risk trying to do so.  \nLarison identifies unblocked penetration as he works from the backfield toward the edge and finds the quick cutback for a \nchain-moving gain.  \nLarison must press deeper with zone runs. He’s a better gap runner at this point of his development.  \nElusiveness: When bending toward left end and trying to cut inside a puller or lead block, Larison has difficulty bending \ninside the lead blocker at the speed of his approach and runs into his blocker. Larison flips his hips well enough to \ncompensate after the small collision.  \nLarison spins through glancing shots or wraps to continue downhill. He gets his feet over defenders shooting for his legs as \nhe bounces away from their penetration up the middle into the backfield.  \nLarison alters his stride length and pacing to set up creases when working behind a puller on an interior gap play. He opens \nhis hips with the point of a toe to the boundary to make a quick bounce away from pursuit in the backfield.  \n\n \n157 \nLarison has curvilinear speed to reach the edge and turn the corner on a run to the far-side perimeter or a near-side \nperimeter play. He makes a two-step transition downhill from a boundary approach just at the edge of the box. He has a \nsharp pressure cut in the open field to force a safety coming downhill to miss his pursuit angle.  \nLarison hurdles defenders shooting for his waist in the open field and coming downhill where Larison has the angle to time \nthe leap.  \nAcceleration: When there’s an open crease into the second level, Larison can hit it and accelerate past all three levels of \nthe defense from the middle of the line to the far-side boundary. \nSpeed: Larison can hold off a safety in the middle of the field for 25-30 yards before chased down.  \nPower: Larison pulls through reaches to his lower legs from linebackers. He can force gang tackles at the second level of \nthe defense. He keeps his feet when box defenders wrap him high. Larison drops his pads under linemen when working into \na line where there is no discernible crease.  \nLarison can be late to deliver a stiff arm on a pursuit defender as he works to the boundary and the effort slows him down \nwithout a positive return. He could have continued running without slowing down and potentially worked through a reach \ninstead. Larison can bounce off multiple reaches and glancing shots when working downhill and facing D-1 defenders.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He wins collisions with safeties meeting him downhill and he generates a push forward. He can \nstalemate a D-1 DT in the hole and work away from the defender after the contact.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Larison bounces off glancing shots to his frame from safeties. He also bounces off glancing \nshots from backside pursuit of a defensive tackle hitting him in the side. He can stalemate the hit and work free of the wrap. \nHe can also attack one side of a defensive tackle in the crease and generate a stalemate. Larison delivers a hard forearm \nshiver to knock safeties to the ground coming over the top from the backside for a collision up the boundary.  \nRoutes: Larison identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He presents a friendly \ntarget to the quarterback. He has a capable wipe when countering the hands of a defender on a vertical route.  \nWhen working across a zone, he waits to show his eyes to the quarterback until he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender. \nLarison also tempos his breaks.  \nReceiving: Larison attacks targets at the numbers with overhand position close to his chest. He tracks the ball with \noverhand position away from his frame while breaking toward a defensive back. He can take a glancing shot to his chest \nand side as he makes a catch like this and maintain balance and possession of the ball.  \nHe catches targets at his beltline with underhand position. He can make these catches at the earliest window away from his \nframe.  \nLarison can reach behind his frame behind his back hip to catch a target with one hand in underhand attack as he’s breaking \nin the opposite direction.  \nHe displays late hands with targets tracking over his back shoulder with a defender tight to his inside hip and making \ncontact to Larison’s chest. He also makes the Brandon Lloyd/Randy Moss/Odell Beckham one-handed high-point in stride \nacross the middle.  \nLarison can embrace the fall after going airborne for his target. When he has lapses catching the ball, it’s focus drops with \ntargets into his frame.  \nBlocking: Larison delivers chips with enough force to move a box defender or slow their progress up field. As a standup \nblocker in one-on-one situations, Larison doesn’t close the gap enough to set his feet and it forces him to overextend to \nclose the gap.  \nIt makes his efforts off-balance. He misses his strikes on some assignments because of it or the block becomes an all-or-\nnothing effort or a temporary speed bump in favor of the pass rusher.  \nAs a lead blocker, Larison will close the gap on a defensive end, earn tight hands into the chest, and push. His feet are not \nin a balanced position to generate force to sustain the effort.  \n\n \n158 \nLarison cut blocks defensive ends. He shoots through contact with enough height but can only reach the inside leg when the \ndefender is at the edge and Larison is working from the middle.  \nBall Security: Larison has 7 fumbles in 837 career touches over 5 years – 1 per 119.6 touches. Larison carries the ball high \nto his chest but as he changes direction the ball drifts from his frame and he begins to swing the ball. He has lapses where \nhe doesn’t switch the ball to his boundary-side arm in the open field.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Larison from afar until the NFL Draft. Once that event determines his draft \ncapital, Larison might be worth a late-round pick in large leagues (40-plus roster sizes) or a free agent worth adding to \nleagues with expanded summer rosters.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nAcceleration and speed \n• \nThrowing an intermediate timing route vs. man and pressure \n• \nOne-handed high-point on crosser \n• \nLan Larison Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n159",
        "analysis": "Lan Larison is a running back prospect with intriguing potential but significant flaws.  His RSP ranking of RB32 reflects this duality.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Explosive Plays:** Larison possesses impressive explosiveness, acceleration, and curvilinear speed, allowing him to reach the edge and break tackles. He showcases excellent acceleration through creases.\n* **Power and Balance:** He's a powerful runner who wins collisions with defenders at all levels, pulling through tackles and maintaining balance even against larger opponents.  He displays good direct and indirect contact balance.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  A surprisingly capable receiver, Larison excels at high-pointing the ball and making acrobatic catches, drawing comparisons to players like Brandon Lloyd and Randy Moss. He shows good route-running skills.\n* **Vision (in certain situations):**  He identifies bounce opportunities and shows good game management in short-yardage situations.  He's adept at finding cutback lanes.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Zone Running:**  While a capable gap runner, he needs to improve his patience and press deeper into zone schemes to maximize his potential.\n* **Pass Protection:**  His pass protection is a major weakness.  Improving his stance and technique is crucial for his NFL viability.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumble rate isn't alarmingly high, improving his ball carrying technique (especially when changing direction) will reduce risk.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Pass Protection:** A significant area needing improvement.\n* **Zone Running Patience:** Needs to trust the blocking schemes more.\n* **Ball Security:** Prone to fumbling when changing direction or not securing the ball properly.\n* **Blocking:**  While he can deliver effective chips, his one-on-one blocking needs refinement.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report offers a wide range of comparisons, suggesting a player with inconsistency and a lack of one dominant skillset:\n\n* **High-End:** Isaiah Pacheco (similar explosiveness) and Trey Benson (power).  These represent potential *if* he fixes his weaknesses.\n* **Mid-Range:** Marlon Mack and Cam Akers (versatility but with consistency issues). This is a more realistic assessment of his current skillset.\n* **Low-End:** Pierre Strong (speed and agility but lacking in other areas). This is the baseline, should his deficiencies remain.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nLarison projects as a late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent. His success in the NFL hinges on significantly improving his pass protection and zone-running patience. If he can do so, his explosive plays and receiving ability give him a chance to carve out a role as a third-down back or change-of-pace runner.  However, if his flaws persist, he might struggle to make an NFL roster.\n"

        "player_name": "Peny Boone",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB33 \nJersey No.13 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/232 School: UCF / Toledo / Maryland  \nComparison Spectrum: A.J. Dillon – Anthony Dixon – X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 76.1 =  Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nIllinois ’23 No.11 \n• \nSan Jose St. ‘23 \n• \nMiami (Oh) ‘23 \n• \nFlorida ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Boone is a big, power, and nimble runner with intriguing instincts and good hands, but he has some \nsignificant issues holding him back from becoming a compelling prospect. Boone is an instinctive runner in the sense that he \nhas a good feel for reading and reacting to defenders as play unfolds. He’s also a strong game manager in key situational \nscenarios.  \nWhen Boone’s decision-making has lapses, it’s because he can be more focused on reading what’s immediately happening in \nfront of him with a defender instead of letting the play develop and working within its scope. If Boone focused on setting up \nblockers into defenders instead of reacting to one defender at a time, he’d have more success with a wider variety of plays.  \nBoone does this well pre-snap. He can read the box count of the defense and make an appropriate decision with a potential \ncutback. He also limits his penchant for cutbacks and bounces in the red zone. If he can do more to set up blocks, especially \non plays like windback, he could become a star-caliber decision-maker.  \nThere’s a fair bit of Jerome Bettis is Boone’s game because of his footwork. He can drop his weight, flip his hips, and alter \nhis stride to set up blockers and/or avoid defenders. He’s a quick mover with precise feet.  \nBoone, like Bettis, can run through box defenders. He’ll pull through reaches and wraps, and he’ll bounce off hits.  \nBoone has enough build-up speed to beat safeties with an opportune crease downhill. His acceleration isn’t strong enough to \nturn the corner for long on linebackers.  \nOne of the most compelling aspects of Boone’s game is his pass-receiving. He has skills as a route runner against man-to-\nman coverage and he has the soft hands to make adjustments to the ball.  \nBoone takes an “all-or-nothing” approach with his attack of assignments as a pass protector. This works well in college \nbecause of his size, but it doesn’t project nearly as well for the NFL.  \nPass protection and ball security are the two things holding Boone back from becoming a compelling late-round or UDFA \noption. Boone loses the ball at a rate of once every 46 touches. This unacceptable security and one that could get him cut \nfrom a team.  \nIf Boone fixes the ball security woes and refines his pass protection, he could be a camp sleeper and eventually a situational \ncontributor or co-starter.  \nVision: Boone works behind his pulling guard, reads the leverage of the defense on the blocks and attacks open space. He \ndoesn’t attack with patience when he has a wind back blocker. Boone barrels ahead of the defender and attacks the crease \na linebacker will fill as he hits the hole. This can also be the case when working with two pullers—he won’t set a pace for the \nsecond puller to get ahead of him.  \nWith gap plays, he can press within a step of his pullers to set up a cutback. He identifies advantageous leverage for the \ndefense at the edge and fins the cutback inside.  \nBoone can identify cutbacks on gap plays, reading the leverage of defenders and identifying early penetration into the \nbackfield.  \n\n \n160 \nHe identifies interior penetration during the exchange and can formulate a solution to avoid a defender meeting him at the \nexchange point.  \nBoone displays some ability to read a pre-snap box count and decide appropriately on a cutback to begin a run. In the red-\nzone, Boone manages the field effectively, avoiding cutbacks or bounces when creases are filled. Instead, he attacks the \nsoft spot of the play design and gets what he can with a push into the clogged line.  \nBoone is also efficient with his movement against penetration in short-yardage scenarios.  \nElusiveness: Boone shortens his stride to set up the cutback lane inside his pullers that the force defenders play-side \npenetrated and cut off. Boone works to the far-side edge of the box and drops his weight to transition downhill without any \nadded steps. When he doesn’t drop his weight, he needs two small steps.  \nHe can adjust his pacing to set up creases, baiting penetration into his press.  \nBoone has the body control at his size to sell out with a dive over a defensive back with full extension for the goal line. He \ncan open his hips at the second level while in full stride downhill to turn 90 degrees without added steps.  \nBoone has a tight spin in the backfield after the exchange against interior penetration and can avoid defensive linemen \nwithin 1-2 steps of him.  \nHe can jump cut at the line of scrimmage. He has a quick stick to avoid some of the incoming contact from a penetrating \ndefensive tackle early in the exchange.  \nAcceleration: Boone can reach the far-side edge against box defenders but he won’t get too far downfield before a \nlinebacker chases him down. \nSpeed: If Boone gets a runway downhill, he can open up and beat some safeties downhill.  \nPower: Boone can pull through reaches from linebackers. He drops his pads into defensive ends to generate a push \ndownhill for extra yardage.  \nBoone keeps feet moving through contact to carry defenders downfield. It doesn’t happen frequently enough to award him \nthe highest tier, but Boone has run through multiple reaches and/or hits during his career. It happens when he has \nmomentum downhill.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Boone can barrel over a linebacker, attacking his pads and taking one side of the defender’s \nframe. He runs through the hit and takes the defender to his back.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Boone bounces off indirect shots to his hip from a linebacker coming down the line. He’ll drop \nhis pads on linebackers meeting him at the corner of a perimeter run and knock the inside linebacker to the turf with the hit \nwithout breaking stride. He can hit a defensive end in the chest and continue forward, forcing the end to wrap and drag \nBoone to the ground.  \nBoone runs through a safety’s hit to his side and pads without breaking stride—even when the safety has a downhill \nrunway. When a hit breaks his stride, Boone has an effective balance-touch to regain it or at least prolong his movement \ndownhill before ultimately falling.  \nRoutes: Boone delivers a sudden double up at the top of stems against off-coverage but must develop more artistry with \npatience to precede the suddenness. The stems also need greater exaggeration in terms of range of movement.  \nBoone’s double up works well against outside shade when he counters the linebacker’s hands with a quick shed. His two-\nquick has excellent patience and suddenness. He includes a well-executed peek with his head and frame. Boone can tell an \nefficient story.  \nHe also snaps the turn on the break. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, he works with his scrambling quarterback.  \nBoone identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly position to his \nquarterback.  \n\n \n161 \nReceiving: Boone tracks the ball over his shoulder and away from his frame with overhand attack without leaving his feet. \nHe also extends his arms away from his waist for targets with underhand position. He has soft hands and makes fingertip-\nfirst catches.  \nBoone can turn behind his break path and attack the ball tight to his back shoulder near his hip with underhand position as \nhe’s running downfield. He must learn to execute a pullback against the trailing defender instead of taking a hit to his chest. \nHe has proven he can still maintain possession, but it’s not optimal.  \nHe catches and pierces downhill when attacking the ball while facing the quarterback.  \nBlocking: Boone shuffles his feet in a wide and squat stance to square himself to an assignment. Boone keeps his hands \ntight with his arms bent at the elbow. He rolls upward through the hips as he uppercuts tight to the defender.  \nAlthough Boone can deliver uppercuts with tight hands and hip roll through the punch, he defaults too often to strikes with a \nshoulder into the chest where he angles his torso so the hit results in an all-or-nothing interaction. With his size, it’s most \noften the “all” in an “all-or-nothing” outcome in favor of Boone. The force Boone generates can give him position to follow \nup if necessary. This won’t happen as often in the NFL and could turn out far more negative.  \nWhen one-on-one with an edge defender taking a wide runway, Boone can overextend and not see what he’s hitting—only \npartially hitting the opponent with his forearm. When he has a lapse like this during a game, he corrects this tendency with \ngreater patience to let the defender meet him halfway before closing the gap with aggression.  \nIf he can work to the defender after the defender sets his path, Boone closes the gap fast and delivers a strike with his \nhands tight to the opponent’s chest.  \nBoone has good timing off the edge to work across and through a linebacker with his cut blocks. He earns good height and \ndoesn’t drop his head. He can shoot in the opposite direction that’s ideal for the path of the defender and miss the block.  \nHe also gets deep enough in the A-Gap to cut a cross-blitzing LB. He can get a little further across the defender’s frame but \nthe height is good and he shoots through the target.  \nBoone delivers hard chips inside on defensive linemen and linebackers before releasing on a route or as a lead blocker for \nhis quarterback on a designed run. He’ll follow up downfield with a nice strike on a safety 10-12 yards later.  \nBoone can peel off a double team inside on a defensive tackle and works to the linebacker.  \nBall Security: Boone has 9 fumbles in 433 touches – 1 per 48 touches – between 2020-2024. \nBoone carries the ball high to his chest and – more the exception than the rule – tight to his side. The elbow comes loose \nfrom his side when he’s forces to fight for yardage with dynamic movement. \nHe uses the boundary-side arm and can take a defender raking the ball and the ball-carrying arm. He can carry the ball with \neither arm.  \nWhen Boone attacks a defender downhill, he wraps both arms around the ball.  \nDurability: In 2024, Boone missed games in the second half of the year with a calf strain. He had offseason shoulder \nsurgery heading into 2024 and missed spring practice. He missed the first week of the season with a concussion.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Boone from afar until we see if he earns draft capital or a UDFA contract. If Boone \nsigns with a team, he should be on your list as a summer waiver-wire target for expanded preseason rosters if you have \nmore than 40 spots and a practice squad.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nTracking, attack, athletic finish \n• \nReads the box, immediate cutback, contact balance \n• \nPatient but sudden two-quick, peek, snaps turn \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n\n \n162",
        "analysis": "Peny Boone is a powerful, nimble running back with intriguing instincts and good hands, but his inconsistent ball security and pass protection are major concerns.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power and Nimble Footwork:** Boone possesses a Jerome Bettis-like running style, capable of running through tackles and exhibiting impressive footwork to set up blocks and avoid defenders.

More consistent decision-making would unlock his full potential.\n* **Become a Camp Sleeper:** If he addresses his weaknesses, he has a chance to become a valuable camp player and potentially a situational contributor or even a co-starter.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Ball Security:**  A high fumbling rate is a major red flag that could lead to him being cut from a team.\n* **Pass Protection:** Aggressive but inconsistent pass protection technique needs significant improvement to be NFL-ready.\n* **Acceleration:** While possessing build-up speed, his acceleration isn't elite, limiting his ability to consistently outrun linebackers on outside runs.\n* **Durability:** He's experienced several injuries, raising concerns about his long-term health.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **A.J. Dillon:**  Shares a similar build and power running style, though Dillon's pass protection and ball security were likely more consistent in college.\n* **Anthony Dixon:**  A comparison highlighting the potential for a powerful, between-the-tackles runner who may lack the elite speed and agility of top-tier backs.\n* **Jerome Bettis:** Boone's footwork and ability to run through contact draw comparisons to the legendary \"Bus,\" although Bettis’s overall game was likely more polished.  This comparison focuses primarily on running style rather than overall skillset.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBoone possesses intriguing physical tools and flashes of high-level play.  However, his significant issues with ball security and pass protection need immediate and substantial improvement if he wants to make an NFL roster.  He's a high-risk, high-reward prospect whose future depends heavily on his ability to address these weaknesses.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB34 \nJersey: No.24 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/201 School: Mississippi/SMU \nComparison Spectrum: Devonta Freeman – Kyren Williams - - JaMycal Hasty - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.6 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nDuke ‘25 \n• \nLSU ‘24 \n• \nGeorgia Tech ‘23 \n• \nAlabama ‘23 \n• \nArkansas ‘23 \n• \nAuburn ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Bentley is a late-round pick with a high floor of skills and talents, but his athletic ceiling is limited \ncompared to the next two players ranked after him. If the parties selecting Bentley know they are seeking a reliable \nreceiver from the backfield with wise decision-making and the ability to create with strong footwork and quickness, they are \nmaking a good decision.  \nIf the goal is to select a running back with a high enough ceiling to become one of the leading weapons in the offense on a \nweekly basis, Bentley lacks that sustainable talent. His acceleration and speed would be good enough if he were a larger \nback with top-end power and contact balance, but that’s not the case.  \nBentley is a capable committee option who earns passing-down duties if he improves his blocking. A team will project \nBentley as a receiver who the offense can use for outlet passes, check-downs, screens, and RPOs. And if the defense sniffs \nout the play, the offense can audible to the run and Bentley should have the advantage due to his agility and wisdom with \nsituational management as a ball carrier.  \nCould Bentley surprise and become the next Kyren Williams or Devonta Freeman? It’s possible, especially if he develops as \na pass protector. If Bentley lands on a team with an excellent offensive line and his decision-making reliability and \nconsistency appeals to a head coach.  \nVision: Bentley is a decisive runner behind lead blockers and double teams. He sets up lead blockers with good timing. He’s \npatient with baiting unblocked defenders into blocks.  \nWhether it’s zone or gap, Bentley presses within a step of his blocks to set up bounces, cutbacks, and defenders into blocks. \nWhen working a perimeter run, Bentley presses an inside lane to freeze downhill pursuit that’s unblocked so he can get \noutside.  \nIn short-yardage scenarios with condensed boxes and tight creases, Bentley takes what’s in front of him and keeps his feet \nso his teammates can rally to the ball and generate a push. He attacks tight creases in these scenarios. \nBentley identifies penetration early enough to elude the defender and find a downhill crease to mitigate a loss.  \nElusiveness: Bentley has sharp pressure cuts to slash into open creases. He sets up pullers on gap plays with adjustments \nto his stride length. He’s a slippery back who can alter stride length and pace and layer moves in succession to make \nmultiple defenders miss in a compressed area. He knows how to be patient, but sudden, with movement and knows how to \naccelerate through his cuts.  \nBentley layers pace changes, spins, sticks, stop-start jukes, and jump cuts in a tight space to defeat multiple runners. He \nalso has curvilinear speed and opens his hips with efficiently to bounce away from downhill pursuit in tight spaces.  \nBentley only needs two quick steps to bend downhill and inside containment when it’s cutting him off between the tackles.  \nBentley gets his feet and knees high to work past low shots to his feet.  \nAcceleration: Bentley has the acceleration to work past unblocked defensive ends to the perimeter and turn the corner into \nthe secondary. He beats cornerbacks and linebackers around the far-side edge and turns the corner.  \n\n \n163 \nSpeed: Bentley has long speed—enough to outrun safeties and some cornerbacks in the open field. When he has an early \nlead, he can sustain separation against defensive backs. \nPower: Bentley pulls through reaches to his upper body from defensive linemen. He keeps his pads down and has good \nforward lean in tight creases and short yardage situations.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Bentley stalemates linebackers in the open field when neither has much momentum into the \ncollision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Bentley initiates contact with a forearm shiver to take on defenders trying to cut him in the \nopen field. He can ride over the top of the contact, if not keep his footing and continue forward.  \nWhen Bentley as downhill momentum he can stalemate the hit from a defensive end in backside pursuit and linebackers \nmeeting him downhill.  \nRoutes: Bentley works into open space against zone coverage when the first break doesn’t earn him a target. He identifies \nthe second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly position for the QB to target.  \nBentley uses his eyes to peek back to the quarterback and sell the linebacker on the shallow route before taking him vertical \non a bullet or wheel route.  \nBentley has a patient but sudden two quick release at the top of stems against linebackers playing over the top.  \nBentley can drop his weight into a three-step break. He can cultivate more snap and work on accelerating into the break.  \nReceiving: Bentley catches belt-high targets with underhand position. He uses overhand position at the numbers. Bentley \ntracks the ball over his shoulder effectively on vertical routes. Bentley can turn during a vertical route and track the ball \nbehind him, extending wide for the target.  \nBentley obeys the ball to determine the path for catching and piercing downhill. He keeps his feet on the ground for targets \nthat don’t require him to leave his feet.  \nBlocking: Bentley sinks his hips as a lead blocker and delivers his hands with elbows bent without overextending. He can \ndeliver a strike to a defensive tackle or defensive end and shield the opponent from the ball carrier. Bentley is an effective \nlead blocker working the edge for his quarterback. He can use a one-arm technique to seal an edge defender and the work \nup the secondary to square and bury his pads into the chest of the safety. He has great timing with delivering his pads into \nthe chest of backside pursuit and can rock a linebacker or safety with his strikes as he leads downhill.  \nAs a pass protector, Bentley works to the edge on double-team assignments and earns tight position to the outside shoulder \nof the tackle. He shuffles his feet with a wide stance to remain square with the opponent, and he delivers his hands tight \nenough to strike the opponent’s chest. He overextends a bit into the strike.  \nBentley must learn to strike with his hands and deliver the strike with his hips rolling through the punch so he can have a \nshot of sustaining the block. Because he is prone to overextending against larger defenders, he gets beaten to the punch. \nHe does not hold up well against A-Gap pressure from linebackers who generate momentum and/or earn the first punch.  \nAnother issue for Bentley as a stand-up blocker is that he doesn’t shuffle his feet to remain square and in a wide stance. He \npivots his upper body to adjust to the defender after his initial set up. When he strikes, he’s not balanced and square to the \nopponent. This makes it easier for defenders to work past the initial contact.  \nBentley delivers healthy shots to defenders when chip-releasing from the line. The strike has gravity but he doesn’t knock \nthe opponent from his teammate’s block.  \nBall Security: Bentley carries the ball high to his chest and can use the boundary-side arm, but he has too many lapses on \nplays designed to the left side to grade it as a good habit. He tightens his elbow to his side in traffic he sees. \nBentley has shown that he will switch the ball to his boundary arm on a cutback, but I need to see more of him using his left \narm to award him credit.  \nHe can take contact to the ball and ball-carrying arm and maintain possession at the end of runs. Bentley’s fumble rate is 1 \nper 138.25 or 4 in 553 touches.  \n\n \n164 \nDurability: Toe injury in summer of 2024. Wrist injury cost him multiple games in 2022.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I’d rather consider Bentley when the first round of waivers begins in the offseason and \nroster sizes are expanded than draft him late. The exception is rosters with over 40 players and a deep practice squad.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLead Blocker \n• \nFinish and contact balance in the open field \n• \nAcceleration \n• \nSlippery and creative \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2020 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n165",
        "analysis": "Ulysses Bentley IV is a late-round NFL prospect projected as a committee back with a high floor but limited ceiling.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Elusiveness:**  Bentley possesses excellent vision, patiently setting up blocks and making decisive cuts. He's highly elusive, utilizing sharp cuts, pace changes, and effective jukes to evade defenders in tight spaces.\n* **Receiving Skills:**  He's a capable receiver out of the backfield, showing good hands, route-running ability, and the capacity to track the ball well. He excels in short-to-intermediate routes, making him a valuable asset in passing situations (RPOs, screens, check downs).\n* **Contact Balance (Indirect):**  Bentley shows a knack for initiating contact and maintaining balance, especially when hitting defenders on the move.  He's effective at absorbing indirect contact and staying upright.\n* **Lead Blocking:**  He displays good timing and technique as a lead blocker, effectively sealing edges and delivering strikes to create running lanes for teammates.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Pass Protection:**  Improving his pass protection is crucial for increasing his overall value. He currently struggles against larger, powerful defenders due to overextending and poor footwork.  Consistency here could significantly elevate his draft stock.\n* **Ball Security:** Though his fumble rate is low, consistency in carrying the ball with both arms is needed.\n* **Power:** While he demonstrates adequate power in short-yardage situations, enhancing his power to consistently break tackles would boost his overall game.  He needs more power to match his speed and agility.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited High-End Athleticism:**  His acceleration and speed are good, but not exceptional for an NFL running back, particularly given his size.  He doesn't possess the breakaway speed to consistently outrun defenders in the open field.\n* **Durability:** A history of toe and wrist injuries raises concerns about his long-term health.\n* **Power (Direct):** His direct contact balance is only average, leaving room for improvement in breaking through tackles consistently.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares him to Devonta Freeman, Kyren Williams, and JaMycal Hasty.  This suggests a player who excels in passing situations and as a change-of-pace back but may lack the power and overall athleticism to be a true workhorse.  He's likely to be a valuable contributor in a committee backfield.  The comparison to Hasty is particularly relevant due to the similarity in size and skill set, but Bentley potentially possesses better receiving capabilities.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB35 \nJersey: No.7 \nHeight/Weight: 5’8”/205 School: UCF  \nComparison Spectrum: Tarik Cohen - X – Ito Smith \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.4 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nSanders is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nBoise State ’23  \n• \nKansas State ‘23 \n• \nTexas Tech ‘23 \n• \nColorado ‘24 \n• \nFlorida ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A dual-threat high school quarterback and a left-handed thrower, Harvey switched to running back in \ncollege. He’s a dynamic mover with sudden athlete ability in tight space. He also has the skill to remain tight to a lead \nblocker in a crease so he can get downhill while staying away from pursuit coming down the line.  \nHarvey is a good cutback runner who presses deep into zone blocking, sets up double teams on Duo, and understands the \nleverage he’s reading on Power. Harvey must learn to limit his attempts to seek cutbacks on Gap plays. He misses what’s \navailable with the design and works himself into bad situations.  \nThis is the learning curve that a lot of young players with Harvey’s dynamic agility and quickness face. Harvey has excellent \nhip mobility, body control to corner the perimeter at top speed, and footwork to transition 90 degrees with no more than 1-\n2 steps. The diminutive Harvey also adds head and shoulder fakes into the mix, making him a slippery, creative, and \ndangerous runner who gets lost in traffic and turns defenders around in the open field. \nAlthough Harvey is short, he has a low center of gravity and good lower-body strength. He has the contact balance to \nbounce off hits with linebackers and safeties. He can get under hits and wraps, using his lower body to push for additional \nyardage. He’s not a power back, but he can do work between the tackles on a situational basis.  \nIf a team wants to get the most from Harvey as a runner, he does his best work with Zone, Draw, and Duo.  \nHarvey is a skilled receiver who adjusts well to the ball and has some promise as a route runner against underneath \ncoverage. He’s a player that his offense will want matched with a linebacker underneath.  \nThe only notable flaw with Harvey as a receiver is a penchant for focus drops. He’s anticipating the opportunity to turn \ndownfield and do what he does best and forgets to look the ball into his hands and secure it to his frame.  \nPass protection needs work. Harvey is a one-and-done blocker, whose strikes lack the position for him to sustain his efforts. \nIt’s most likely Harvey will be in routes more often than pass protecting but if called into action, the quarterback would be \nwise to know he has even less time than anticipated with Harvey protecting him in the backfield.  \nHarvey is one of multiple backs in this tier who would be closer to a rotational starter in score if his ball security wasn’t on \nthe cusp of unacceptable. If Harvey can curtail the fumbles and either land in an offense that doesn’t use Gap blocking or \nimprove his decision-making in the scheme, the rest of his skills make him a potential weekly contributor with statistical \nvalue.  \nVision: Harvey finds cutbacks on inside zone, pressing away from the double team within 1-2 steps of his front side \nblockers and then sliding laterally across the back of his double team and around the backside corner.  \nHe sets up double teams on Duo. He reads leverage and tries to set up pullers on Power.  \nHowever, Harvey has a penchant for seeking the cutback on Gap plays rather than taking what’s available and limiting his \npotential gains because he went for the big play against worse leverage than what he was avoiding. He takes the cutback \ntoo often on non-Gap designs as well.  \n\n \n166 \nHarvey appears more comfortable running zone, draw, and Duo than Gap blocks. Once he gets into space, Harvey isn’t as \nsudden of an accelerator as his short-area quickness would lead you to believe, but his burst is good enough to get him past \nbox defenders. Once he’s in the secondary, Harvey has a second gear that’s elite.  \nWhen working around the perimeter, he’ll dip with a head and shoulder fake to the inside and set up a receiver’s block on a \ndefensive back before bouncing outside.  \nElusiveness: Harvey has excellent mobility with his hips. He can drop his weight to a stop, extend a long stride downhill \nand away from pursuit, and then jump cut laterally to the edge.   \nHarvey can point the toe to slide outside a defender in combination with a jump cut.  \nHarvey has effective curvilinear speed that can get him around the play-side edge on a bounce-out and work inside the \ncornerback pursuing from the flat.  \nHarvey gets his feet and knees high to avoid low shots. He spins through contact when wrapped high.  \nHarvey only needs 1 dynamic step or two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach. There are perimeter \nruns where he can get downhill without a transition step and at a good rate of speed.  \nHarvey changes stride length and pace to set up defenders, blockers, and creases. He has good curvilinear speed.  \nAcceleration: Harvey has notable acceleration through the crease and beats box defenders. He’ll beat a high safety \nchasing him to the far-side flat.  \nSpeed: Harvey has the speed to beat a linebacker to the far sideline. He can break away up the boundary and extend leads \nagainst defensive backs.  \nPower: Harvey has some pop with his stiff-arm and this can force defensive backs to slide down his frame to attempt the \ntackle. When wrapped high, Harvey has a strong enough low center of gravity to drag a defensive lineman 2-3 yards \ndownhill. When wrapped low he can drag a defensive back 2-3 yards downhill.  \nHarvey drops his pads into glancing shots and this helps him get downhill. He’s a determined red zone runner who keeps his \nfeet moving.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Harvey can win direct collisions with safeties in the open field when he has a runway.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Harvey can bounce off hits to his side and pads from defensive backs. He can take hits in \nsuccession from safeties and maintain his balance. He can stalemate a linebacker in the crease when hit with a glancing \nshot and bounce off to access an open lane.  \nRoutes: Harvey identifies the highly safety when working up the seam in zone. He turns his head to the quarterback once \nhe passes the buzz defender. He identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He \npresents a good target.  \nHarvey has a quick double-up to the inside to set up an out-breaking route against coverage playing over the top.  \nReceiving: Harvey can make a back-shoulder catch up the seam with coverage bearing down at the target point. He \nattacks with overhand position away from his frame. He can take a wrap at his back as he makes the catch and turns \ndownhill.  \nHarvey can extend his arms away from his frame and track the ball over his shoulder with underhand position on a wide \nroute. Harvey displays good judgement with the appropriate attack.  \nHe attacks the ball at the earliest window possible and he’ll work back to the ball out of his break or during a scramble drill.  \nWhere Harvey has lapses is with focus drops—turning his head downfield before securing the ball. He also has lapses where \nhe leaps unnecessarily for targets above his head when in the middle of the field facing the quarterback.  \nBlocking: Harvey can square a linebacker in the pocket and shield the A-Gap pressure. He extends his hands first toward \nthe defender but gets beaten to the punch. He moves his feet after contact, but getting beaten to the punch often forces \nhim off-balance. \n\n \n167 \nDefenders also work around Harvey because he doesn’t close the gap enough. He’s too often a one-and-done collider who \ngives up redirects too fast.  \nHarvey must learn to close the gap and use the uppercut. He’s more of a shield blocker against linebackers and safeties. \nWhen in a lot of traffic and assigned to one of multiple rushers working the middle of the pocket, Harvey will throw his \npunch with abandon because he can knock a defender into a teammate.  \nHarvey will stand up to a defensive end but the larger man’s punch will knock Harvey backward as will a linebacker. He can \nanchor against safety blitzes that have momentum downhill even when beaten to the punch. He’ll move his feet to remain \nsquare with the defensive back in these situations.  \nHarvey will slide inside-out across the formation and deliver a shoulder and/or forearm into a linebacker off the edge.  \nHe’ll slide inside to help a tackle with an edge defender taking an inside path to the pocket. He’ll shield the defender with his \nposition. He delivers chips using his forearm or pads as he leaks to the flat. \nHarvey can be late to pick up A-Gap pressure that’s looping to the opposite A-Gap than the defender’s pre-snap alignment. \nHe can be reticent to square this pressure and his poor position allows blitzers through. He diagnoses T-E twists and can \nearn a good angle to strike the chest of the tackle working around end.  \nHarvey reads pre-snap pressure but can be late with cut blocks and miss the blitzer entirely.  \nHarvey is a good lead blocker who can dig out a middle linebacker in the flat with close contact into the chest and pads and \ndeliver hard strike to the inside shoulder.  \nBall Security: 651 career touches in 4 years with 9 fumbles—1 per 72.33. Harvey carries the ball with his elbow wide of his \nside. He is prone to swinging the ball away from his chest and carrying the ball under his right arm even when working \noutside the left hash and with pursuit from the inside.  \nWhen in heavy traffic and anticipating contact, Harvey will carry high and tight and takes contact to the ball without a \nproblem.  \nDurability: Season-ending knee injury (ACL tear) in August 2021.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If Harvey curtails the fumbling and improves his decision-making, he could become a \nviable flex-play in leagues that start 4-5 running backs, especially in PPR formats. For now, Harvey is a late-round roster \nstash until we see the NFL’s referendum on his draft capital.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBack-shoulder vs coverage bearing down, good attack \n• \nHip mobility, curvilinear movement, problem-solving, acceleration \n• \nGood pass-pro rep to build on \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n168 \nRB Raheim “Rocket” Sanders RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: RB36 \nJersey: No. 5 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/217 School: Arkansas \nComparison Spectrum: DeMarco Murray - James Starks-Roschon Johnson/X - Patrick Taylor \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 75.3 = Contributor: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \nSanders is on the cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nMississippi ‘22 \n• \nAlabama ‘22 \n• \nLSU ‘24 \n• \nAlabama ‘24 \n• \nClemson ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A well-built back, Sanders is a competent decision-maker with strong top-end speed and good hands \nin the passing game. He lacks short-area explosion. Despite having good footwork, that lack of suddenness may hurt limit \nhim to a situational role.  \nSanders is a downfield bully who also gives defenses problems when he can get a long runway on a perimeter run. This \nmakes Sanders a good candidate for a gap scheme as well as inside zone.  \nWe think of space players as quick-sudden movers, but they can also be long-developing accelerators with excellent size \nand strength. Sanders is a reliable receiver and has shown that he can deliver big plays as a schemed option in the flats on \nscreen passes.  \nAsking Sanders to extricate himself with a lot of stop-start footwork is a bad idea. He’s often a beat late with his footwork in \nthese situations because it takes him time to build speed. Offenses can’t rely on Sanders to pick his way through heavy \ntraffic reliable with stop-start movement, but if he can get a runway and make one cut, he’s trouble for defenders.  \nSanders should make a roster. He has the potential to work his way into a situational role where he can approximate what \nwe’ve seen from Gus Edwards, but in a smaller package. It’s more likely that we’ll see Sanders as a reserve who can fill in \nfor a starter as part of a committee. He’ll generate big plays, but it’s unlikely Sanders will be the lead back who can foil \ndefenses focused on limiting him.  \nThat’s probably a long way of saying that his future looks like Roschon Johnson’s in Chicago. Sanders could develop into \nlarger part of a committee, if not a co-starter if he learns to hang onto the ball. His ball security rate is on the cusp of being \nunacceptable for an NFL player. If Sanders limits his fumbles, he could be a viable role player with weekly statistical value. \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Although he runs a lot of inside zone, his skill for efficient transitions makes him a \npotentially strong wide-zone and/or gap scheme option. \nVision: Sanders spots interior and edge penetration as he takes the exchange but he’s either processing it a beat late or \nexecuting his turn a beat late due to a lack of efficiency of movement with opening his hips.  \nWhen running inside zone, Sanders anticipates the set-up of the double team. He will press a linebacker in the opposite \ndirection of the track he eventually takes—widening that desired rushing lane.  \nSanders presses within 1-2 steps of the line. He identifies bounces and cutback opportunities, accessing them quickly after \nan initial press. He’ll also set up blocks in the open field to maximize rushing lanes for chunk gains.  \nSanders can set up blocks on Counter with good reads of defender leverage and work inside-out on the backside puller to \nearn an alley off the outside puller. He’s decisive tight crease runner when running gap plays between the tackles.  \nIn the open field, he’ll set up defenders pursuing from over the top with efficient movement. He’s mostly a straight-line \nrunner in this area of the field.  \nElusiveness: Sanders adjusts his stride to set up blocks or avoid penetration. He must improve the height of his steps \nwhen cutting his stride to set up and work around blocks when in the box and entering the crease. He’s prone to tripping \n\n \n169 \nover the feet of his blockers as he works around them. He also can’t get over shots to his feet from a safety over the top as \nhe’s turning the corner on a perimeter run. \nSanders is better with lifting his feet over shots when he’s working downhill and the shots come from a defender working \nacross the field.  \nSanders has a choppy stride that reminds me of the tip-toe gait of Herschel Walker, DeMarco Murray, and Keith Byars. \nSanders can point the toe to open his hips and bounce outside pursuit from defensive linemen. He has lapses where takes \nan unnecessary step between the exchange and the penetration but this may be a recognition or processing issue.  \nWhen the hip opener move is on time, Sanders has lapses where he leans on a wide-stride gait that can lack explosion out \nof the move because he doesn’t transfer his weight to the foot he should be cutting off.  \nSanders can make a quick stop with one step to transition from an approach to the far-side edge to a downhill track. \nSanders’ quick stops can force a defensive end or linebacker to overrun his angle of pursuit.  \nSanders also uses sticks to force defensive backs out of position in the open field. He’s skilled with delivering a stick toward \nthe nearest pursuit and then taking the stick-leg away from the defender with the help of some hip flip and high knees \nthrough each step after the stick. If he can keep his knees and feet high with other footwork between the tackles, he could \nbecome even more elusive.  \nSanders will spin away from downhill pursuit when wrapped and carrying the tackler on his back.  \nSanders has pressure cuts that can get him to the adjacent crease after pressing his blocker. He delivers a stiff arm \neffective in the open field, warding off the reach of a linebacker or safety and turning his pads to the boundary so he’s \ngetting skinny from the defender.  \nAlthough his feet are often good, he lacks juice with his short area movement.  \nAcceleration: Sanders has the acceleration to reach the far-side edge against box defenders.  \nSpeed: Sanders can hold off linebackers and defensive backs in the open field. Unless he gets a long track to fully open up \nhis stride, Sanders lacks the gear to consistently pull away from safeties as much as simply maintain whatever separation \nhe has when entering the secondary. He’ll do the same with a cornerback if he has room to veer to the opposite side of the \nfield during a run that takes him into the secondary.   \nPower: Sanders’ stiff-arm is strong enough to ward off multiple reach attempts from a defensive end in the backfield as \nhe’s bouncing outside the penetration of the defender. Sanders drops his pads into creases and keeps his feet moving, \nwhich helps him pull through wraps from defensive tackles wrapping him high.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Sanders can bounce off direct contact from a linebacker at the other end of a crease. He can also \ngenerate a push downfield through the collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Sanders can take a hit above the waist from a linebacker and maintain a downhill path without \nlosing balance immediately. He can also stalemate defensive end meeting him in the backfield.  \nRoutes: Sanders has a good double-up against tight man-to-man coverage and counters it with a swat. must develop snap \nwith the turn of his frame at the top of stems on out-breaking routes. He can also sell the outside with a stick and look at \nthe top of the stem to set up a break inside.  \nEven with the moves at the top of stems, Sanders lacks suddenness in and out of his breaks.  \nHe’ll identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and settle into the open area.  \nReceiving: Sanders uses overhand position away from his frame to catch targets on wide routes at shoulder height. He can \ncatch the ball behind his break path with his arms away from his frame and make the extension last-second. He’ll use \nunderhand position with targets low at the numbers or on the beltline.  \nSanders will post up a safety and extend his arms to the ball with the defender on his back. As he makes the catch, he’ll \nexecute a pull-back—torquing his frame away from the defender to protect the ball as he takes contact to his back during \nthe catch.  \n\n \n170 \nSanders is aware of the boundary and makes catches tight to the sideline. When he has a lapse as a receiver, he clap-traps \nwith underhand attack.  \nBlocking: Sanders recognizes edge pressure, slides to the open spot, and squares defenders as large as defensive ends. He \ntakes the air out of the position between himself and the defender, keeps his arms tight with his elbows bent, and punches \ninto the chest of the opponent.  \nSanders is effective at picking up twists. He slides outside-in with good lateral movement, sinks his hips, and delivers a \nstrike with tight hands and an uppercut motion.  \nSanders tips off cut blocks through interior gaps. He drops his head and leans into the oncoming defender rather than \nshoots forward late with his head up. He works across the frame of the defender but the lean and the head position leads to \nhim not seeing where he’s attacking and the attack is slow and lacks and force through the opponent.  \nBall Security: Sanders carries the ball high to his frame with his boundary-side arm. He can take contact of a defensive \nlineman raking across his ball-carrying arm while wrapping up the runner. Sanders tightens up the security with his elbow \nwhen aware of traffic, but the elbow is often loose when running in the open field.  \nSanders has 9 fumbles in 658 career touches – 1 per 73.1 touches. He had 3 in 210 touches in 2024. \nDurability: Sanders was limited in two games in 2024 with an ankle injury. He torn his labrum in 2023 and missed the final \ngames of the season. He had surgery on his shoulder during the 2024 offseason and missed the spring season.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Sanders from afar unless in a deep format with over 40 roster spots and you’re \nstockpiling backs for your practice squad.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nCutback on Duo, hip mobility, stiff arm, feet high \n• \nRocket is an apt nickname \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2022 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n171",
        "analysis": "**RJ Harvey**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Dynamic, elusive runner with excellent hip mobility and footwork in tight spaces.  Good cutback runner in zone schemes (Zone, Draw, Duo). Skilled receiver who adjusts well to the ball, though prone to focus drops. Possesses surprising contact balance for his size.\n* **Opportunities:**  If he improves ball security and decision-making (particularly avoiding unnecessary cutbacks on Gap plays), he could become a valuable rotational back or even a weekly contributor in the right system.  His receiving skills add versatility.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Tarik Cohen, Ito Smith.  He shares Cohen's elusiveness and receiving ability, but lacks Cohen's explosive acceleration.  Smith provides a comparison in terms of size and skillset, highlighting his potential as a change-of-pace back.\n\n**Raheim \"Rocket\" Sanders**\n\n* **Strengths:** Well-built with good top-end speed and reliable hands in the passing game.  Effective downhill runner, particularly in gap schemes and inside zone.  Can make big plays with a long runway.  Good blocker.\n* **Opportunities:**  Could carve out a situational role similar to Gus Edwards (though smaller).  If he improves ball security, he could develop into a larger part of a committee backfield or even a co-starter. His ability as a receiver makes him a more valuable all-around player.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** DeMarco Murray, James Starks, Roschon Johnson, Patrick Taylor.  Murray and Starks offer comparisons in their ability to break big runs, while Johnson and Taylor represent potential role models for Sanders' likely path as a committee back or situational runner.  His straight-line speed is similar to Murray's, but he lacks Murray's overall elusiveness.\n\n**Key Difference:** Harvey is a shifty, elusive back who excels in short-area quickness, while Sanders is a more powerful, straight-line runner with good speed who needs space to accelerate. Both players have ball security issues that need to be addressed to reach their full potential.\n"

Yeldon - - X  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 74.4 = Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. Sanders is on the cusp of \nthe Contributor Tier: Starter execution in a limited role; diminishing returns beyond that scope. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nAuburn ‘21 \n• \nCincinnati ‘21 \n• \nColorado ‘23 \n• \nHouston ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A former top recruit at his position when arriving at Alabama, Sanders suffered serious injuries during \nhis career with the Crimson Tide – breaking his foot and then getting into a car accident that broke his pelvis. Sanders \nworked his way back from being wheelchair bound but wound up at TCU and didn’t see a lot of playing time in 2024. \nQuestions remain about his physical skills post-accident. \nVision: Sanders understands how to set up Counter and displays patience with his lead blocker. He finds the viable cutback \non Power.  \nSanders will press zone runs inside within a step of his blocker’s feet and bounce outside to the open lane. In 2021, Sanders \nwould bounce a run outside from deep in his own end zone when the wiser course was to take on the linebacker entering \nthe designed lane. He’d wind up bouncing into the leverage advantage of the defense rather than welcoming the one-on-\none with a downhill approach that would have lower risk with at least a slightly bigger reward.  \nIf the penetration is already in the backfield and it precludes a bounce or cutback, he’ll attack downhill and take on the \ndefender in the hole coming off a block. \nSanders presses toward the unblocked linebacker’s leverage advantage behind a double team on Duo and when he’s within \na step of his blocks, cut back to the other side.  \nElusiveness: Sanders adjusts his stride length to set up blocks against penetration behind the line of scrimmage. He times \nhurdles of cornerbacks shooting for his knees or lower legs. Sanders has the mobility to bend downhill from an outside \napproach while inside the tackle box and do it at a good pace.   \nSanders has the change of direction quickness to make a penetrating edge defender miss with a pressure cut to the inside. \nHe flips his hips quickly out of the cut so his shoulders are immediately downhill.  \nHe only needs two steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill approach at the edge of the tackle box.  \nSanders can set up a safety or linebacker in the hole with a stick and juke to slide inside or outside the pursuit. He displays \nawareness with getting his feet up when wrapped low, but he has to react a step sooner to break the tackle.  \nHe gets his feet up over shots to his lower legs.  \nAcceleration: Sanders has enough burst to beat a high safety to the narrow side edge on an off-tackle zone play.  \nSpeed: Sanders had competent speed – beating box defenders into the secondary.  \nPower: Sanders will keep his legs moving through contact and runs through reaches from linebackers. He can pull through \nreaches from all three levels of the defense and do it on the same play in the box. He could be more active with his stiff-\narm, but he will use it to ward off defenders shooting for his hips and thighs.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Sanders can initiate contact with a defensive tackle and at least stalemate the opponent. He will \nalso run through the initial contact and force the defender to wrap as Sanders generates a positive lean or 1-3 steps \ndownhill after the contact. He can stalemate and/or work past a linebacker after a direct collision in the hole.  \n\n \n172 \nIndirect Contact Balance Sanders will bounce off hard indirect contact from a linebacker in the hole to one side of his \nchest. He has a capable balance-touch to maintain his feet after pulling through a wrap to his lower legs.  \nRoutes: Sanders runs wide routes, swing routes, leaks to the middle of the field from the backfield. When detached from \nthe formation, he runs stop routes with a snap to the turn.  \nWhether he’s working against zone or man-to-man Sanders will work with the quarterback during a scramble drill.  \nHe drifts out of speed breaks on out-breaking routes.  \nReceiving: Watch Sanders’ hand position with targets at the numbers. He might be prone to using a mixed position with \none overhand and one underhand and close to his chest. He did this with both targets in the 2021 Auburn game – a throw-\nout and a swing pass.  \nSanders will use overhand position with uniform hands with targets just above the numbers on wide routes.  \nAfter the catch, Sanders will attack downhill, splitting defenders to earn positive yardage.  \nBlocking: Sanders picks up A-gap blitzes from linebackers and safeties. He will slide into the crease with enough depth to \nsquare the opponent and deliver both hands into the hips or belly and move his feet to slide the defender outside the \npocket.  \nSanders leans into the contact, dipping his head. This limits the potential to throw a punch. However, if he earns contact \nwith his hands into the frame of the opponent, he’ll roll his hips through the contact to force the defender off his feet.  \nSanders picks up twisting defenders working inside and can work his hands into the chest of the opponent while maintaining \na square position.  \nSanders can miss linebackers aligned outside the end that through the interior gaps inside.   \nBall Security: Sanders carries the ball high and tight between the tackles under his boundary-side arm when outside the \ntackle box and under his right arm as his arm of preference with other attempts. He’ll take contact to the ball.  \nDurability: Sanders missed most of his freshman year with a broken foot and took a medical redshirt. He fractured his \npelvis and was wheelchair-bound in 2020 after a serious car accident. He returned 10 months later to the field.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Sanders from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2022 Highlights \n• \nHighlights vs. Tennessee (2021) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n173",
        "analysis": "Trey Sanders is a running back prospect with a high ceiling hampered by significant injury history.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision:** Shows patience, understands blocking schemes (Counter, Power, Duo), and identifies cutback lanes effectively.  He's adept at pressing the line and bouncing outside when necessary.\n* **Elusiveness:**  Possesses good change of direction quickness, able to make defenders miss with cuts and jukes.  He adjusts stride length to set up blocks and effectively hurdles low tackles.\n* **Power:** Runs through contact, consistently pulls through arm tackles from all levels of the defense.  While his stiff arm could be improved, he uses it effectively to ward off tackles to the hips and thighs.\n* **Balance:**  Maintains balance through both direct and indirect contact, able to stalemate or work past tackles.\n* **Receiving:**  Shows ability to run various routes and secure the ball in the passing game, though hand position can be inconsistent.  He is effective after the catch.\n* **Blocking:**  Competent in pass protection, picking up blitzes from various positions, although technique could be improved.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved consistency:** While showing flashes of excellent ability, his decision-making and execution aren't always consistent.  His hand placement when catching the ball is an example.\n* **Health:**  His significant injury history (broken foot, fractured pelvis) is the biggest question mark. His durability needs to be proven at the NFL level.  \n* **Increased playing time:** His limited playing time at TCU raises concerns about his readiness for the NFL.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** T.J. Yeldon is the provided comparison, suggesting a similar running style.  However, Yeldon had significantly more consistent playing time and production at the college level.  A more apt comparison might depend on his post-draft development and the specific role he fills within an NFL team.  His injury history makes direct comparisons difficult.  He might project as a player who is a good situational back, able to contribute in short-yardage and receiving situations. However, a full-time role might be dependent upon overcoming his injury concerns.\n"

He arrived in South Carolina ranked by 247 Sports as \nthe 18th-ranked RB in his class.  \nInjuries got the best of Mellusi during his career, but he has moments where he showed impressive skills in crowded \nbackfields. Mellusi is an intriguing back with a good combination of decision-making, quickness, and functional power who \nnever got to fully develop due to injuries. \nVision: Mellusi can be a beat late to identifying interior penetration to avoid it. He’s quicker to identify penetration off the \nedge. He’ll avoid interior penetration but for the NFL game, he has to work on changing direction as he takes the exchange \nrather than 1-2 steps after the exchange.  \nHe’ll press creases within 1-2 steps to set up cutbacks. He’ll also press defenders to set up lead blocks on gap and ISO \nplays.  \nMellusi finds cutbacks on Counter when the front side isn’t well blocked. He’ll squeeze through tight creases in the gap \ngame. He can avoid penetration and stay skinny downhill.  \nElusiveness: Mellusi can open his hips with the point of a toe. He can also drop his weight into a quick stop.  \nHe’ll try to spin away from contact in the open field.  \nHe has the speed and control to transition downhill from a perimeter approach with one step or two quick steps. Even with \nmultiple injuries, Mellusi’s footwork with transitions is smooth and controlled.  \nHe has an effective juke outside-in to set up edge defenders and work back to the inside. He can beat safeties playing over \nthe top of him.  \nWhen approaching tight creases, he’ll cut his stride length to give his blockers time to reach assignments.  \nAcceleration: Mellusi has the acceleration to get outside the box quickly and get downhill past box defenders and into the \nsecondary. He can do this to the short or far side of the field.  \nSpeed: Mellusi has reserve-caliber speed. He’ll beat some linebackers with decent pursuit angles on him.  \nPower: Mellusi runs with a good lean with his pads over his knees. He can get under contact in a tight crease and extend \nforward for yardage. He’ll split defensive tackles and linebackers to take what he can get.  \nMellusi can drop his head and instead of getting his pads into the defender, he falls into the legs of the defender at the end \nof the crease rather than run through them. When he keeps his head up, Mellusi can push linebackers 2-3 steps downfield \nwith his low pads and leg drive.  \nHe has an effective stiff-arm to ward off reaches from defensive linemen and keeps his feet moving through contact in tight \ncreases. He’ll pull through high wraps from large defensive tackles and drag them downhill when he can hit a hole at a good \npace.  \n\n \n174 \nDirect Contact Balance: Mellusi can bounce off head-on contact from a linebacker in the crease.   \nIndirect Contact Balance: Mellusi will stalemate linebackers at the entrance of the crease. He could win some of these \ncollisions by making them direct collision by keeping his pads square into contact and accelerating into it.  \nHowever, Mellusi can also take hard contact from a linebacker to his torso and continue forward into the crease with at least \n1-3 steps.  \nHe’ll stalemate a linebacker and defensive end when splitting them in a short-yardage situation, keeping his feet long \nenough that his teammates can help generate a push.  \nMellusi will also knock a defensive tackle or end backward with a stiff-arm if the tackle is off-balance or flat-footed when \nmeeting Mellusi at the entrance of the crease. He spins off glancing shots from defensive backs in the open field.  \nRoutes: Mellusi has a hip shift to work against man coverage on a vertical route, but he has to emphasize the movements \nto sell it better. He can counter the defender’s hands with a wipe.  \nReceiving: Mellusi will attack the ball at helmet level with arms away from their frame and using overhand position. He \nalso uses underhand attack for targets near the beltline. He has lapses with clapping onto targets.  \nMellusi is quick to react to targets above his pads and behind his break path and extend for them with his feet on the \nground.  \nBlocking: Mellusi identifies B-Gap pressure. He overextends to the point that he’s leading with his head far over his frame \ninto contact and it caps his potential to sustain a block, even against lighter defenders like safeties. When he punches and \nthe overextension isn’t too far, Mellusi will deliver an uppercut but his hands aren’t tight enough to reach the chest of the \ndefender.  \nMellusi identifies T-E twists. He must slide to the tackle earlier to deliver a chip.  \nBall Security: Mellusi carries the ball close to his chest and under the boundary-side arm. His elbow is wide from his frame \nas he runs.  \nMellusi has 4 fumbles on 486 touches between 2019-2024 – 1 per 121.5 touches.  \nDurability: Torn left ACL in early November 2021, fractured fibula in September of 2023. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Mellusi from afar \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMobility \n• \nMobility II \n• \nChez Mellusi 2022 Highlights \n• \nChez Mellusi 2021 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n175",
        "analysis": "Chez Mellusi is an intriguing but injury-prone running back prospect.  His strengths lie in his vision, elusiveness, and functional power. He shows good instincts in finding cutback lanes and navigating tight creases, possessing smooth footwork and the ability to accelerate quickly in either direction.  He's also shown the ability to run through contact, using a low center of gravity and effective stiff arm. While his top-end speed is merely average (reserve-caliber), his acceleration allows him to quickly get to the second level.  His receiving skills are decent, though inconsistent. He needs improvement in pass protection, often overextending and leading with his head.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  Mellusi’s potential is hampered by a significant injury history (torn ACL, fractured fibula). If he can remain healthy, his combination of skills could make him a valuable contributor.  His film shows flashes of excellence; consistent performance and improved pass blocking are key to maximizing his NFL potential.\n\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**  Mellusi's injury history is his biggest obstacle.  He needs to improve his vision reading interior penetration, decision-making at the exchange, and pass blocking technique.  While his ball security isn't terrible (1 fumble per 121.5 touches), it's an area to monitor.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The comparison spectrum provided (Bilal Powell, Devin Neal, Ke'Shawn Vaughn) accurately reflects his profile.  He's a potential role player like Powell, possessing some of Neal’s elusiveness but lacking Neal's high-end explosiveness. He also shares similarities with Vaughn in their physicality and ability to run between the tackles but lacks Vaughn’s breakaway speed.  The comparisons suggest a player who might find a niche as a change-of-pace back or special teams contributor rather than a bell-cow.  Overall, he's a high-risk, high-reward prospect whose ultimate success depends heavily on staying healthy.\n"

Michigan ‘24 \n• \nWVU ‘2021  \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Thomas earned MVP of Guaranteed Rate Bowl in 2021 at Minnesota while working in a committee with \nBucky Irving, Thomas is a decisive inside runner with has facility with inside zone and gap plays.  \nThomas moves well in traffic and in the open field. He’s both efficient and dynamic with his footwork, and he’s a powerful \nrunner who can work through multiple points of contact.  \nThomas’s speed is competent, but not top end. He has positive moments as a pass protector, but he overextends too often \nand this can hurt him.  \nIf Thomas can get more explosive and improve his blocking, he could make an active roster as a reserve who could \ncontribute.  \nVision: Thomas is decisive into the open crease on inside zone runs. When he faces penetration between the tackles, \nThomas can slide outside laterally from the downhill penetrator.  \nHe reads leverage effectively on perimeter runs, knowing when to cut downhill. With Duo, Thomas will take what’s in front \nof him and push through contact in tight creases to maximize what’s available.  \nHe works ahead of down blocks and sets up pullers on Power. If there’s an obvious cutback, Thomas will take it. With zone \nplays, Thomas will work within 1-2 steps of the line or unblocked defender before making a bounce or cutback.  \nElusiveness: Thomas spins off hard glancing shots. He has sharp enough pressure cuts to work away from penetration off \nthe edge and up the middle.  \nBetween the tackles, Thomas can transition east-west to north-south with two quick steps to cut inside the penetrating \nlinebacker shooting a gap. He only needs two quick steps to transition at the edge of the tackle box.  \nHe’ll also use an efficient jump cut or jump stop to avoid pursuit in traffic. He adjusts his stride length and pace. He also \nlayers moves in succession to work past multiple points of pursuit – jump cuts, spins, and sticks.  \nThomas can open his hips with the point of his toe to the boundary and bounce from penetration.  \nAcceleration: Thomas has enough downhill acceleration to beat box defenders and box safeties through a crease into the \nsecond level. He beats box defenders to the far side and near side edges on perimeter runs and bounce-outs.  \nSpeed: Thomas lacks top-end speed in the open field, but he can hold off safeties and cornerbacks for 25-40 yards.  \nPower: Thomas has the lower-body strength to keep his feet when multiple box defenders wrap him high. He runs through \nlower-body wraps from defensive backs at the second level. He kicks his feet up and gets his knees high to work through \nreaches to his legs from box defenders.  \nThomas pulls through multiple reaches from box defenders and safeties in the crease and at the second level. When \nwrapped high, he keeps his feet moving.  \nThomas uses a stiff-arm to chop away the reach of a defender. He has an active stiff-arm as a runner. In the open field, \nThomas attacks defenders as a finisher.  \n\n \n176 \nDirect Contact Balance: Thomas bounces off direct shots from cornerbacks when he has momentum built up on the \nperimeter or downhill. He wins collisions with linebackers in the hole when he has momentum and forces the defender to \nwrap and drag Thomas to the ground.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Thomas can bounce off hard contact to his pads from a defensive end hitting him in the \nbackfield as he finishes the exchange with the quarterback. Thomas has a capable balance touch to maintain his movement \ndownhill.  \nRoutes: Thomas identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area while making a \nfriendly target.  \nReceiving: Thomas tracks targets over his shoulder with his hands away from his frame. He can track the ball into one \nhand on wide routes over his shoulder. He tends to clap-attack with underhand position.  \nThomas uses overhand position for targets at the numbers or helmet-height. He transitions downhill with catch and pierce \nprinciples. He gauges the pursuit of defenders and obeys the target to make a catch and pierce away from the defenders.  \nBlocking: Thomas earns a squat position. When he chips, he throws his body into the defender and strikes with violence. \nHe follows through with his frame to rock a box defender.  \nThomas squares defensive ends on double teams. He approaches with his hands tight so he can get into the chest of the \ndefender. He doesn’t deliver a forceful strike with the uppercut. Instead, he buries his face and hands into the chest of \nlinebackers and edge defenders.  \nHe overextends, but isn’t throwing or leaning off-balance at the point of attack. His feet are wide and balanced.  \nThomas also squares edge pressure and slides with good lateral movement to remain square as edge pressure works \ntoward the pocket.  \nWhen setting up to block an edge defender, he’ll peel back inside when that edge defender takes an inside path on the \ntackle. He then delivers a shot to the chest of the defender to seal him inside as the quarterback flushes the pocket.  \nThomas identifies A-gap pressure and cross-blitzing linebackers. He will deliver his hands with some roll of the hips but the \nuppercut isn’t strong and the roll isn’t pronounced because he’s leaning into the strike. He’s prone to catching contact from \nlinebackers.  \nThomas was better with his punches as a freshman at Minnesota than he has at Kent State.  \nBall Security: Thomas tucks targets into his left arm when working to the left flat/boundary. He keeps the ball high to his \nchest, but the elbow is loose from his side more often than to he should to earn the grade. He’s better at keeping it tight in \ntraffic. Thomas has a habit of carrying the ball under his right arm regardless of the direction of the play design. He can use \neither arm but leans toward only using his left side.  \nThomas can take some contact to the ball, but it will slip down his frame and he fights it a bit.  \nHe has 347 career touches with three teams and 5 fumbles – 1 per 69.4—3 of those fumbles came in 117 touches this year.  \nDurability: Missed 2023 because he sat out to transfer from Kansas.

        "analysis": "Ky Thomas is a decisive, powerful inside runner with good vision and elusiveness, but lacks top-end speed and needs improvement in pass protection.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision & Decisiveness:** Excellent at reading creases and making quick, decisive cuts, particularly on inside zone runs.  He effectively utilizes leverage and identifies cutback lanes.\n* **Power & Balance:** Possesses impressive lower-body strength, enabling him to run through contact and maintain balance despite multiple tackles.  Effective at pushing through tackles and maintaining forward momentum.\n* **Elusiveness:**  Uses a variety of moves (spins, jump cuts) to evade tacklers, showing agility in tight spaces.  Effectively transitions from east-west to north-south running styles.\n* **Receiving:** Shows some ability as a receiver, capable of tracking the ball over his shoulder and making catches in traffic.\n* **Blocking (Potential):** Shows potential as a blocker, particularly in chip blocks and double teams, but needs refinement in technique and consistency.  Shows some effort in pass protection but often overextends.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Pass Protection:**  Overextension significantly hinders his pass-blocking effectiveness.  Refining technique is crucial for NFL viability.\n* **Increase Explosiveness:** While powerful, his lack of top-end speed limits his big-play potential.  Improving acceleration would enhance his overall game.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumble rate isn't alarmingly high, reducing the instances of the ball slipping down his frame is important. Improving consistent ball carrying technique would significantly boost confidence in his ability.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Top-End Speed:** Limits breakaway potential.\n* **Pass Protection Consistency:** Prone to overextension, resulting in penalties and missed blocks.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report offers a range of comparisons, highlighting the mixed bag of his skillset:\n\n* **Bilal Powell:**  Similar in size and style as a patient, powerful runner who can catch passes. However, Powell had a more consistent and refined skillset than Thomas currently displays.\n* **Devin Neal:**  Shares the compact build and ability to run between the tackles.  Neal's explosiveness and overall skill set are probably slightly above Thomas's.\n* **Ke'Shawn Vaughn:**  Similar in size and physicality, but Vaughn’s receiving skills are probably slightly better.\n* **Chez Mellusi:**  A similar profile in terms of size, and running style; both players are more suited to an early down, power running role, but aren't necessarily game breakers.\n\nOverall, Thomas projects as a potential reserve running back with limitations.  Improvement in pass protection and explosiveness is key to increasing his chances of making an NFL roster and seeing significant playing time.  He's likely a late-round pick or undrafted free agent.\n"

Carroll reads the defense well, and he’s skilled with pressing blocks as a zone \nrunner. Gap schemes on perimeter plays are trickier for him.  \nCarroll has efficient footwork and competent hands. If he can improve his burst, he might make the back end of a roster.  \nVision: Carroll reads the leverage of defenders on double-teams at the line of scrimmage and also accounts for penetration \ninto the backfield. He’ll press the double team within step of his blocks and find the bounce lane.  \nWhen Carroll has a clear hole, he’ll press the tackle, end, or linebacker away from the crease and cutback into the opening. \nWhen Carroll lacks a clear hole in the red zone, he takes what the design gives him rather than taking chances that can lead \nto losses.  \nCarroll can time his cuts too soon against linebackers and work across their face too early. He should press further downhill \nso he can get the most from the cutback.  \nWhen working behind two pullers on a sweep, he can improve his identification of opportunities to leverage the first puller’s \nefforts. Carroll presses interior creases to set up perimeter runs.  \nCarroll identifies interior penetration reaching the backfield during the exchange. He can point the toe downhill during a \nread to one side and get inside the penetrator and downhill.  \nElusiveness: Carroll must develop more efficient maneuvers to setup and execute the cutback opportunities he sees \nunfolding with double teams and penetration into the backfield. He doesn’t adjust his stride effectively and his moves \nappear better suited for open-field running rather than running in close quarters.  \nCarroll has sharp pressure cuts. He also has a tight spin off direct contact. He gets his feet over fallen defenders and low \nreaches in the crease. He’ll execute efficient jump cuts in tight creases that are appropriate to the play development.  \nIn the open field, Carroll can layer a stick and head fake to juke a safety pursuing over the top. He has an effective double-\nup inside pursuit to set up a pressure cut to bounce outside.  \nCarroll only needs 1-2 transition steps to get downhill at the edge of the tackle box. Carroll adjusts his stride length to avoid \npenetration into the backfield.  \nAcceleration: Carroll has the acceleration to beat some unblocked linebackers to the far-side edge.  \nSpeed: Carroll has the long speed to separation from safeties over the top of him in the secondary and maintain separation \nagainst them long enough to flip the field 40-60 yards.  \n\n \n178 \nPower: Carroll drops his pads and initiates contact with defenders in the crease. He’ll keep his feet moving through high \nwraps and leans forward as he’s wrapped at the legs. He keeps his feet well enough for teammates to rally to him and \ngenerate a push.  \nCarroll has a stiff-arm that wards off reaches from defensive backs in the open field. He also has a good close-quarters stiff \narm to push through high wraps to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Carroll wins direct shots against safeties hitting him on the other side of the crease. He has a \ntight spin that works off those shots. The same is true with smaller linebackers who hit first before wrapping. He stalemates \nlarger linebacker/lankier defensive ends in the hole.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Carroll drops his pads as he enters the crease and bounces off glancing shots from linebackers. \nHe forces linebackers to slide down Carroll’s frame and wrap up. Carroll can also bounce off defensive ends when he \ninitiates the contact and the defender is getting pushed away from the runner.  \nRoutes: Carroll identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open zone. He creates a friendly \ntarget. When his first break doesn’t earn him a target, he’ll work with his quarterback on the scramble drill into an open \nzone. When split wide of the formation, Carroll employs patient-but-sudden footwork to set up his stick against off-man \ncoverage.  \nReceiving: Carroll attacks the football with overhand position at helmet height and takes hard contact to his back as he \nsecures the target. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily when targets are at helmet level.  \nCarroll catches the ball with the hand position appropriate to the trajectory of the target. He’ll attack the ball at the earliest \nwindow of the target with overhand position when his back is to the quarterback.  \nCarrol transitions well downfield when he catches the ball with his back to the defender. He executes good catch-and-pierce \ntechnique and obeys the direction of the ball.  \nBlocking: Carroll earns a squat and square position against potential edge pressure. He identifies slot DB blitzes and \npositions himself to the defender’s inside shoulder, so he can push the defender outside the pocket.  \nCarroll identifies DE twists inside and plugs the passing late with a shoulder or back to wall off the defender, forcing the \ndefender to a bigger teammate. Unfortunately, he does the same with DTs in scenarios where turning his back into the \nopponent won’t result in a sustained effort. When Carroll squares a twisting DT and delivers his hands, he delivers tight \nenough to rock the defender in the chest and has success with sustaining the effort. He must do this as his default effort \nrather than turning his back to the defender.  \nHe shuffles his feet well against edge pressure to remain square. He will take the inside man when presented with and \noutside-inside pressure dilemma. He delivers his hands with his elbows tight and aims for the defender’s breastplate.  \nAlthough Carroll delivers his hands, he doesn’t deliver hard strikes. He catches contact more often than he delivers it. His \nhands function more as a brace for contact than an engine to deliver it.  \nCarroll can be better at chip-releases. He can miss opportunities to get contact on a defender and slow their path to the \nquarterback so he earns a better target in the screen game.  \nCarroll has an effective cut block. He’ll work through contact with good height and shoot through the defender.  \nBall Security: Carroll carries the ball high to his frame. His elbow is loose from his side. He uses his boundary-side arm \nwhen working to that side of the field on a designed play. He can take contact to the ball. Carroll has 544 career touches \nand 6 fumbles – 1 per 90.67 touches.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Carroll from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMarcus Carroll Jump Cut Duo \n• \nMarcus Carroll Pass Pro Twist \n• \n2023 Highlights \n\n \n179 \nRB Nay’Quan Wright RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: RB41 \nJersey: No.5 / No.6 \nHeight/Weight: 5’9”/204 School: USF/Florida \nComparison Spectrum: Jeff Wilson-Jake Funk - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 70.5 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. Wright is on \nthe cusp of the Reserve Tier: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nAlabama ‘23 \n• \nAlabama ‘21 \n• \nVanderbilt ‘21 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Wright is a capable cutback runner with reserve-level explosion who needs to work on his receiving \ngame, Wright is a good route runner for the position, but his attacks are lackluster as a pass-catcher. Wright has pedestrian \nspeed and acceleration, but sudden stop-start movement with a variety of good maneuvers.  \nWright will be fighting for a practice squad spot unless he can prove worthwhile on special teams.  \nVision: Wright spots cutback opportunities on Counter. He attacks tight creases on Power and Inside Zone. He reads the \nleverage of defenders and understands when to work a play off-tackle back to the inside. Wright presses within a step of \ndefenders and blockers to earn space. He’s not shy about squeezing between a defender’s shoulder and a blocker to access \ndownhill yardage.  \nIn the open field, Wright has excellent feel for spotting and executing cuts across the grain of pursuit. With zone read, \nWright identifies the edge and/or interior penetration and works away from it during the exchange.  \nElusiveness: Wright has sudden stop-start movement. He gets excellent weight drop into jump stops and accelerates well \nout of the move. Wright adjusts his stride length and/or pace to set up defenders coming downhill in pursuit and this \nfreezes them as he works around them.  \nHe’ll use a double-up behind the line of scrimmage to set up creases and change his pace and stride.  \nWright can open his hips with economy to flip them 90 degrees and set up bounces/cutbacks. Wright’s curvilinear bend and \nspeed is notable and helps him avoid good pursuit angles in the open field.  \nWright is skilled at ducking under contact in the crease and in the open field. He needs 2-3 steps to transition downhill, \ndepending on the side of the field he’s traveling.  \nAcceleration: Wright has enough acceleration from stop-start moves to beat linebackers and some safeties in the first, \nsecond, and third level depending on when he makes the move. An Alabama DT beat him to the opposite boundary on a \ntoss play and tackled him, limiting him to a gain of three yards.  \nSpeed: Cornerbacks on the same side of the field can run down Wright after a gain of 15-20 yards from the point of the \ndefender’s pursuit.  \nPower: Wright anticipates reaches to his frame and slaps them away with his stiff arm. He pulls through light reaches to his \nupper body from linebackers shooting gaps into the backfield.  \nWhen running between the tackles, Wright drops his pads into oncoming contact and keeps his feet moving through the \ncollision. He initiates the contact.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Wright will drop his pads into an oncoming safety at the exit of a crease and run over the \ndefender in a direct collision.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Wright will drop his pads and bounce off glancing shots from defensive backs in the open \nfield—safeties and cornerbacks. \n\n \n180 \nRoutes: When working vertical routes, he doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until he clears the buzz/rollover \ndefender. Wright tempos his breaks when working across zones.  \nWright has a double-up to set up the slant as a detached receiver. There is pacing variation with the move although there \ncan be a great contrast between patient but sudden. \nWhen matched in the slot, Wright employs a stick to set up a defender on a two-way-go. He counters the defender’s hands \nwith a wipe-shed combination.  \nWright can drop his weight and flip his hips to generate separation against man coverage. He creates a friendly target to his \nquarterback.   \nReceiving: Wright allows targets into his frame that he should catch with his arms away from his frame. He also lapses into \nmixed hands position with his attacks.  \nWright can track the ball over his shoulder on wide routes, and he’ll use overhand position to secure the target. He also \nuses tight overhand position with targets above his head on slants and pulls the ball back and torques his frame so the \ncoverage downhill of him can’t reach for the ball as he secures the target.  \nBlocking: Wright identifies C-Gap pressure from linebackers and squares his assignment. He gets impatient with when to \ndeliver a collision and overextends with his frame. He must develop an uppercut so he’s not throwing his forearms into the \ndefender while off-balance. This can limit his effectiveness against redirects/second efforts.  \nAfter the initial contact, Wright moves his feet well laterally to remain square to the opponent. He at least shields larger \ndefenders, walling them off.  \nWright catches contact with chips. He must be the aggressor. This is something he did a better job of at USF in 2023 vs. his \ntime at UF in 2021.  \nWright can peel off a primary assignment to take on a secondary assignment looping inside-out to the edge.  \nHe doesn’t sustain contact after initial strikes as a lead blocker. Linebackers shed immediately and reach the ball carrier.  \nLast year, Wright displayed moments where he would roll his hips into an uppercut strike of an A-Gap linebacker after \ngetting strong depth into the pocket to address the blitz. He still overextends but when timed right, he generates a good \npunch.  \nBall Security: The ball swings as he runs and the elbow is loose from his frame. He favors carrying the ball under his right \narm—even on plays designed to the left. \nWright has 6 fumbles in 429 touches—a rate of 1 per 71.5. He’ll switch the ball to his left (boundary-side arm) once he \ngains the edge on a perimeter run.  \nDurability: Broken ankles—one in high school and then the other in 2021. Both required surgical repairs. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Wright from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStop-start quickness \n• \nMaking most of a bad-leverage scenario \n• \nHigh-point and curvilinear bend \n• \nIDs penetration, cutback, collision vs safety \n• \n2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n181",
        "analysis": "**Marcus Carroll:**\n\n* **Strengths:** Excellent vision, reading defenses well and identifying cutback lanes.  Efficient footwork, competent hands, and good power; strong in close quarters, initiating contact and maintaining balance. Solid speed and acceleration for short bursts.  Reliable ball security.\n* **Opportunities:** Improve burst and acceleration to create more separation. Needs to refine his timing on cuts, particularly in one-on-one situations.  Develop more effective maneuvers in close quarters.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Bilal Powell (versatile back who excels in zone running schemes), Devin Neal (similar build and running style), Ke'Shawn Vaughn (power back with receiving potential, but needing refinement), Chez Mellusi/Ky Thomas (similar skill sets, need to prove themselves).  Carroll seems to fall short of the high end of this spectrum.\n\n**Nay'Quan Wright:**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Excellent vision and ability to identify cutback lanes. Sudden stop-start movement and agility, enabling him to evade defenders.  Good power and balance, especially in direct contact.  Solid route running.\n* **Opportunities:** Needs significant improvement in his receiving skills, particularly in securing catches cleanly.  Must improve his blocking technique, particularly in maintaining contact and delivering more effective strikes. Improve ball security (carrying the ball consistently).  Acceleration and speed are pedestrian.\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** Jeff Wilson (similar power running style, but less consistent overall), Jake Funk (similar agility but with more questions around durability and consistency).  Wright's profile suggests a lower ceiling.\n\n\n**Overall:** Both Carroll and Wright project as late-round draft picks or undrafted free agents. They possess some valuable skills, but also significant areas for improvement.  Their NFL chances hinge on showing progress in their weaknesses and proving their value on special teams.

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB39 \nJersey: No.25 \nHeight/Weight: 6’0”/215 School: Georgia Southern  \nComparison Spectrum: Tevin Coleman – – X   \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 70.3 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. White is on \nthe cusp of the Reserve Tier: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUAB ‘23 \n• \nLouisiana-Monroe ‘23 \n• \nMarshall ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: White is a straight-line runner with limited speed and acceleration who can generate big gains on gap \nplays. His footwork and agility show up best in the open field. He’s a physical enough player who could make a club if he \noffers skill with kick coverage.  \nVision: White identifies penetration into the backfield and can efficiently bounce outside or cut back. He also identifies \npenetration from the edge and stays downhill to clear it before bouncing outside where the penetration came from.  \nHe’ll work into a tight crease on short-yardage gap plays but he must attack with his pads down and more conviction. White \ndoes so when the hole is at least shoulder-width. \nWhite has shown in one game that he doesn’t have to try to bounce plays outside where the leverage makes no sense to do \nso. He’ll take what he can get, even if it means working into unblocked defenders at the edge of a crease. This is the case \nwith interior penetration. With edge penetration on a play designed to go outside, White will try to bounce outside, which is \nfine but he shouldn’t compound the matter with an attempt to spin back inside when it doesn’t work. There are edge \ndesigns where he should cut the play back inside based on the leverage but doesn’t read it effectively.  \nWhite adjusts his stride length and pacing to press to the inside shoulder of a guard or center before attacking the outside \nshoulder. He doesn’t press deep enough on a lot of double teams and/or zone runs. He only gets 2-3 steps from his blocks \nand doesn’t draw unblocked defenders into bad angles.  \nWhite finds cutbacks in the hole on gap plays, following the puller into the crease, reading the containment to the play-side \nand getting depth into the blocker so he can cutback behind backside blocks. He’s at his best setting up pullers.  \nIf White spies a big crease with a linebacker to the opposite gap of it, he takes the crease without pressing the double team \ntoward the linebacker. He could get more if he pressed that linebacker.   \nWhite will press into a double team so one of his blockers can reach his combo block to the linebacker.  \nElusiveness: White can open his hips with the point of his toe to the boundary. White adjusts his stride length and pacing \nto press to the inside shoulder of a guard or center before attacking the outside shoulder. White gets his feet over low shots \nat the second level and secondary.  \nWhite spins away from safeties in the open field. He can set up the spin with a two-quick footwork pattern to prepare the \nchange of direction. On Toss around end, White needs two quick steps to transition downhill and inside the force player. He \ntries one step, but it isn’t quite sharp enough of a transition.  \nWhen in the open field, White has a good hip-shift style juke to make the safety coming downhill for him miss. He can follow \nup with a spin.  \nAcceleration: White has the acceleration to beat a front-side linebacker to the short edge but can’t turn the corner on the \nmiddle linebacker in position to wrap up. He can’t turn the corner on a high safety at the same side of the field as he’s \nworking to the boundary. He can beat linebackers around the far-side edge.  \nSpeed: Committee tier speed. He beats some defensive backs in the open field, but he needs an unfettered runway.  \n\n \n182 \nPower: White can pull through wraps from linebackers when it isn’t accompanied with a square hit. When running power in \nshort-yardage, White is too upright entering the crease and can get stuffed for little gain by a safety meeting him and \nwrapping him. If he dropped his pads at the entrance of creases as well as he does beyond the box, he’d be a much better \ntight-crease runner.  \nWhite uses his stiff-arm in the open field to ward off reaches and forced defenders to slide down his frame to wrap up.  \nDirect Contact Balance: White drops the pads into a linebacker meeting him in the secondary and runs over the top of the \ndefender. He has a capable balance-touch after doing so.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: White drops his pads and forearm into linebackers delivering glancing shots and knocks them \nover after he cuts back into the backside flat. He can also take a hard shot from a linebacker who hits and wraps his frame \nand continue into the crease, carrying the defender until wrapped by another defender.  \nRoutes: White leaks from the backfield, works to depth against the second-level defender, and settles into the open area. \nWhen the quarterback breaks the pocket, White works with his passer to an open space while maintaining a friendly position \nto the passer.  \nWhite has a double-up at the top of his stem to setup an out-breaking route to the flat against off-coverage. The move his \nsudden but lacks the patience to truly bait the defender. The turn also lacks a sharp drive step so the break drifts before the \nflat line step, but at this point the break can’t get flat enough.  \nWhite snaps his head to the quarterback during the turn but doesn’t snap his torso.  \nReceiving: White has good reach for targets ahead of his break path and below his knees. He can pluck the ball on the \nmove with extended arms and underhand attack ahead or behind his frame. He also digs out low throws when forced to \nleave his feet and embraces the fall. He tracks wide routes over his shoulder.  \nWhite can reach over his head for targets without leaving his feet unnecessarily and attacks with tight overhand position \nWhen White has lapses with overhand attack, he claps high-low on wide routes. He still catches the ball, but something to \nnote.  \nBlocking: When handling edge blitz assignments, White has a square and squat stance. He takes the air out of the \ninteraction with the defender and uses his hands with an uppercut motion to engage and tight enough with elbows bent to \nwork into the chest of the defender.  \nWhite overextends, leading with his head, when trying to earn deliver some pop with his strike because he’s not timing his \npunch and using his hips to roll up and through the contact.  \nHe’ll work inside-out as an edge protector and chip-release a defensive end with his forearm or shoulder but not so hard \nthat he dislodges the defender from his tackle’s advantageous position.  \nWhite has lapses where he turns his head away from the edge defender he’s going to engage and leads with his inside \nshoulder blind, which can lead to him missing the defender or being too out of position to follow up and sustain contact.  \nWhile can overrun his angle to the A gap to attack a defender looping inside. He will hustle to hook the defender way from \nthe quarterback, but the defender gets enough pressure to move the quarterback out of the pocket.  \nWhile also misdiagnoses Green Dawgs and opts to help with a double-team that won’t be as necessary, giving up the Green \nDawg off the edge.  \nWhite identifies edge pressure from defensive backs, works to depth, and delivers a cut block. He works across the defender \nand shoots through, but he shoots so high that he doesn’t leave his feet and he’s cutting above thighs so he can’t shoot \nthrough the body. This stops the defender temporarily but the lack of a true cut allows the defender to work around White \nafter the contact.  \nWhen he handles A-Gap pressure, White earns a square and squat stance. He can get a yard deeper than he does into the \npocket. He extends his hands with elbows bent and tight enough to reach the chest of the oncoming linebacker. He doesn’t \npunch, so the defender earns the first collision and while White can anchor after 1-2 steps pushed backward, he could avoid \nthis disadvantage with him initiating the strike.  \n\n \n183 \nWhite can work to the backside safety as a lead blocker working through the hole. He earns a chest-to-pads position and \nseals the defender to the inside.  \nBall Security: White carries the ball high to his chest but loose from his side. He can take a linebacker pulling at the ball \nwhile he’s wrapped and trying to pull loose. White has 1 fumble in 633 career touches. His one fumble came last year \nagainst Louisiana-Monroe on a hand off where penetration from the backside edge wrapped him from behind in the \nbackfield and he got ricocheted into a second penetrator on the front side who hit the ball while the backside defender was \npulling at his arm.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor White from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays):  \n• \nJalen White Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n184",
        "analysis": "Jalen White is a developmental running back prospect with a ceiling as a situational contributor in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision:** Shows good vision, particularly identifying and exploiting penetration in the backfield, effectively bouncing outside or cutting back. He's adept at setting up pullers and finding cutbacks on gap plays.\n* **Elusiveness:** Possesses solid elusiveness in the open field, utilizing effective hip shifts, jukes, and spins to avoid tackles.  He can get his feet over low shots at the second level and secondary.\n* **Power:**  Displays decent power, capable of pulling through tackles when the hit isn't perfectly square.  He can run over smaller defenders and has good balance after contact.\n* **Receiving:** Shows a good ability to catch the ball, even on the move, and displays good reach for targets both high and low.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a blocker, particularly in pass protection. He demonstrates a good stance and hand usage when handling edge blitzes.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Acceleration and Speed:** While he can beat some linebackers to the edge, his acceleration and overall speed are considered \"committee tier,\" limiting his ability to consistently break away from defenders. Improving this area is crucial for his NFL prospects.\n* **Power Running:** While possessing some power, he needs to improve his pad level consistently, especially in tight creases, to maximize his effectiveness as a power runner.\n* **Route Running:** His route running is inconsistent. While showing some ability to leak out and find space, his sharp turns and precision need refinement.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** His blocking is inconsistent.  He shows flashes of proficiency but often overextends or misreads assignments, leading to missed blocks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Top-End Speed:**  His speed is a significant limitation, preventing him from consistently breaking large runs.\n* **Inconsistent Pad Level:**  His tendency to run upright, especially in short-yardage situations, reduces his effectiveness in tight creases.\n* **Blocking Technique:** Needs to refine his blocking technique for consistency and improve his ability to accurately diagnose and react to pressure.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Tevin Coleman\n\nThis comparison highlights White's straight-line running style, ability to generate yards on gap plays, and physicality. However, Coleman had better speed and explosiveness than White currently projects to have.  White's ceiling might be closer to a backup/special teams contributor rather than a starting-caliber player like Coleman in his prime.\n"

Tech’24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Williams has the power, contact balance, and receiving skills that are competent by NFL standards. His \nacceleration and speed are questionable in this regard.  \nWilliams can improve his tackle-breaking if he improves the height of his feet as he runs through low shots. His blocking has \nlapses with technique. One moment, he’s delivering a sound punch. The next, Williams is overextending.  \nWilliams’ ball security is improving, but still sports a rate that’s on the low end of what’s acceptable. An ACL tear during his \ncareer requires some investigation into his medicals. If Williams improves his ball security and pass protection, his game is \nwell-rounded enough for him to contribute as a reserve.  \nVision: Williams identifies interior penetration during the exchange and efficiently bounces outside the pursuit. He’ll press \nan interior zone crease within two steps of the line before attempting a bounce. Williams also identifies edge penetration \nduring the exchange, veers inside of the pursuit and then rides the wave of his blocks back to the edge that defender \nvacated for a big gain.  \nWilliams will attack a crease decisively and accelerate into contact. As a gap runner, Williams gets past down blocks and \nsets up pullers.  \nElusiveness: Williams can open his hips with the point of the toe. At the short-side edge of the box, Williams can \ndecelerate with two steps and transition downhill.  \nWilliams plays with pacing and stride length to set up creases. He executes sharp pressure cuts and can executing them in \nopposite directions in succession.  \nWilliams has an effective spin that he uses with a stiff-arm to work through the wrap of a penetrating defensive lineman in \nthe back field.  \nAcceleration: Williams can bounce to the short-side edge and beat defensive linemen and linebackers. Defensive backs can \nrun him down within 15-30 yards. \nSpeed: Williams lacks the top-end speed to pull away from defensive backs on runs into the secondary that he bounced to \nthe short-side edge.  \nPower: Williams runs with a body lean so his pads are low. He dips his pads into impending contact from defensive tackles \nso he can power forward through wraps high to his frame.  \nHe keeps his feet moving through wraps to extend forward for extra yardage. He has the strength to force gang tackling \nwhen wrapped high at the line of scrimmage by a box defender.  \nWilliams has the stiff arm to swat away the reach of a defender and force him to slide down Williams’ frame for a second \ntackle attempt.  \nWilliams displays some ability to work through multiple reaches or a reach and a glancing shot. Williams can get his knees \nhigher to slip through lower-leg tackles.  \n\n \n185 \nDirect Contact Balance: Williams can run over direct contact from a flat-footed off-ball linebacker in the crease. He \nbounces off hard shots from safeties hitting him in the chest as he’s heading downhill through a crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: When Williams drops his pads into an oncoming safety or off-ball linebacker, Williams can \nbounce off the glancing shot. He bounces off glancing shots to his pads from defensive ends.  \nRoutes: Williams works to depth against second-level defenders and settles into the open area. When covered and/or his \nquarterback breaks the pocket, Williams continues working until he slips away from the coverage into the open zone and \nshows his eyes while tempoing his break to give his quarterback a throw window.  \nReceiving: Williams catches the ball with his arms extended below his knees. He can go from this position to a downhill run \nwith effective catch and pierce technique.  \nWilliams high-points the ball in the intermediate range of the field and retracts it quickly to his frame.  \nWith targets arriving away from his break path at chest-height, Williams attacks the ball with his feet on the ground at the \nearliest point with overhand position. He consistently keeps his feet on the ground with low and high throws.  \nBlocking: Williams earns a squat and square position in the pocket. He shuffles his feet effectively to work from gap to gap, \nearning appropriate position to help with interior double teams.  \nWilliams identifies edge pressure in the box or from a DB wide and late, and he slides to the edge of the pocket to earn a \nsquare and squat position with his elbow bent and head up when he begins his attack. He strikes with an uppercut without \noverextending and his hands are tight.  \nWhen he has lapses where he overextends, it’s against A-Gap pressure where he’s supposed to chip-release or windbacks \nagainst defensive linemen.  \nWilliams consistently keeps his head on a swivel when in the pocket and can work from a potential edge assignment to a \nlate-developing interior assignment.  \nWhere Williams can miss an assignment is when there are two defenders blitzing the same gap and one of them takes a \ndelayed approach, which lures Williams into a double-team with the first defender arriving and allowing the second defender \nthrough untouched.  \nWhen forced to handle one of two blitzes in the same gap, he takes the interior blitzer and that’s the appropriate one. \nWilliams is an effective lead blocker who will deliver multiple strikes to seal the inside and lead a runner downfield. He \ndoesn’t overextend and he keeps his hands tight.  \nBall Security: Williams carries the ball high to his chest and tight to his side at the elbow. He uses the arm that’s to the \nboundary-side of the play. 1 fumble per 70.5 touches. In 2022 and 2023 seasons, he had 1 fumble in 173 touches during \nthat span.  \nDurability: Torn ACL vs. New Mexico State in November 2021. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Williams from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPre-snap read/penetration management/big play \n• \nWorks to open zone on scramble/high-point/TD \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n186",
        "analysis": "Roydell Williams is a powerful, contact-balanced running back with decent receiving skills, but his speed and acceleration are limiting factors.  He projects as a reserve player in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power and Contact Balance:**  Excels at running through contact, showing good balance and ability to break tackles, especially when hitting lower.

He transitions smoothly from catch to run.\n* **Vision:**  Identifies running lanes effectively, showing the ability to adjust his path based on defensive penetration.\n* **Elusiveness:**  Possesses sharp cuts and a useful spin move to evade defenders.\n* **Blocking:**  Shows promise as a pass blocker, especially when maintaining his technique, but struggles with consistency, particularly against delayed blitzes. He is a competent lead blocker.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Ball Security:** While showing improvement, his fumble rate needs further reduction to become consistently reliable.\n* **Pass Protection Consistency:**  Needs to refine his pass-blocking technique to eliminate overextension and improve his reaction to multiple blitzes.  Improving this area would significantly elevate his NFL potential.\n* **Increased Speed and Acceleration:**  Improving his speed would open up more opportunities and make him a more versatile back.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Speed and Acceleration:** Lacks the top-end speed to consistently pull away from defensive backs.\n* **Pass Protection Technique:** Prone to overextension, leading to missed assignments.\n* **Ball Security:**  Fumble rate is still a concern.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report lists T.J. Yeldon and Trey Sanders as comparable players.  This suggests a player who can contribute as a short-yardage back and in the passing game, but lacks the breakaway speed of a top-tier running back.  The comparison highlights his power and receiving ability while acknowledging his limitations in speed and explosiveness.  His overall ceiling is likely that of a rotational player, rather than a feature back.\n"

Hankins is on the cusp of \nDevelopmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players.  \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nNorthwestern ‘23 \n• \nArizona ‘23 \n• \nLouisiana Tech ‘23 \n• \nNew Mexico State ‘23 \n• \nWestern Kentucky ‘23 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A powerful RB who could make a roster if his speed and burst are better than what I saw, Hankins is a \ndecisive runner on gap plays with efficient movement to avoid shots to his legs. He is an effective outlet receiver, but he \nmust develop a punch as a blocker – his size is no longer the asset it once was and he gives up pressure because he doesn’t \ntake the attack to the pass rush.  \nHankins’ size, strength, decision-making, and hands are compelling, but his athletic explosion may ultimately hold him back.  \nVision: Hankins displays knowledge and ability to press inside creases on perimeter runs and press outside creases to set \nup an off-tackle play. He’s decisive through the crease when it’s time to hit one.  \nHankins identifies edge penetration as he takes the exchange and can sidestep the pursuit. Hankins sets up gap plays and \nhe’ll find appropriate cutbacks when the front-side crease is not available. When running zone plays, Hankins will work \nwithin a step of his line to press a crease before finding a bounce lane.  \nElusiveness: Hankins needs only two quick steps to transition from an east-west track to a downhill track at the edge of \nthe tackle box. He executes small jump cuts and jump stops. Hankins opens his hips from these jump moves but doesn’t \npoint the toe a full 90 degrees. Hankins gets his feet up to work through low shots to his feet. Hankins will change stride \nlength to set up creases.  \nAcceleration: When Hankins has an open crease, he can accelerate past defensive linemen and some linebackers.  \nSpeed: Hankins can get run down by a safety over the span of 40-45 yards, but he can hold him off for that distance if that \nsafety is in the box.  \nPower: Hankins runs through low shots to his feet. He uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his upper body. Hankins \nkeeps his feet when defensive linemen wrap him high. He can stay upright until help arrives to push the pile.  \nHe can pull through multiple reaches and wraps from linebackers at the second level. Hankins combines a forearm shiver \nwith a spin to work past safeties in the open field.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Hankins drops his pads into defensive backs and wins downhill collisions with them, forcing them \nto drop low and wrap up. The same is true with linebackers in the hole. He’ll bounce off direct contact from a guard shoved \ninto him as he hits a crease downhill.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Hankins can stalemate indirect shots to his upper body from a defensive lineman in the \nbackfield.  \nRoutes: Hankins identifies the second-level defender, works to depth and tempos his breaks with his eyes to the \nquarterback when he reaches the open zone. Hankins has a nice two-quick release on a Texas route against off coverage.  \nReceiving: Hankins catches targets at the numbers with underhand position away from his frame. He also tracks targets \nover his shoulder and uses overhand position. He catches the ball away from his frame at the earliest window. Hankins also \nextends away from his frame and behind his break path and can transition smoothly downhill despite doing so. Hankins \ntransitions downhill immediately with effective catch and pierce technique.  \n\n \n187 \nBlocking: Hankins works tight to the inside or outside shoulder of his tackle to maintain good spacing and close rushing \nlanes as part of a double-team on a defensive linemen. Hankins keeps his hands tight and elbows bent to work into the \nchest plate of the defender.  \nHankins doesn’t deliver a punch, which opens him to catching contact from larger defenders who can then push-pull \nHankins, shedding him fast and take him to the ground.  \nHankins is savvy enough to peel off one A-gap defender after making contact to slow a delayed S blitz coming afterward \nthrough the same gap. After making contact with a larger defender, he can run his feet to push the opponent away from the \npath to the quarterback.  \nHankins earns a square and squat position to address pressure. He doesn’t overextend. All that is missing is a punch.  \nHankins recognizes T-E Twists and earns position to force the tackle further outside to the tackle rather than the nearest \ninside gap.  \nHankins can shield edge rushing linemen but without a strike, he is a one-and-done pass rusher who serves as a \nspeedbump on the way to the QB. He has shown on rare occasions the ability to punch and roll through his hips. He did this \nonce in the first 30 assignments.  \nBall Security: Hankins carries the ball close to his chest and uses the boundary-side arm.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Hankins from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHandling two A-Gap pressures arriving in waves \n• \nBroken tackles/contact balance \n• \nHankins Speed \n• \nHankins tough tracking  \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n188",
        "analysis": "Deion Hankins is a powerful running back with a compelling blend of size, strength, and decision-making, but his lack of elite athleticism could limit his NFL potential.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Decision-Making:**  Excellent at identifying and exploiting creases in the offensive line, showing decisiveness in hitting holes and making effective cutbacks.  He understands zone and gap schemes well.\n* **Power and Contact Balance:**  Runs through low tackles effectively, maintains balance against direct and indirect contact, and can push through multiple defenders.  He's strong in short-yardage situations.\n* **Receiving Skills:**  Reliable hands and good route running ability; shows the capacity to make catches away from his body and seamlessly transition into a run after the catch.\n* **Blocking (Potential):** Shows understanding of blocking schemes and good technique in maintaining position.  He demonstrates awareness of blitz pickups.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Speed and Burst:** His current speed and acceleration are considered below-average for the NFL level. Improvement here could significantly boost his draft stock.\n* **Develop a Punch as a Blocker:**  His size is an asset in pass protection, but he needs to add a powerful punch to consistently hold his own against NFL pass rushers.\n* **Consistency in Blocking:** While his awareness is good, he needs to improve his execution and add that punch to his blocking technique.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares him to Kregg Lumpkin and De'Veon Smith. This suggests a player who might be a power back with some receiving potential but lacking in elite speed and agility.  He's likely a depth player or special teams contributor unless he significantly improves his speed.  The comparison reflects a player on the cusp of making an NFL roster, with significant limitations to overcome.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nHankins possesses a solid foundation of skills, but his lack of elite speed and the need to refine his blocking technique will determine his NFL future. He's a project player who might be a late-round pick or undrafted free agent who needs considerable development.\n"

        "player_name": "Nate Carter",
        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB45 \nJersey No. 5 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/202 School: Michigan State / UConn \nComparison Spectrum: N/A \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 69.9 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. Carter is on the \ncusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nMaryland ‘24 \n• \nOhio State ‘24 \n• \nIowa ‘24 \n• \nMichigan ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A competent college runner who lacks top-end acceleration, and needs a lot of room to build speed, \nCarter lacks starter-level power and contact balance. He can bend around pursuit, but he lacks a strong toolbox of \nmovement to create yardage beyond a tight spin.  \nCarter is not a creative runner between the tackles and if the play isn’t blocked well, he struggles to find solutions that lead \nto positive yardage. Unless Carter becomes a special teams ace, it’s unlikely he makes an active roster.  \nVision: Carter identifies interior penetration during the exchange and can cut behind it into the open crease. He reads \nleverage on off-tackle zone and sets up cutbacks based on the flow of the defense to the cram and bounce creases.  \nHe must develop more efficient solutions against interior penetration. He’s more efficient and effective against penetration \ncoming from the edge into the backfield at the exchange point.  \nCarter has an effective stiff arm for warding off reaches to his frame as he works outside pursuit.  \nElusiveness: Carter adjusts his stride length to set up blocks on off-tackle zone. He has effective curvilinear speed to the \nshort-side edge to turn the corner.  \nCarter has a tight spin to work away from edge penetration reaching the exchange point with the quarterback. He needs \nthree transition steps to get downhill after working a perimeter runway to the far sideline.  \nAcceleration: Carter has the acceleration to reach the secondary when he has a clear runway. He can extend his run and \nforce safeties and corners to give chase. He can beat a cornerback playing the force roll to the far-side edge and turn the \ncorner on him.  \nSpeed: Carter can work past corners and safeties, but they can chase him down after covering 15-25 yards.  \nPower: Carter enters the crease with good pad level. He can bounce off hits to box defenders with his pads and keep his \nfeet moving, but he doesn’t generate a push against a lineman. Carter uses his stiff arm at the edge of the box to swat \naway reaches from inside pursuit.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Carter can run over a safety on the other side of the crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Carter can bounce off a defensive tackle’s glancing shot to his pads as he enters the crease. He \ncan bounce off and drop a defensive tackle hitting him in the backfield. Carter has an effective balance-touch.  \nRoutes: Carter identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and turns to the quarterback in the open area. He \ndoesn’t settle fast enough, drifting with a less friendly target. He will work to an open lane when his quarterback is forced \nfrom the pocket and present a friendly target.  \nReceiving: Carter high-points on shallow routes but his attack begins tight at the thumbs and then the hands come apart \nas he extends his arms and he finishes with a clap-attack.  \n\n \n189 \nCarter tracks over his shoulder and takes a hit to his legs as he secures the ball. He attacks at the earliest window with his \nfeet on the ground. He uses the appropriate attack for the location of the target.  \nCarter has a well-timed jump up and through on the back-shoulder fade and a quick pull-back. He can take a hit and wrap \nto the back as he performs the pull-back. He embraces the fall. \nCarter can win against tight coverage when breaking across the field, especially when he catches the ball at the earliest \nwindow. Carter can extend one hand high and over his downfield shoulder to make a stabbing underhand grab of the target. \nCarter catches and pierces downhill.  \nBlocking: Carter identifies edge pressure. He’ll slide to the edge with a squat stance, square the defender, and deliver his \nhands tight to the opponent’s chest with some force. He overextends so he’s out of position as soon as he finishes his strike, \nif not before.  \nThe overextension makes it difficult to move his feet fast enough to stay with the defender, and it renders his blocks one-\nand-done. This happens with edge pressure where he has to fan out.  \nWhen Carter can meet the defender coming downhill, he can deliver a hard and tight punch. He’ll stone an A-gap \nlinebacker.  \nCarter is a skilled cut blocker who can identify a cross blitz, take the correct option, and time his cut with good height. He \nworks across the defender and shoots through the target—widening the opponent from the pocket.  \nHe has lapses in tight pockets with getting across the defender when it’s an interior blitz. He takes an angle that makes it \ndifficult for him to work across the frame. Instead, his head slams into the thigh or hip of the defender.  \nCarter misses blitz assignments when the defense sends multiple defenders to one side of center. He’ll slide toward a two-\nman blitz outside when there’s a linebacker delaying his blitz to the inside. Carter misses that delayed blitz.  \nHe isn’t cognizant of potential green dawgs and has missed them on the backside when there was more than enough time \nto check.  \nBall Security: Carter carries the ball close to his chest, but swings it away from his frame as he runs.  His elbow is loose \nfrom his frame. He  has opportunities to switch the ball to his boundary arm and will even extend the ball away from his \nframe to carry it like an option quarterback before switching it back to his inside arm.  \nCarter’s default arm is his right arm unless it’s a designed run to the left where the default exchange places to the ball to \nhis left arm. He tightens his security when he can anticipate an oncoming hit to his ball-carrying arm. Carter has 4 fumbles \nin 555 touches during his 4-year career – 1 per 138.75 touches.  \nDurability: Redshirt in 2020. Season-ending shoulder injury against Michigan in September 2022. It was a second-degree \nshoulder separation.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Carter from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nJump up and through, pull-back through contact, late-hands, embraces the fall \n• \nHighlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n190 \nRB Ja’Quinden Jackson RSP Scouting Profile \n \nRSP Ranking: RB46 \nJersey No. 22 \nHeight/Weight: 6’1”/229 School: Arkansas/Utah/Texas (QB) \nComparison Spectrum: Chris Brooks - - X \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 69.7 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. Jackson is on \nthe cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n \n• \nAuburn ‘24 \n• \nTexas A&M ‘24 \n• \nTennessee ‘24 \n• \nMissouri ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: A powerful back, Jackson is a decisive gap runner. When he gets downhill, he can run through contact \nand drag defenders for extra yardage.  \nJackson is nimble for his size. He’s capable of making effective cutbacks in traffic and the open field. When he gets a wide \nrunway through a crease, he uses his power as a bully pulpit to dictate terms against linebackers and safeties.  \nAn effective outlet receiver who tracks targets over his shoulder and transitions downfield, Jackson must work on his pass \nprotection. He’s perpetually 1-2 steps late with identifying blitzes that are his to pick up. He won’t have as much latitude \nwith NFL blitzers if he’s this late on Sundays.  \nRight now, his best chance of early success as a blocker comes as part of a double-team or chip-release work. You’ll see \nsome splashy highlight plays, like his fireman’s carry/powerslam of the Auburn defender, but they are the exception to his \nbody of work in 2024.  \nJackson would be higher on the RSP’s board if he could hold onto the ball. Jackson has 7 fumbles in 417 touches – 1 per \n59.6 touches. His best stretch was 170 touches without a fumble in 2023, but he had 3 of his 7 fumbles in 2024. \nIf Jackson can develop ball security, he could emerge as a playable reserve with a situational role. If he improves his pass \nprotection, he could become part of a rotation in a gap scheme.  \nVision: Jackson can identify penetration off the edge and work away from the unanticipated obstacle. Jackson follows \npullers effectively on gap plays. He knows when to jump ahead of a backside puller when there’s edge penetration that \ncould thwart the normal development timeline of the play. \nJackson can press outside within a step of penetration and cut downhill through the open crease behind the penetration. He \nmakes efficient cutbacks on stretch plays.  \nOn well-blocked perimeter runs to the far-sideline, Jackson will press the safety and wide end into blocks before bouncing \nfurther to the boundary—stair-stepping his path to open space.  \nElusiveness: Jackson has effective curvilinear speed around the short corner of the box and bend inside the force defender \nto turn the corner. He can also deliver a long plant step outside and toward the middle of a double-team into a pressure cut \nthat takes him to the inside shoulder of the inside defender.  \nJackson can decelerate with the space of two quick steps at the second level after accelerating downhill. He can transition \ndownhill at the short-side edge or far-side edge within the span of two quick steps. He has a nice spin inside a fill crease \nagainst a defensive lineman filling it. He also uses the spin in combination with transitions downhill of force defenders.  \nJackson can adjust his stride length and open his hips with the point of a toe to the boundary. He can combine the hip-\nopener move with a jump stop to work away from slanting defenders into the backfield.  \nJackson is nimble enough to get his feet over low shots from linebackers shooting the crease into the path Jackson on a \nperimeter run. He gets his feet and knees high enough to work over the arms and body of the defender on the ground.  \n\n \n191 \nJackson will adjust his pacing with perimeter runs.  \nAcceleration: Jackson can turn the corner on an outside linebacker in the flat. He can get caught behind by an inside \nlinebacker after working downhill.  \nSpeed: Jackson can extend runs into the secondary and maintain separation against many linebackers. He lacks starter-\ncaliber speed for the NFL.  \nPower: Jackson pulls through the reach of an outside linebacker. He drops his pads into oncoming defenders and pull \nthrough contact. He’ll pull through multiple reaches in a crease and keep his feet moving through a pile.  \nHe pulls along box defenders of all sizes when wrapped high. His stiff arm has the reach to ward off pursuit as he turns the \ncorner.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Jackson can win a direct collision with a linebacker at the other end of a crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Jackson can run through a hit to the chest of a linebacker over the top.  \nRoutes: Jackson uses a read step with a wipe counter against off-coverage with inside shade. He uses a double up at the \ntop of a stem and a wipe counter. He identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area.  \nReceiving: Jackson can look a flat, swing, or wide route into his underhand attack away from his frame that arrives over \nhis shoulder. He extends with overhand position for targets arriving over his shoulder at a greater height. He can high-point \nwith targets over his shoulder and downfield.  \nHe attacks targets at the earliest window and keeps his feet on the ground when it’s unnecessary to leap for a target. \nJackson will catch and pierce downhill.  \nBlocking: Jackson earns a squat and square stance. He shuffles his feet well to move laterally and can get square to \nmultiple assignments during a snap. Jackson can overextend, leaning with his pads into the pads of the opponent.  \nJackson tips off cut blocks against edge defenders and doesn’t get far enough across the frame or shoot through the \ncontact. He even misses edge cut blocks when he shoots with his head up.  \nStill, Jackson has shown he can work across a defensive end’s frame, shoot through the body of the defender with good \nheight and keep his eyes up. If anything, Jackson shoots a little too high to the waistline, but he slows the defender’s stride.  \nWith standup assignments, Jackson’s feet aren’t in control when he works downhill toward a defender, but he gets his hands \ntight, his elbows bent, and he delivers a hard shot to the chest of an opponent. He can drop a nose tackle with the strike.  \nWhen Jackson anchors his feet effectively, he can win against blitzing DBs and LBs off the edge. He can square A-Gap \npressure and move his feet to get the defender wide of the pocket.  \nJackson is perpetually 1-2 steps late with identifying blitzes that are his to pick up. He won’t have as much latitude with NFL \nblitzers if he’s this late on Sundays. Right now, his best chance of early success as a blocker comes as part of a double-\nteam or chip-release work. You’ll see some splashy highlight plays, like his fireman’s carry/powerslam of the Auburn \ndefender, but they are the exception to his body of work in 2024.  \nBall Security: Jackson has 7 fumbles in 417 touches – 1 per 59.6 touches. His best stretch was 170 touches without a \nfumble in 2023, but he had 3 of his 7 fumbles in 2024. Jackson carries the ball under his boundary-side arm and holds the \nball tight to his chest.

Griffin is on \nthe cusp of Reserve: Contributor with limitations in scope and execution. \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nSDSU ‘24 \n• \nOregon ‘24 \n• \nPurdue ‘24 \n \nThe Elevator Pitch: Griffin has the athletic ability and skills to become a viable reserve if he can learn to hold onto the \nball. \nVision: On off-tackle zone, Griffin will press inside within 2-3 steps of the line or the unblocked defender and bounce the \nplay outside. Up the middle, Griffin will press within 1-2 steps of the line and find the adjacent gap. He reads penetration on \nDuo and avoids the linebacker working through the A-Gap into the backfield.  \nGriffin can be patient to a crease, approaching slow and hitting it full speed when he anticipates his block. He doesn’t \nanticipate pulling guards to the correct side and doesn’t press the puller effectively into the linebacker.  \nElusiveness: Griffin has some curvilinear bend and functional speed. He is efficient with timing his vaults for final yardage \ninside the five to get past pursuit and over the pylon. Griffin also spins off contact.  \nGriffin has an excellent one-step transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill approach with downhill pursuit cutting \noff the edge. He executes it at full speed and sharp enough to make the defender miss.  \nGriffin sets up lead blocks on gap plays with changes of stride length and pacing. He opens his hips with economy on \nCounter when setting up pullers with a tight press to the line toward the backside puller and then opens up to bounce the \nplay outside.  \nAcceleration: Griffin has the acceleration to beat linebackers to the near sideline and accelerate past the same side corner \nin pursuit from the inside. \nSpeed: Griffin has starter-level speed based on his in-game work. He can maintain separation against defensive backs—at \nleast flipping the field.  \nPower: Griffin finishes runs with his pads low enough to work under contact. He bounces off glancing shots from all levels \nof defenders hitting him high and he works through reaches and wraps below his waist from linebackers. He can work \nthrough multiple forms of these two types of contact during a carry.  \nGriffin has a capable stiff arm with good location and timing against defensive tackles on perimeter runs and safeties at the \nopposite end of a north-south crease.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Griffin bounces off direct shots to his chest and pads from defensive backs.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Griffin bounces off glancing shots to his pads from defensive tackles in the hole. He has a \ncapable balance touch after staggering off that contact. He’ll also bounce of light glancing shots to his pads from safeties \nwhen he has a runway into the contact.  \nRoutes: Griffin has the deep bend with his hips into three-step breaks on stop routes. When running zone routes, he \nidentifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly position to the \nquarterback. He’ll also tempo the break away from defenders to stay in the open zone.  \nReceiving: Griffin catches targets at the numbers with overhand position. When facing tight coverage trailing on a slant, \ncircle, or Texas route, Griffin must extend his arms to the earliest point. His hands are too tight to his frame, and it allows \nthe trailing defender to knock the ball from his grip.  \n\n \n193 \nGriffin catches and pierces downhill when transitioning from receiver to runner.  \nBlocking: Griffin reads T-E twists and delivers his hands from a squat and square position into the defender’s chest. He’ll \nslide off an assignment that works its way into his teammate on a double team and works across the defender’s back so he \ncan take on an edge defender.  \nGriffin overextends into contact with linebackers and his one shot is more of a speed bump as a result.  \nHe’s willing to chip-release as a route runner against edge defenders. He’ll deliver a substantial shot without dislodging the \ndefender from the primary blocker.  \nGriffin works across the frame and through the frame of a linebacker to cut an A-Gap blitz. His timing his good, but he must \nkeep his head up so he earns the necessary height into the block.      \nBall Security: Griffin tucks the ball under his right arm after the catch even when outside the left numbers and pursuit is \non his right side. He carries the ball high to his chest, but he has lapses in the open field on bounces where the ball dips low \nand near his waist as he’s accelerating in the open field.  \nOn plays designed to the left as a runner, he takes the exchange and tucks it to his boundary-side arm.  \nGriffin has 280 touches with 8 fumbles—4 of them in his first 73 touches in 2024 and the other 4 in 206 touches between \n2019-2023.  \nDurability: Griffin missed final seven games of 2024 season after an ACL tear at Colorado State.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Griffin from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nOne-step transition downhill \n• \n2020 Highlights \n• \n2019 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n194",

He struggles with anticipating pulling guards and effectively pressing them into linebackers, hindering his performance in certain run schemes. His pass protection, while willing, also needs refinement to prevent being a liability.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Ball Security (reiterated):**  A major concern that needs immediate attention.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  A direct comparison is difficult due to the inconsistency and ball security issues.  However, his athleticism reminds one of a smaller, less polished version of players like  **Darrell Henderson** (for his speed and elusiveness) but with the fumble issues being a significantly larger obstacle to overcome.  He might also be compared to a less-refined version of **J.K. Dobbins** in terms of his burst and power,  but again, the ball security drastically lowers the comparison.  The comparison would need to be heavily caveated by focusing on the negative aspects.\n"

He presses gap and zone blocks within a step of his blockers and finds the cutback lane.  \nHe’s an effective cutback runner who can bait second-level defenders too far to one gap and then cutback to another.  \nWaters will press inside to set up runs designed for the perimeter. He’ll get within 2-3 steps of his blockers or pursuit.  \nHe’s a tight-crease runner. He’s patient to the hole and decisive through it.  \nElusiveness: Waters has an effective pressure cut to cutback against the grain of a DL’s slant into the backfield.  \nWhen transitioning downhill on a run that begins with the exchange flanked to one side of the quarterback and transitions \ndownhill to the opposite guard, Waters can make the move within two steps. He’s also effective with a two-step transition \nwhen working outside the hash and transitioning downhill in space against a flat defender pursuing from over the top.  \nWaters lacks notable acceleration and speed, so the two-step transition at his pace appears so, but it’s in control and it \nmakes defenders miss who are on top ACC teams. Waters also lifts his feet away from shots to his lower legs, kicking his \nheels toward his backside to do it.  \nWhen working behind blockers setting up a perimeter run, Waters shuffles his feet to keep his hips downhill as he slides \naway from filled gaps to hit an open crease. It also aids his stop-start quickness, helping him accelerate past box defenders.  \nWaters adjusts his stride length to avoid penetration. Waters doesn’t overuse the spin. When he uses it, it’s tight enough for \nhim to pull through a defender’s reach.  \nWaters has an effective jump-stop that he combines with a spin and he has used it to avoid slanting defensive linemen in \nsuccession as he navigates away from the backfield.  \nAcceleration: Waters has the acceleration to work past defensive linemen to the short side or far side. To the far side, \nWaters can accelerate past linebackers and safeties and turn the corner on them.  \nSpeed: When Waters reaches his top gear, he can hold off a safety and cornerback with backside pursuit on the same side \nof the field for 20-30 yards when he can veer away from the opponent. His top speed is good enough to flip the field and \nmaintain separation from box corners and safeties.  \nPower: When wrapped high by box defenders, Waters keeps his feet moving to extend forward and forces the defense to \nrally and gang tackle. His pad level can be lower when working through a crease when he’s not expecting contact. When he \ndoes this, he runs through trash.  \nWhen expecting contact, he drops his pads to initiate contact with the defender. Waters’ stiff arm lacks consistent accuracy \nof placement, but when he has had success on perimeter runs warding off the edge containment.  \n\n \n195 \nDirect Contact Balance: Waters bounces off direct shots to his frame from safeties when meeting them at the second \nlevel of the defense through a crease. He can ping-pong off that safety into a glancing shot from a linebacker and maintain \nhis balance.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Waters will drop his pads and/or bring the forearm shiver to drop a safety delivering a glancing \nshot aimed for Water’s frame.  \nWaters bounces off glancing shots to his pads from a defensive end coming down the line and slanting into an interior gap. \nHe forces the defender to slide down his frame to wrap up.  \nWaters bounces off hits to his legs and hips from linebackers meeting him with a glancing shot while working downhill \nthrough a crease.  \nRoutes: Waters works to depth against the second-level defender and settles into the open area, creating a friendly target \nfor the quarterback. \nReceiving: Although not as fluid as top athletes, Waters can turn behind his break path to catch a wide route thrown at his \nback hip and spin up the field. He extends his arms from his waist to attack the ball with his hands and with underhand \nposition. He tracks the ball over his shoulder, but has a tendency to clap-attack the ball when it arrives on his frame.  \nBlocking: Waters identifies A-Gap blitzes, slides across the back of the center and squares with a squat position for the \nblock. He must time and deliver a punch so he doesn’t take the contact and get driven off-balance, and/or into the pocket. \nHe throws an uppercut but he must time the punch so the defender doesn’t get his hands on Waters first and slide \ninside/outside the back. He also doesn’t get tight enough into the defender’s body and it gives them room to slide \ninside/outside the strike. \nWhen double-teaming an end with a tackle, Waters earns a tight position to the defender’s chest and the outside shoulder \nof the tackle so the end can’t split the two teammates.  \nWaters identifies corner blitzes off the short-side edge and walls off the defender effectively. Water works inside-out from \nthe pocket to track T-E twists. When taking on a defensive tackle, Waters drops his frame into the contact and doesn’t use \nhis hands, which will get him shed in the NFL a lot sooner than it does in the ACC. \nHe runs his feet after contact to shield defenders as a lead blocker. Waters delivers chips with his pads and/or forearm that \nare violent enough to generate a collision and slow the opponent but knock the defender off the offensive lineman, which is \ngood.  \nBall Security: Waters carries the ball high to his chest, but the elbow is wide of his side. He uses the boundary-side arm. \nHe has 4 fumbles in 404 touches—1 per 101 touches.  \nWhen working downhill, Waters keeps the elbow tight to his frame when working through a crease. When working East-\nWest, Waters’ arm elbow gets too loose/wide from his frame.  \nDurability: He began his career in 2019. He redshirted and took a Covid Year. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Waters from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \n2024 Highlights \n• \n2023 Highlights \n• \n2022 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n196",
        "analysis": "**Jordan Waters - NFL Draft Profile Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Cutback Ability:** Waters excels at identifying gaps and cutback lanes, effectively using patience and decisiveness to exploit defensive weaknesses. He shows an advanced understanding of blocking schemes and uses this to his advantage.\n* **Elusiveness:** Despite lacking elite acceleration and speed, Waters displays good agility and change-of-direction skills. He utilizes effective techniques like pressure cuts, jump-stops, and spins to avoid tackles, particularly impressive against ACC-level competition.\n* **Contact Balance:** Waters demonstrates exceptional balance, bouncing off hits from multiple defenders while maintaining forward momentum.  He effectively uses his pads and body positioning to absorb contact.\n* **Receiving Skills:** While not a top-tier receiver, Waters shows the ability to catch the ball in various situations and turn upfield after the catch.\n* **Blocking:** Shows potential as a pass blocker, identifying blitzes and effectively engaging blockers.  His technique needs refinement, but the instincts are there.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Acceleration and Top Speed:** Waters' lack of elite speed limits his breakaway potential. Improvement in this area would significantly elevate his draft stock.\n* **Refine Blocking Technique:** While showing promise, his pass-blocking technique needs refinement to consistently handle NFL-level defensive linemen.  Specifically, improving hand placement and timing is crucial.\n* **Enhance Stiff Arm:** His stiff arm lacks consistency in placement, hindering his ability to consistently break tackles on the perimeter.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumble rate is relatively low, maintaining a secure grip, especially on east-west runs, needs attention.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nNo direct comparison is provided in the profile.  Based on the strengths and weaknesses, a potential comparison could be a smaller, more elusive back with good vision but lacking elite speed.  Players like **James Conner (early-career) or a smaller, more agile version of Derrick Henry** (focused on his elusiveness and contact balance rather than pure power) might be considered.  However, this is speculative without a more concrete comparison.  His current developmental score suggests he's likely a late-round pick or undrafted free agent, destined for a practice squad or special teams role initially.\n"

As a zone runner, Watkins will \npress within three steps of his blockers before executing a cut/bounce to the open crease. He can press much deeper, but \nhe has a habit of making his cut too early.  \nWhen Watkins presses within a step of the line, it’s usually because he saw an open crease that closed as he reached the \nline of scrimmage and had to decelerate and cutback/bounce.  \nWatkins is a patient runner on perimeter plays, pressing lead blocks to linebackers and defensive backs get pressed into the \nblock.  \nElusiveness: Watkins flips his hips in tight space to work away from pursuit. He only needs two quick steps to transition \nfrom a perimeter path to a downhill path. \nWatkins can decelerate and open his hips with the point of the toe to bounce/cutback from the downhill pursuit. Watkins \nadjust his stride length to set up pullers on running plays. He uses spins when wrapped high so he can work through \ncontact.  \nWatkins only needs two quick steps to transition downhill at the far-side edge of the box on a perimeter run. Watkins has a \ndouble-up to set up defenders pursuing him over the top. He kicks his heels back and knees up with his stride when \ndefenders shoot low.  \nAcceleration: Watkins can beat defensive linemen to the short edge on a designed perimeter run. His acceleration is \nlacking—defensive tackles can work from the hash to the numbers and case Watkins down for minimal gains even when \nWatkins earns the ball in open field.  \nWatkins can beat middle linebackers and some one-high safeties to the edge and get downhill of them on runs to the far-\nside flat.  \nSpeed: He can get a step on a middle linebacker coming from the middle of the field to cover Watkins up the boundary on a \nwheel route.  \nPower: Watkins initiates contact between the tackles or at the end of a crease. He drops his pads into contact. He can get \nhis pads under high wraps from linebackers and pull them along for extra yardage.  \nWhen wrapped low, Watkins keeps his feet moving as he’s heading downhill. He can drag edge defenders for extra yards as \nhe hits the crease.  \nWatkins has a stiff arm that he times effectively when warding off reaches from linebackers and defensive backs on runs \nthrough downhill creases and on the perimeter. He forces opposing defenders wrap up.  \nHe wards off defensive ends effectively when turning the corner on a perimeter run. Watkins also uses the forearm shiver \ninto direct contact and this helps him win collisions against defenders meeting him with downhill momentum.  \n\n \n197 \nDirect Contact Balance: Watkins can stalemate a linebacker when Watkins has the momentum downhill into the collision \nand the linebacker is flat-footed. He wins collisions with safeties to his frame and legs when both he and his opponent have \ndownhill momentum into the contact.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Watkins will stalemate a hard hit from a linebacker coming downhill if Watkins also has \nmomentum downhill. He bounces off hits to his hips and sides from safeties with downhill momentum when he also has that \nmomentum.  \nRoutes: He can identify second-level defenders, work to depth, and settle into the open zone.  \nReceiving: Watkins can reach behind his frame during his break and attack the ball wide of his body. He uses tight \noverhand position to secure the ball. He uses tight underhand position with arms extended to the earliest point of the target \nto attack targets at waist height.  \nWatkins has lapses where he clap-attacks targets with overhand position tight to his chest. Watkins transitions downhill with \nefficient catch and pierce technique. He snatches high-points thrown with zip, retracting them quickly to his frame as he \ncatches and pierces downhill.  \nBlocking: He’ll deliver chips with an uppercut before leaking into the flat. He’ll also deliver chips as the inside man on a \ndouble team and do it when he should have clearly seen that the defender beat Watkins’ tackle with an inside move and \nthat chip was a mere attaboy on the defender’s way to the quarterback. He must show more discernment and adjust.  \nWatkins can be late to come off a double team and punch an edge defender. He can get caught taking contact. When he \nstrikes, he uses uppercut punches that have pop.  \nWhen he has time to square a target, he sinks his hips, delivers his hands with double-uppercuts that are tight enough to \nreach the defender’s chest, and he strikes with the roll of his hips.  \nWatkins delivers cut blocks with effective height, timing, and positioning across the fame of the opponent. He also shoots \nthrough the defender and keeps his head up to see what he’s hitting. He must get more depth in the pocket when he cuts \nso the defender has no chance of falling over the top of the hit and extending his frame into the quarterback.  \nWatkins is effective at cutting edge defenders and earning appropriate depth in the pocket to set it up. Watkins spots \ndelayed safety blitzes, peeling back to the backside B or C Gap and delivering a significant chip that forces the defender \nwide of the pocket.  \nBall Security: Watkins carries the ball close to his chest and uses his boundary-side arm.  \nHe has three career fumbles and all of them came in 2021 on 106 of his 332 career touches. His career rate is 1 fumble per \n110.3 touches. His 2021 rate is 1 per 35.

        "analysis": "Anthony Watkins is a developmental running back prospect with a blend of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Patience:**  Watkins shows good vision, identifying holes and patiently waiting for blocks to develop before hitting creases. He's particularly effective in zone schemes.\n* **Elusiveness:** He possesses impressive agility and hip flexibility, allowing him to make quick cuts and evade tackles in tight spaces.  He utilizes spins and changes of pace effectively.\n* **Power and Contact Balance:** Despite not being exceptionally large, Watkins runs with surprising power, initiating contact and dragging defenders for extra yards. He demonstrates good balance, especially when hitting the hole with momentum.\n* **Receiving Ability:** Shows potential as a receiver, displaying reliable hands and the ability to adjust to the ball in the air. He demonstrates good technique in securing the ball.\n* **Blocking:**  Watkins shows effort in pass protection, delivering effective chips and cut blocks, but his timing and decision-making need refinement.  He has the potential to be a solid blocker with coaching.\n* **Ball Security:**  Despite three fumbles in his early career, he has significantly improved his ball security, showing a strong record over his last 311 touches.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improving Acceleration:** While he can beat some defenders to the edge, his acceleration isn't elite. Improving his burst would significantly enhance his rushing ability.\n* **Refining Route Running:** He shows flashes of good route running but needs to refine his technique for consistency at the next level.\n* **Consistent Blocking:** While he has the potential to be a strong blocker, he needs to improve his decision-making and timing to avoid being caught out of position.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The report doesn't offer a specific NFL player comparison.  His skillset suggests a potential role as a change-of-pace back or a special teams contributor who could develop into a more versatile player.  A potential comparison might be a less explosive version of a player like  Alexander Mattison (power and receiving skills) or a smaller, more agile version of a player like Damien Harris (power runner).  However, this is highly speculative without a concrete comparison.\n\n**Overall:** Watkins is a raw prospect with intriguing traits. His success in the NFL will depend on his ability to improve his acceleration, refine his technique in route running and blocking, and consistently avoid turnovers. He projects as a late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent who will likely need time to develop.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB50 \nJersey: No.4 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/190 School: Miami/SMU  \nComparison Spectrum: N/A  \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 63 = Developmental: Special Teams, end of bench, and practice squad players. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUNC ‘22 \n• \nPitt ’22  \n• \nOU ‘23 \n• \nTulane ‘23 \n \nWhere has the player improved? Knighton has improved his pass protection but still has lapses with effort to throw his \nhands and earn a square position.  \nVision: Knighton has to read leverage faster so he can make more efficient bounces as needed. He will press within a step \nof his blockers to set up cutbacks and bounces, but his footwork must become more efficient so he can avoid traffic and \nreach the hole.  \nKnighton has inside zone plays where he should press deeper but attempts the bounce way too early. This is especially the \ncase when he has a double team inside and an unblocked linebacker that he could lead into one of the linemen with a deep \npress. \nWhen Knight actually maintains a deep press and then bounces, he bounces too far outside his blocks and gives pursuit an \neasier angle to attack. He’s trying too hard to get into open space rather than stay downhill and maximize the space that’s \nthere. He’s losing yardage as a result.  \nKnighton can identify penetration off the edge into the backfield and weave his way into an open crease. He must improve \nhis identification of potential cutbacks on perimeter runs. He must see the edge containment earlier.  \nElusiveness: Knighton can be 1-2 steps late with when he should begin his bounce outside. He doesn’t point the toe and \nopen the hips. Instead, he cuts his stride with stutter steps that waste space and places him in harm’s way of the defenders \nshooting the gap into the backfield.  \nKnighton can adjust stride length and pacing. Once he learns to press creases deeper on a consistent basis, these skills will \nhave added value. \nKnighton has the quickness and explosion to execute jump cuts to work away from pursuit over the top of him as he \napproaches the line of scrimmage.  \nHe combines a pressure cut with a spin to beat linebackers meeting him in the hole. He only needs 1-2 steps to transition \ndownhill from a perimeter approach. Knight has quick and effective two-step jukes.  \nHe can point the toe and open the hips to bounce 90 degrees from a press toward the line of scrimmage.  \nAcceleration: Knighton has the acceleration to beat safeties up the middle when he earns a clean hole into the secondary. \nSpeed: Knighton has the straight-line speed to run past linebackers on vertical routes if allowed to run free during his stem. \nHe can beat safeties and hold off some cornerbacks in the open field.  \nPower: Knighton keeps his feet moving through wraps high on his frame. He can drop his pads after contact so he’s leaning \nforward through the wrap. He doesn’t drop his pads low enough at the point of attack and the act of dropping the pads is \neither late or small amount just before the collision occurs.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Knighton has good pad level in the crease and can run through contact from a linebacker meeting \nhim head-on at the other end of the hole. His pad level is good enough to knock the linebacker on his back, but Knighton’s \nalignment and balance aren’t enough for him to remain upright through the entire interaction. He can keep his legs moving \nfor an extra 1-2 yards after the collision.  \n\n \n199 \nIndirect Contact Balance: When Knighton has downhill momentum, he can continue forward through an indirect strike of \na safety pursuing hard from the backside flat and delivering the hit from over the top.  \nI love that he’ll accelerate into a safety in the open field, but he must drop his pads more so he’s striking with his shoulders \nand the ball isn’t exposed.  \nHe can bounce off glancing shots from off-ball linebackers in the crease.  \nRoutes: Knight delivers a pace change with his hip shifts against off coverage and adds a head fake to the move. However, \nthe timing and placement of his feet during the act of the hip shift don’t dramatically sell the maneuver and isn’t that \neffective.  \nWhen working against off-coverage in zone, he’ll identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and settle into the open \nspot. He creates a friendly target with his chest and eyes. \nReceiving: Knighton’s hands can be too wide at the catch point. He’ll use the optimal overhand position for targets away \nfrom his frame at number’s height but the hands aren’t close enough.  \nKnighton tracks the ball over his shoulder against tight coverage on bullet/wheel routes. He can snare the ball with \nunderhand position and retract to his frame as he’s wrapped from behind or hit hard in the chest from a safety over the top. \nKnighton also tracks targets behind his back hip while breaking away from the trajectory of the target. He is prone to clap-\nattacking these targets. He can catch them, but it increases the odds of fighting the ball.  \nBlocking: Knighton will square linebackers, slide and re-adjust his position if needed, and cultivate a good bend of the \nknees and hips. He strikes with an uppercut but overextends so his face and pads often contact the opponent before his \nhands. His elbows are also wide when he sets up to strike and this doesn’t give Knighton great control of his hand \nplacement.  \nEven so, Knighton makes the effort to re-work his hands and when he strikes, he delivers an uppercut with a roll of his hips. \nAfter contact, he moves his feet to generate a push in the direction he desires.  \nDespite this level of skill and potential to refine it, there are reps where Knighton will have a one-on-one with an edge \nrusher and show little effort. He’ll drop one shoulder toward a defender without squaring or using his hands. The defender \nuses that effort as a small speedbump on the way to the passer if he doesn’t earn a solid strike early. He has done this for \nthe past two seasons at SMU.  \nHe must be more cognizant of identifying A-gap pressure—even when he’s taking play-fakes.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Knighton can earn too much depth before squaring and allow the defender to run by him. He should \nsquare earlier and shuffle his feet to slide where the opponent moves.  \nBall Security: Knighton carries the ball against his chest, but the elbow is loose from his frame. He primarily carries the \nball under his right arm even when working up the left side of the field. He’ll place the ball in harm’s way by dropping the \npads into a safety with his ball-carrying arm as the side striking the defender. He has lost the ball in this situation because \nof the lack of security and the decision.  \nKnighton averages a fumble every 44 attempts with 11 fumbles in 487 touches. He had enough off an improvement in 2023 \nthat climbed to the Reserve Tier out of the Free Agent Tier. \nDurability: No significant injuries to report. \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Knighton from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nJaylan Knight 2022 Miami Highlights \n \n \n \n\n \n200",
        "analysis": "Jaylan Knighton is a developmental running back prospect with a RSP ranking of RB50.  His strengths lie in his acceleration, straight-line speed, and elusiveness in the open field. He shows flashes of excellent jump cuts and juke moves, capable of making defenders miss in tight spaces. He also possesses decent power and can run through contact, though his pad level needs improvement for consistent success.  Knighton's route running shows potential, especially against zone coverages, and he displays the ability to track the ball well in receiving situations, although hand placement needs refinement.\n\nHowever, Knighton's weaknesses are significant and hold him back. His vision and decision-making need considerable improvement; he often bounces outside too early or presses too shallow, limiting his effectiveness.  His pass protection is inconsistent, lacking effort and proper technique.  Ball security is also a major concern, as he's prone to fumbles due to poor ball carrying technique.  His blocking needs refinement, showing lapses in effort and technique, particularly in pass protection.\n\n**Opportunities:** Knighton's athleticism and potential provide opportunities for growth.  With coaching and development, he could improve his vision, decision-making, and pass protection, transforming him into a more well-rounded back.  His special teams ability could also provide a path to an NFL roster.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The profile doesn't offer a direct NFL comparison, but his skillset and weaknesses suggest a player who might develop similarly to a late-round pick or undrafted free agent who excels in certain situations but needs significant coaching and refinement to be a consistent contributor. He might eventually resemble a player like a faster, less powerful version of a  Jamaal Williams (emphasis on receiving and short-yardage), but with greater development needed.  However, his current inconsistency would likely place him below that level initially.\n"

He finds the appropriate \ncutback or bounce but can press deeper than 2-3 steps from his blockers.  \nWhen pressing individual blocks, Porter can press deeper before veering to one side. He tips off is intentions in these \nscenarios. This includes runs between the tackles and runs heading off-tackle.  \nHe identifies penetration into the backfield from slanting defenders and has a solution to avoid them.  \nPorter sets up pullers on gap plays.  \nIn the open field, Porter tries to jump cut across the face of pursuit over the top of him when continuing downhill at the \nangle he had would have been generate more yardage and increased his chances of breaking or avoiding a tackle.  \nElusiveness: Porter adjusts his stride length to set up his blocks. He runs with a wiggle.  \nPorter flips his hips efficiently and it sets up quick bounces outside. He has a quick jump cut that gets him away from \nslanting penetration in the backfield.  \nHe combines a spin with a stiff-arm to work past pursuit over the top of him from the outside.  \nPorter needs two quick steps to transition from an east-west track to a north-south track when in the open field.  \nAcceleration: Porter has notable acceleration to begin runs. He can turn the corner on a backside linebacker just long \nenough to move the chains on a run to the near sideline.  \nSpeed: He can hold off a safety at the same side of the field when he earns momentum to generate his top speed.  \nPower: Porter drops his pads into impending collisions and keeps his feet moving. Porter will drag an edge defender \ndownhill when wrapped at the line of scrimmage. Porter pulls through reaches of defensive tackles. He drops his pads and \nsplits defenders. \nThe location of his stiff arms can be more accurate. When he earns good location, he can ward off wraps long enough to \nearn positive yardage. \nDirect Contact Balance: Porter will stalemate a linebacker at the entrance of a crease.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Porter bounces off glancing shots to his pads from linebackers in open space and defensive \ntackles in the box.  \nRoutes: Porter uses a shed at the top of stems to counter the hands of defenders covering him on vertical routes.  \nWhen working to the flat where a defender is blitzing from, Porter waits until he clears that defender before turning his eyes \nto the quarterback.  \nReceiving: Porter can catch belt-high targets with underhand attack and his arms away from his frame. He keeps his feet \non the ground and he obeys the direction of the target when transition downhill with catch and pierce technique. He makes \none-handed stabs with underhand position and with the arm outstretched.  \n\n \n201 \nPorter tracks the ball over his shoulder, earns the ball wide of his frame and can use the appropriate attack based on the \ntrajectory of the ball.  \nPorter high-points effectively and he adheres to effective catch-and-pierce principles when transitioning downhill. He can \ntake a hit to his chest and/or side after a high-point as he makes the catch-and-pierce move. He obeys the direction of the \nball. He can win targets after getting ping-ponged by a linebacker and defensive tackle, both hitting him in the chest.  \nBlocking: Porter diagnoses interior pressure. He squares oncoming A-Gap blitzes deep in the pocket with a wide stance and \nhis knees bent. He strikes with his hands. His elbows are bent and his hands are tight enough for him to aim for the \ndefender’s breastplate.  \nPorter rolls through his hips as he delivers an uppercut strike. He stands up linebackers with his technique. He has lapses \nwhere he overextends against linebackers, and this leads to the defender winning quickly after the initial contact.  \nPorter has additional lapses with his strikes, his hands are too wide and he hugs rather than hits.  \nWhen assigned to cut block A-Gap pressure, Porter earns good depth into the pocket, but he tips off his intentions because \nhe overextends. When he times his efforts appropriately, he can avoid this issue and had done so with straight dives \nthrough the legs of opponents. In these cases, he shoots through the target and across (or straight onto) the frame of the \nopponent with good timing.

He takes contact to the \nball-carrying arm and maintains possession. His elbow can be tighter to his side.  \nHe has 3 fumbles in 508 touches – 1 per 169.3 touches.  \nDurability: Hand and shoulder injuries in high school – minor in nature.

        "analysis": "Cam Porter: Northwestern RB\n\n**Summary:** Cam Porter is a developmental running back prospect with a blend of power and elusiveness but needs refinement in several areas to reach his full potential at the NFL level. His vision and ability to identify and exploit defensive weaknesses are notable strengths, but inconsistent technique and decision-making hinder his overall effectiveness.  His receiving skills and pass blocking are promising areas, but require further development.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision & Elusiveness:** Porter demonstrates good vision, reading leverage and finding cutback lanes effectively. He possesses a wiggle and efficient hip flip, allowing him to make quick, decisive cuts.  He shows the ability to avoid tackles with a spin move combined with a stiff arm.\n* **Power:**  He runs with good power, consistently lowering his pads to initiate contact and drag defenders. He displays strength in pulling through tackles and breaking through arm tackles.\n* **Receiving:**  Porter is a capable receiver, showing the ability to catch the ball effectively with both hands, high-point passes, and transition smoothly into yards after the catch. He exhibits good body control and ball tracking skills.\n* **Pass Blocking:** Shows promise in pass protection with his ability to diagnose interior pressure and adequately engage blockers.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Inconsistency:** Porter's technique is inconsistent. He sometimes presses too deep before cutting, tips off his intentions, and takes too many steps to transition between directions in the open field.  His stiff arm placement, blocking strikes, and cut block execution need refinement to maximize effectiveness.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumble rate is relatively low, maintaining a tighter grip on the ball could improve.\n* **Acceleration/Top Speed:** Though he possesses notable acceleration initially, his top-end speed might not be elite.\n* **Injury History:**  A knee injury cost him a season, raising some durability concerns.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  No direct comparison is provided in the profile, but based on his skill set, a potential comparison could be a less explosive but more powerful version of a back like  **James Conner** (Pittsburgh Steelers), emphasizing his power running style and receiving ability.  Another, less polished comparison might be a younger, less refined **David Montgomery** (Chicago Bears) before his development into a more complete player.  However, these are broad comparisons, and Porter's ultimate NFL role and success will depend on his development and refinement.\n"

        "analysis": "Rodrigues Clark is a developmental running back prospect with a promising skillset but some areas needing improvement.  His RSP ranking of RB52 reflects his potential rather than current readiness.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Elusiveness & Vision:** Clark displays excellent vision, identifying creases and cutback lanes effectively. His curvilinear movement and ability to make sharp pressure cuts allow him to avoid tackles. He shows patience in setting up plays and adjusting to the flow of the game.\n* **Receiving:**  He's a capable receiver, showing good hand-eye coordination, tracking skills, and the ability to extend for catches. He attacks the ball aggressively and secures it effectively.\n* **Blocking:**  Clark demonstrates a willingness and some ability to block, showing proper technique and the capacity to engage defenders effectively.\n* **Ball Security:** His fumble rate is exceptionally low (1 per 121.25 touches), suggesting he's capable of protecting the football.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Speed & Acceleration:** While his acceleration through creases is noteworthy, his overall speed is described as \"reserve-level,\" indicating a need for improvement to excel at the NFL level.\n* **Power:** While he has a decent stiff-arm, his overall power needs development to consistently break tackles against bigger NFL defenders.\n* **Overall Athleticism:** His Depth of Talent Score (62.6) places him firmly in the developmental category, suggesting he'll need significant time to hone his skills.\n* **Lack of Game Film:** The limited number of games tracked limits the evaluation of his consistency and overall performance.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  The report doesn't provide a direct comparison, but based on his strengths and weaknesses, Clark could be compared to a late-round pick or undrafted free agent running back with good receiving skills and elusiveness but needing to add more power and speed to be a consistent contributor.  Players like Boston Scott (Philadelphia Eagles) or J.D. McKissic (Washington Commanders) - known for their receiving skills and ability to find yardage in space - might provide a reasonable, though imperfect, comparison in terms of potential NFL role.  He's likely a player who will need to focus on special teams to earn a roster spot.\n"

He reads interior \npenetration and works away from it in the backfield.  \nTrayanum reads leverage and sets up cutbacks. He does this with zone and gap plays.  \nElusiveness: Trayanum can open his hips at the line of scrimmage to set up a bounce. His transition out of that bounce has \nrough footwork because he’s trying to jump cut out of that hip opening.  \nTrayanum adjusts his stride length to set up creases or avoid unblocked defenders.

He's adept at adjusting his stride and using his body to avoid tackles.  He possesses the ability to open his hips and bounce runs to the perimeter.\n* **Power and Balance:** He's a powerful runner, capable of winning collisions with linebackers and safeties, particularly in short-yardage situations.

He sets up lead blockers on gap plays so he can hit a clean hole. When in \nthe second and third level, Brown feels pursuit from the backside and veers away from it early.  \nBrown is patient working behind blockers who earn a push on a defender in the crease. Brown will press zone plays within a \nstep of his blocks and find the bounce or cutback.  \nHe goes for cutbacks in the crease when he should continue attacking downhill. He gets away with it against college \ndefenses, but it’s less likely in the NFL. Think Tank Bigsby.  \nBrown identifies interior penetration and finds solutions to avoid the first penetrator. Brown can make dramatic cutback \ndecisions that are unnecessary and damaging to the outcome of the play. He must be more patient with the play design and \nmanipulate defenders into combo blocks. Otherwise, he’s prone to cutting back into unblocked defenders.  \nElusiveness: When working east-west to the opposite guard, Brown can transition downhill with two steps. Brown adjusts \nhis stride length and pacing to set up pulling guards.  \nHe has sharp pressure cuts in the crease to avoid unblocked linebackers pursuing downhill. Brown has good stop-start \nquickness behind the line of scrimmage and moves quickly enough laterally to avoid defenders shedding blockers.  \nBrown has an effective stick and head fake combination to set up defenders. He opens his hips efficiently when behind the \nline of scrimmage to set up bounces.  \nAs a gap runner, Brown uses the double up to set up pullers at the line of scrimmage.  \nBrown has an effective inside or outside spin against reaches from box defenders near the line of scrimmage. Brown’s \ndouble-up is an effective move to set up edge containment so he can get downhill.  \nAcceleration: Brown has the acceleration to gain ground on a high safety while running to the far-side perimeter. He’ll \nforce a safety to dive for any contact and can turn the corner on a lot of safeties in this situation. He outruns box defenders \non perimeter plays to the far sideline.  \nSpeed: When Brown earns separation/position against defensive backs, he can sustain separation 60-70 yards. Neither \nsafeties nor cornerbacks can catch him.  \nPower: Brown runs with low pad level when splitting defenders between the tackles. He pulls through reaches of \nlinebackers.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Brown can stalemate a direct shot from a safety when he has downhill momentum. He can do the \nsame with a linebacker when the collision isn’t as intense because the linebacker isn’t moving fast.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: N/A \nRoutes: He settles into zone and creates a friendly target.  \n\n \n206 \nReceiving: Brown has strong hand-eye coordination. He can extend and catch a slant one-handed while shedding the \ncontact of tight coverage at his back hip.  \nBrown tracks targets over his shoulder on wheel/bullet routes. He uses overhand and underhand position based on the \ntrajectory of the target and keeps his feet on the ground unless the height of the target forces Brown to leave his feet.  \nBlocking: When helping with double teams, Brown closes the gap between himself and his opponent. His arms are bent at \nthe elbows and hands tight. He aims for the chest of the defender.  \nBrown earns a square and squat position and slides with a wide stance.  \nBrown also uses his forearms to strike rather than open hands with a punch. This forces him to overextend when he strikes.  \nHe must develop a punch. He takes contact and is often way too passive at the point of attack. He shields far more often \nthan he strikes. He will move his feet after contact against edge defenders.  \nBall Security: Brown carries the ball high to his chest. He uses the boundary-side arm. Brown swings the ball while running \nin the open field, and it causes the elbow to come loose from his side. Brown keeps the ball tight to his chest. He can take \ncontact to the ball.  \nBrown has 7 fumbles in his career in 634 touches – 1 per 90.57 touches. He had four fumbles in 2024.

        "analysis": "Antario Brown is a developmental running back prospect with a Tank Bigsby comparison.  His strengths lie in his vision, particularly identifying and avoiding penetration, and his elusiveness, showcasing sharp cuts and effective fakes. He possesses good acceleration and top-end speed, allowing him to outrun defensive backs on perimeter plays. Brown also displays power and balance, capable of stalemating tackles, and shows promising receiving skills with strong hands and good tracking ability.\n\nHowever, Brown needs improvement in several areas. His decision-making regarding cutbacks needs refinement, as he sometimes cuts back into defenders unnecessarily.  His blocking needs significant work, lacking a consistent punch and often being too passive.  While his ball security is generally good (1 fumble per 90 touches), a concerning spike in fumbles (4) occurred in 2024.\n\n**Opportunities:**  Brown's speed and receiving ability could make him a valuable asset on special teams initially, with the potential to develop into a rotational back or even a starting role if he addresses his weaknesses.  Improving his pass protection and decision-making would significantly increase his NFL value.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The Tank Bigsby comparison highlights Brown's power, vision, and elusiveness. However, Bigsby is a more polished runner, suggesting Brown needs development to reach a similar level.  A less optimistic comparison might be to a player who excels on special teams early in their career, but whose offensive contributions remain limited due to inconsistent decision-making.  His future role depends heavily on his improvement in pass protection and ball security.\n"

He must learn to manage the \ngame better. He’ll press a crease within 1-2 steps of his blockers to set up cutbacks. When there are clear leverage reads, \nwith space to access between the tackles, Williams reads it effectively.  \nWilliams is patient with Counter. He can be too quick with Power and doesn’t give his pullers time to fully set up the crease.  \nWilliams identifies potential penetration pre-snap. His solutions could be more efficient if he cut his stride length and made \nchanges of direction deeper into the backfield.  \nElusiveness: Williams has a juke in the open field to set up defenders over the top of him. He has an effective jump cut to \nslide away from penetration.  \nAcceleration: Williams has enough acceleration to beat some linebackers to either edge as well as up the middle.  \nSpeed: He can hold off a cornerback for about 15-20 yards.  \nPower: In the red zone between the tackles, Williams keeps his pads low and his feet moving against contact. He initiates \ncontact with defensive backs in the open field when finishing a run near the boundary.  \nWilliams also initiates contact against linebackers meeting him head-on in the crease. He uses a stiff-arm to ward off the \nforce off the contact, forcing the defender to slide down Williams’ frame and wrap.  \nWilliams can keep his feet when wrapped by high by box defenders.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He’ll stalemate a safety head-on with a collision that he initiates and has momentum into the \ncollision point. He’ll also stalemate linebackers in the same fashion.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Williams bounces off glancing shots to his chest and pads from safeties.  \nRoutes: Williams identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He also tempos his \nbreaks in the open zone on routes that demand a break across the field.  \nAs a vertical route runner facing off-coverage, Williams must do more to stem the route inside. He can counter a defender’s \nhands with a shed.  \nWilliams can drop his weight into hard breaks, but must learn to accelerate into the break at the top of the stem and \nexecute in this fashion so he can develop suddenness with the turn.  \nWilliams could develop into a decent route runner against man-to-man coverage if he delivered routes with pace changes to \nset up the quickness of his moves used to change direction.  \nReceiving: Williams extends with overhand position with targets at chest height. He tracks the ball over his shoulder on \nshallow routes. He extends above his head for the target and highpoints without leaving his feet as he tracks over his \nshoulder. He can take a hit to his back after high-pointing and securing the ball.  \n\n \n208 \nBlocking: When pass protecting the edge, he gets deep into the pocket and tight to his tackle’s outside shoulder. His \nstance is wide, his knees are bent, and he shuffles his feet effectively to move laterally. \nWhen attacking as a stand-up blocker, he will close the gap between himself and the chest of the oncoming defender. \nThere’s some overextension and he doesn’t use a strike with is hands although his hands are tight to the chest of the \nopponent.  \nWilliams overextends into his strikes and it allows defenders to follow up successfully. If he punched and rolled his hips \nwithout overextending, he could prevent defenders from quickly redirecting. If he can deliver a better punch where the \npower is from his base, he could become a reliable pass protector at the NFL level. Williams times his strikes well against \ndefenders his size and smaller, but the overextension doesn’t allow him to sustain contact.  \nWhen chipping as part of a double-team, Williams loads up the elbow with a dip of the pads (an overextension), and \ndelivers an uppercut with the elbow and or shoulder into the chest of the opponent. The violence of his strikes has knocked \ndefenders off the primary blocker and unintentionally disrupted the protection plan.  \nHe identifies A-Gap pressure. When cut-blocking interior pressure, Williams keeps his head and eyes up and displays good \ntiming. He also delivers his cut with appropriate height. He doesn’t work across the opponent or shoot through the \nopponent—he leans and falls into the pressure and that makes the strike ineffective and easy to navigate through.  \nWhen cut blocking safety blitzes off the edge or defensive ends, he shoots through the target even if he doesn’t get fully \nacross the defender’s legs.  \nHe can miss delayed safety blitzes. He picks up cross blitzes with at least a chip. \nIn the open field, Williams transitions effectively from receiver to blocker.  \nBall Security: 396 touches and 0 fumbles. Williams carries the ball high to his chest and uses his boundary-side arm. He \ncovers the ball with both arms in traffic when working downhill between the tackles. When working the perimeter and open \nfield, he’s prone to swinging the ball.  \nDurability: Late-season knee injury in 2022-23 that took a few months of rehab and limited his spring camp.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Williams from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSophomore Highlights \n• \nJunior Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n209",

He uses a stick to set up defenders.  \nBehind the line of scrimmage on gap plays, Bennett will use stride length changes and pace changes to set up creases.  \nAcceleration: Bennett has the acceleration to work outside box defenders to the far-side edge.  \nSpeed: Linebackers can chase down Bennett in the open field.  \nPower: Bennett keeps his feet moving when a linebacker wraps him high at the entrance of a crease. He’ll get his pads \nunder the contact so he can cultivate a lean forward as he faces the contact. Bennett will also initiate contact in the crease \nwith his low pad level.  \nBennett has a stiff-arm but he’s prone to delivering it like a punch with a long wind-up rather than extending into the \nopponent and driving with his legs. This leads to him missing contact.  \nWhen Bennett delivers the stiff-arm accurately, he can ward off reaches to his frame and force a linebacker to slide down to \nBennett’s legs.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Bennett can win collisions with a downhill runway into a linebacker.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can take hard shots to his frame from defensive backs.  \nRoutes: Bennett identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When he’s breaking \nacross the field against zone coverage, he can get crossed up on whether to settle or tempo his break.  \nAgainst man coverage, Bennett will stem coverage outside on vertical routes and break downfield into the back of the \ndefender. He’s adept at stemming linebackers and safeties. He uses a wipe to counter the hands of a defender.  \nReceiving: Bennett tracks the ball over his shoulder and uses underhand position to attack while running away from the \ntarget. He extends his arms away from his frame on vertical routes to win underhand position.  \n\n \n210 \nHe attacks the ball with overhand position when facing the target. He’ll extend first for targets over his head before leaving \nhis feet and can high-point without leaving his feet.  \nBennett will take contact to his back to earn the ball.  \nBlocking: Bennett identifies interior pressure and squares the assignment with depth in the pocket. He’ll hook a linebacker \nand run his feet to move the defender away from the quarterback.  \nWhen working against interior pressure, he’s prone to overextending and absorbing contact rather than dictating contact. \nWhen he delivers a shot, he’s overextending but can generate enough force to push a linebacker with a downhill runway \naway from the quarterback.  \nBennett will chip-release to the flat. His attempts to chip can be off-balanced and lead to him slipping as he gets into his \nroute. \nBennett has a timely cut block against interior blitzes. He keeps his eyes up.  \nBall Security: Bennett carries the ball under his boundary arm and close to his chest. He has lapses where he bounces \nplays outside and keeps the ball under the arm away from the boundary. He keeps his elbow tight to his side. He can take \ncontact to the ball-carrying arm but his track record with fumbles is bad.  \nBennett has 10 fumbles in 403 career touches – 1 per 40.3 touches.  \nDurability: Missed first nine games with an upper-body injury in 2022.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Bennett from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nCutback TD and Over the head tracking \n• \nStick and spin \n• \nCoastal Carolina vs. Appalachian State Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n211",
        "analysis": "Braydon Bennett is a 6'2\", 215-pound running back from Coastal Carolina with a Depth of Talent Score of 56.7, placing him in the \"street\" category (special teams, end of bench, practice squad).  While possessing some intriguing physical tools, his overall refinement needs significant work.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Power:** Bennett displays good power, especially when hitting a crease downhill. He can win collisions with linebackers and maintain balance through contact. He also possesses a strong stiff-arm when delivered correctly.\n* **Receiving:** He shows decent receiving skills, capable of tracking the ball over his shoulder and adjusting to different target positions.  He's able to high-point the ball and take contact to secure the catch.\n* **Blocking:** He demonstrates the ability to identify and effectively block interior pressure, particularly with cut blocks.  He can hook and move linebackers away from the quarterback.\n* **Elusiveness:** He possesses some elusiveness, using spins and stride changes to create space, although consistency is lacking. He can make sharp cuts in tight spaces.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Vision/Decision-Making:** His vision needs significant improvement, particularly in reacting to interior penetration. His tendency to make inefficient jump stops hinders his effectiveness.\n* **Ball Security:**  His fumble rate (1 per 40.3 touches) is a major concern. He needs to improve his ball carrying technique and consistency.\n* **Acceleration/Speed:** While possessing acceleration to get to the edge, his top-end speed is limited, making him susceptible to being caught by faster linebackers.\n* **Refinement of Techniques:**  His stiff-arm, spin move, and blocking techniques are inconsistent and require refinement for better efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report mentions early-career Kenyan Drake regarding his jump stops.  However, this comparison is only in a negative context, highlighting a weakness rather than an overall comparison.  No overall strong NFL comparison is given, suggesting Bennett is a project with significant potential for improvement but lacking a clear prototype.  He's a player with traits that could be developed, but needs a significant amount of coaching to reach an NFL level.\n"

Cooley is patient with \npullers, adjusting his stride length and pace. He’ll press the puller long enough to draw in pursuit and access cutbacks in the \nopen field. If he spots a cutback on gap plays between the tackles, he’ll take it.  \nCooley identifies and avoids interior penetration. Cooley presses within a step of his double team on inside zone and finds \nthe cutback or bounce lane.  \nElusiveness: Cooley has enough range with a jump cut or a jump stop in tight space to avoid a penetrating defensive \ntackle in the backfield. Cooley needs two pairs of skip steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill approach \non a run to the near-side flat.  \nCooley uses a spin when wrapped or a defender reaches for his frame. He’ll alter his stride length and pacing to set up \ncreases.  \nAcceleration: Missouri’s defensive tackle repeatedly caught Cooley from behind within the first 10 yards of the line of \nscrimmage after Cooley had a downhill hole he could accelerate through unfettered. Even with an option play to the near-\nside flat, he can’t turn the corner on a linebacker.  \nCooley is routinely caught by the backside pursuit of a linebacker before he passes the line of scrimmage. He lacks the \nshort-area quickness to pivot inside-out and square a safety or an edge linebacker as a pass protector.  \nSpeed: When he reaches full speed in open space he can hold off a cornerback’s pursuit for 30-40 yards.  \nPower: Cooley keeps his feet moving when wrapped high. He attacks oncoming defenders with the pad that isn’t on the \nside where he’s carrying the ball. He pulls through reaches to his pads from trailing box defenders.  \nCooley uses the stiff arm when in the open field and has good placement. He can force a linebacker to slide down his frame \nto make the tackle.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can stalemate a linebacker at the entrance of a hole and remain on his feet as help arrives to \ngenerate a push. He’ll stalemate a defensive tackle at the entrance of a hole and force the defender to wrap.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He’ll initiate with his pads against safeties and knock them to the turf. Cooley has a capable \nbalance-touch. He’ll win collisions at the exit of a hole against a linebacker waiting on him. He’ll also split glancing shots \nfrom defensive backs at either side of his frame.  \nRoutes: Cooley identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He creates a friendly \ntarget for his quarterback.  \nReceiving: Cooley extends well for the football above his head. He tracks the ball over his shoulder and attacks it with \noverhand position. He also tracks it with underhand position at the beltline. He also tracks targets above his head without \nleaving his feet.  \nCooley also extends well away from his frame with the direction of the break to catch targets high and wide of him without \nleaving his feet to do so.  \n\n \n212 \nBlocking: Cooley can work inside-out against edge pressure. He’ll square defenders with his knees bent. When an outside \nlinebacker beats him to the punch, he’s still stout enough to stay with the defender even while pushed back.  \nIn 2022, Cooley would miss an outside linebacker twisting inside and give up a sack that was his responsibility. He was \nmore effective against linebackers twisting to the outside and picking them.  \nAs a lead blocker, Cooley earns a tight position but punches with his forearms and this limits his potential to sustain contact.  \nHe gets beaten with fakes to the outside and allows defenders inside as an edge protector against defensive backs and edge \nlinebackers.  \nBall Security: 533 touches with 5 fumbles—all 5 from past two years – 1 per 106.6 \nCooley carries the ball high to his chest but the elbow is loose from his frame. He carries the ball under the boundary-side \narm as a runner.

        "analysis": "Quinton Cooley is a running back prospect with a unique blend of strengths and weaknesses.  His profile suggests a player who could contribute on special teams and potentially develop into a late-round NFL pick or practice squad player.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Patience:** Cooley excels at identifying creases and patiently waiting for blocks to develop, allowing him to find cutback lanes effectively. He shows good awareness of interior penetration.\n* **Power and Contact Balance:** He demonstrates impressive power, maintaining balance even when engaged with multiple defenders. He effectively uses stiff arms and maintains his feet to break tackles.  He wins collisions against linebackers and safeties.\n* **Receiving Ability:** Cooley is a capable receiver, showing good hand-eye coordination, body positioning, and the ability to extend for catches both high and low.\n* **Open-Field Speed:**  Once he reaches full speed, Cooley can outrun cornerbacks for a considerable distance.\n* **Pass Blocking (Situational):** Shows promise blocking against inside-linebackers twisting outside.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improve Acceleration and Short-Area Quickness:** His acceleration is a significant weakness, hindering his ability to consistently gain yards after contact and escape defenders in tight spaces.  Improving this area could drastically improve his draft stock.\n* **Refine Blocking Technique:**  While he shows some strength in pass protection, his inconsistent hand placement and tendency to get beaten by fakes limit his overall effectiveness as a blocker.  Improving his technique would make him a more valuable asset.\n* **Ball Security:** While his fumble rate isn't alarmingly high (1 per 106.6 touches), improving his ball-carrying technique (currently carries the ball loosely) is crucial to minimize turnovers.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Elite Speed and Acceleration:** Consistently gets caught from behind by quicker defenders, especially in short-yardage situations.\n* **Pass Protection Consistency:**  Susceptible to getting beaten by quick outside linebackers who twist inside.\n* **Blocking Technique:** Needs refinement to become a consistently reliable blocker in pass protection and as a lead blocker.\n* **Durability Concerns:**  A history of undisclosed injuries raises questions about his long-term health and availability.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  The provided profile does not offer a specific NFL comparison, likely due to his unique blend of strengths and weaknesses and the fact he's a lower-ranked prospect.  His skillset might remind scouts of a smaller, more powerful back who is primarily a change-of-pace option or special teams contributor, but without the elite speed and agility to be an every-down player.  Think a less-athletic version of a player like  James Conner (in terms of power and receiving ability, but lacking Conner's overall speed and athleticism).  A more appropriate comparison might be a player like  Boston Scott,  who has carved a niche in the league based on his short-yardage prowess and special teams contributions.  However, Cooley needs significant improvement to reach even that level.\n"

He sets up outside creases with initial presses inside within a \nstep or two of the nearest defender.  \nSimmons hits creases decisively and will attack tight creases on zone plays in short-yardage with no hesitation.  \nSimmons identifies edge penetration and can make efficient moves to avoid it.  \nElusiveness: Simmons has a tight spin in the open field. He uses small stride adjustments to set up creases and small \ncutbacks at the line of scrimmage. He favors the double-up to set up the cutback as he’s adjusting his stride length and \npace to set up the crease.  \nSimmons only needs two small steps to transition downhill when working toward tackle.  \nAcceleration: Simmons has enough acceleration to beat linebackers on a lot of designed plays.  \nSpeed: Simmons has the long speed to maintain separation against defensive backs on runs up the middle that veer to the \nnear-side boundary.  \nPower: When Simmons has 15-20 yards of downhill momentum, he’ll run through lower-body reaches from safeties.

Henry \nanticipates lead blockers reaching their assignments and hits a crease decisively.  \nHenry identifies cutback opportunities on gap plays when the designed hole is close. He also spots cutback opportunities on \nzone runs.  \nHenry also identifies interior penetration during the exchange and can take efficient action to avoid it.  \nAs a perimeter runner, Henry will press an inside crease before taking the outside crease. I need to see him deeper than 3-\n4 steps from blockers or defenders.  \nElusiveness: Henry is an effective one-cut runner who gets downhill fast. He varies his stride length and pace to set up \npullers and double teams.  \nHenry can execute wide pressure cuts in the open field to dip around pursuit over the top of him. He has an effective spin to \nwork through contact to his frame.  \nWhen in the backfield, Henry can use an efficient jump cut to sidestep interior penetration and find the hole behind it.  \nHenry needs 3-4 steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a downhill path. Henry has an effective double-up to set \nup the opening of his hips as he presses the line of scrimmage and then bounces the play outside.  \nHe has good stop-start movement in the backfield to dip away from interior penetration.  \nAcceleration: Henry has the acceleration to work past box defenders and reach the secondary. If a defensive back climbs \ntoo early into the box, Henry can accelerate past them and maintain separation to flip the field.  \nSpeed: Henry can pull away from defensive backs when he earns early separation into the secondary.  \nPower: Henry works between the tackles with low pad level. His pad level needs correction because he dips his head into \ncontact. For his safety, he needs to keep his eyes up as he’s making contact with his pads.  \nHe keeps his feet moving when a defender wraps him high. He’s not a pile pusher. He can drag a defender wrapping him \nhigh for 1-2 yards.  \nHenry combines a stiff arm and a spin to work through reaches and wraps to his pads.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: A glancing shot to his side from a safety can knock Henry to the ground. Henry can bounce off \nan indirect shot from a cornerback after he has built momentum. He’ll bounce off a safety who he has momentum into the \ncollision and the safety is flat-footed. He’ll turn his back into the hit and spin off.  \nRoutes: Henry identifies the second-level defender in zone. He may get too much depth with certain routes or not break far \nenough away from the defender with the depth that he earns. He can be quicker with his turn.  \n\n \n218 \nReceiving: Henry can track the ball over his shoulder and use overhand attack at the earliest point of arrival to earn the \nball.  \nBlocking: Henry identifies edge pressure, earns depth in the pocket to set up, and sets up with a square and squat stance. \nHowever, he must learn to shuffle his feet with a wide stance. He’s prone to running with his hips turned in the direction \nhe’s running rather than shuffling. This allows defenders to redirect and force Henry to overrun his pursuit.  \nHenry extends his arms with his elbows bent and aims for the breast plate of the defender. As a lead blocker, Henry delivers \na punch, but overextends into the contact. This leads to a one-hit-and-done scenario where he cannot sustain the block. \nThe hit can be hard enough to knock the defender out of position from the runner.  \nHenry can win against a linebacker pressuring the edge when he’s square to the target and the defender allows Henry to \noverextend head-first into the defender’s chest. He’ll take contact rather than initiate it. His head can dip at a dangerous \nangle that could get him hurt.  \nWhen he takes contact from a square position with his head up, he can remain in position against an off-ball linebacker. Any \ndefender larger than a small off-ball linebacker will generate a push on Henry into the quarterback’s lap. \nHenry diagnoses interior and edge pressure.  \nHis lead blocks are better than his pass protection. He can work to the correct shoulder of a box defender and turn him \ninside or outside based on the design of the run. He sustains better as a run blocker.  \nBall Security: Henry carries the ball high to his chest but allows the ball to get loose form his chest and side. He uses the \nboundary-side arm to carry the ball.  \nHenry has 288 touches with 5 fumbles—a rate of 1 per 57.6. He has kept the ball tighter to his chest in 2023 while running \nin the open field versus what he was doing in 2022. There are still lapses with swinging the ball. He can take some contact \nto the ball when it is heigh enough to his chest.  \nDurability: Played 23 games at ULM. Covid Year gave him a Super Senior Season. Missed all but three games due to a \npreseason injury in 2023.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Henry from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBounce, indirect balance  \n• \nPerimeter run, press, better ball security than 2022 \n• \nHighlights 2021-2023 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n219",
        "analysis": "Andrew Henry is a developmental running back prospect with a mix of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Vision and Elusiveness:** Henry displays good vision, identifying cutback lanes effectively both between the tackles and on zone runs. He's a decisive one-cut runner with the ability to use effective jump cuts and spins to evade tacklers. He shows promise in the open field, utilizing wide pressure cuts and a double-up move to create separation.\n* **Acceleration and Speed:** Henry possesses the acceleration to outrun box defenders and reach the secondary.  He can pull away from defensive backs if he gains early separation.\n* **Power (with caveats):**  He runs with low pad level (though this needs correction for safety), and can drag defenders for a short distance. He effectively combines stiff arms and spins to break tackles.\n* **Receiving Ability:**  Henry shows the ability to track the ball over his shoulder and secure catches.\n* **Pass Blocking (Improving):** He demonstrates awareness of pressure and attempts to set up properly, though his technique needs refinement.  His run blocking is better developed than pass protection.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Technique:**  Several areas need refinement: maintaining high pad level to avoid head-down contact, improving his footwork in pass protection (shuffling instead of running with hips turned), and securing the ball more consistently.  He also needs to improve consistency in his route running and extend his perimeter runs beyond 3-4 steps.\n* **Durability:**  A significant preseason injury limited his playing time in 2023, raising concerns about his durability.  \n* **Overall Consistency:**  While showing flashes of high-level ability, he needs to display more consistency in all aspects of his game.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The report doesn't offer a direct comparison, indicating he's a relatively unproven prospect.  His skillset suggests a potential comparison to a smaller, more elusive back who needs to refine their technique to reach their full potential – possibly a player like a less-powerful version of a  **James Conner** (strong runner, but needs to improve pass blocking) or a more refined **Elijah Holyfield**.  However, this is highly speculative given the lack of a direct comparison in the report and his developmental status.\n"

        "text": "RSP Ranking: RB61 \nJersey: No.28 \nHeight/Weight: 5’10”/201 School: Eastern Michigan \nComparison Spectrum: N/A \n \nDepth of Talent Score: 48 = Street: Developmental talents with deficits in experience, technique, or athletic ability. \n \nGames Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): \n• \nUMass ‘24 \n• \nWashington ‘24 \n• \nToledo ‘23 \n \nVision: McMillan misreads leverage on inside zone and veers away from the double team when he should know that double \nteam could split open, and he should be anticipating it based on the defensive alignment pre-snap. He veers into defenders \nwith advantageous leverage and away from the play design.  \nWhen McMillan reads the leverage correctly, he’ll attack tight creases—even leaping toward them as they close to attempt \nto get what he can from it.  \nMcMillan identifies penetration into the backfield and works away from it. He adjusts his stride well when setting up wind \nback blocks.  \nMcMillan misses cutback opportunities on perimeter runs. He also doesn’t press the perimeter run inside to give his outside \nblockers a chance to earn position on edge defenders.  \nElusiveness: McMillan adjusts stride length during the exchange to set up blockers between the tackles. McMillan has a \nhabit of stumbling from jukes because he gets his feet too far outside his frame. He also stumbles when bouncing outside \nbecause his plant foot is too far inside his frame, and he topples over after he plants.  \nMcMillan can spin away from defenders in tight confines. His hip mobility can be better. He doesn’t point his toe 90 degrees \nto open his hips as efficiently as he should. He’s better at avoiding penetration with choppy steps, but he crosses his feet \nwhen making these steps and puts himself in danger of tripping over his feet.  \nAcceleration: McMillan can beat a box defender around the short edge and up the boundary. He can beat some safeties to \nthe corner. He’ll reach the secondary on a well-blocked run up the middle.  \nSpeed: McMillan can outrun some linebackers with strong angles, his speed is reserve-tier in quality.  \nPower: McMillan initiates contact with his pads against defensive backs in the open field when finishing a play near the \nboundary. When wrapped above the waist, McMillan can keep his feet moving to extend for additional yardage.  \nMcMillan’s pad level is good enough to pull through linebackers’ reaches to his frame. He uses his stiff-arm effectively in \nclose quarters to ward off reaches to his frame.  \nMcMillan gets his feet high enough to avoid low shots/reaches from defenders. McMillan can work through multiple tackle \nattempts in the open field against defensive backs – even at the Pac-10/Big-10 level.  \nDirect Contact Balance: McMillan can bounce off direct hits from safeties in the open field.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: McMillan works through glancing shots to his pads from safeties.  \nRoutes: When facing man-to-man coverage, McMillan adjusts his break once he sees the quarterback break the pocket and \nruns off the defender to eliminate potential defensive pursuit.  \nReceiving: McMillan tracks targets below his waist effectively. He extends his arms with underhand position to catch the \nball away from his frame. He can take a wrap to his back as he extends for targets at or slightly below waist level.  \nMcMillan is skilled turning away from his break path to catch targets at his numbers and waist.  \n\n \n220 \nBlocking: McMillan earns depth against A-Gap pressure, squares with a squat position, and delivers a double jab with a \nslight overextension. He can strike a little early. If he used an uppercut, he generates more power. His hands are tight and \naiming for the defender’s chest.   \nMcMillan moves his feet well after the initial strike of an assignment, following up effectively. McMillian moves well as a lead \nblocker on sprint passes, getting to the edge and attacking defensive backs.  \nMcMillan shuffles his feet well to move laterally. He’ll work inside-out as a pass protector, insuring he can help against \ninterior pressure before sliding to an unblocked outside defender. He can work across a pocket to square a DB blitz off the \nedge.  \nMcMillan can miss some delayed safety blitzes around the edge where his help is needed most. When chipping an edge \ndefender, he’ll attack with the outside shoulder against and edge defender which gives the defender room to work around \nhim and he should be attacking with the inside shoulder to wall off the opponent.  \nBall Security: McMillan tucks the ball under his right arm even when catching a target outside the left numbers and facing \npursuit that’s closest to his inside arm. On designed runs, McMillan will use his left hand when the exchange is forcing him \nto do so.  \nMcMillan carries the ball close to his chest, but it’s not tight to his chest because he swings the ball with his arm as he runs. \nThe elbow is also loose from his side.  \nMcMillan has 6 fumbles in 336 career touches between 2020-2024 – 1 per 56 touches.  \nDurability: Missed five games with undisclosed injury in 2024. Redshirted in 2019 and 2020 was a Covid Year.  \n \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor McMillan from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDontae McMillan 54-yard run \n• \nDontae McMillan: Weber State vs. Idaho State \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n221 \nRB Rankings Table (Top 61) \nNote: Times and measurements are from the NFL Combine or in this case, Pro Day workouts as made available prior to \npublication.

In practice, this is a hit-or-miss process that, at the very least, is an entertaining \nexercise. Each “-“ is an approximate level of separation between one player’s talent and the next. A “/” between two names \nmeans those players have closely matched talents. The key word is “talent,” because there are some players with lesser \ncareers listed ahead of more famous or productive peers. This is my subjective interpretation of skill, not success. For \nexample, I have Ahmad Bradshaw ahead of D’Andre Swift on a spectrum of comparison for a runner on this list.

It is not an updated ranking, but \nrather, a look at how I would have seen these players from the same starting point as prospects without a team prior to the \ndraft. Think of the list as one solely about grading talent and not landing spot, scheme, or how the player performed in the \nNFL.  \n \nThe long-term, aspirational goal of this combined list will be to develop a workable score that has some value across draft \nclasses. Because the RSP’s process is built on continuous improvement, adjustments to the scoring criteria will make this \naspirational goal difficult to attain over the course of the next few years.  \n \nThe realistic goal of this combined list is entertainment value and a starting point for the reader to conduct research on his \nown that may prove helpful for fantasy leagues. Here are possible ways this list may help:  \n \n• \nA combined present and short-term historical perspective on the value of players and draft picks at the position. \n• \nPerspective on emerging, unproven, or declining players (helpful for formulating trade value). \n• \nA short-term historical perspective with physical and athletic measurements.  \n \nAn updated three-year ranking based on how I see these players heading into the 2025 season will be available in the \nRSP Post-Draft Publication.  \n \nNote: I suggest beginning your examination using tiers by Depth of Talent Score and demarcate the tiers by 10 points: \n \n• \nTier 1: 90-100 \n• \nTier 2: 80-89 \n• \nTier 3: 70-79 \n• \nTier 4: 60-69 \n \nFocus more on the range these players fall into rather than the linear order. Remember, players with a specific fit in a \nsystem may score lower than their actual potential of impact will indicate, which is why the RSP is implementing Scheme-\nBased analysis for additional perspective and clarity about prospects and their short-term and long-term potential. Players \nnames in bold would have Depth scores 2-10 points lower than they did at the time of publication. \n \nThose who wish to calculate these collegiate fumble rates for past players and make a more refined adjustment of the \ninformation can access the game logs for each player in question on Fox Sports (For example, Google “Ameer Abdullah \nNebraska Stats Fox Sports”). The site provides stats on fumbles and divides those career totals by total touches (runs, \nreceptions, and returns).  \n \nOnce determining the fumble rate, refer to the Ball Handling Tier in this chapter, and match the fumble rate to the \ncorresponding score. Then refer to the past the Ball Handling Tiers in previous publications to determine the difference in \npoints between the two for the necessary adjustments.  \n \nMost don’t care that much to find this information, but those who even care to ask will be motivated to do the work.  \n \n\n \n246 \nRank \nName \nSchool \nHt. \nWt. \nDepth \nBreadth \n3rd \n40 \n20S \n3C \nV \nB \nCommentary \nRB1 \nAshton Jeanty \nBoise State \n5'8\" \n211 \n92.9 \n93.25 \n89.3 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nA dynamic mover with \nexcellent vision, slippery \npower, and stamina to \nfinish with a play downfield \nwith similar energy he had \nto begin it.  \nRB2 \nBijan Robinson \nTexas \n5'11\" \n215 \n89.9 \n93.125 \n87.9 \n4.46 \nN/A \nN/A \n37 \nN/A \nThe headliner of a strong \nRB class, Robinson's most \nimpressive trait might be \nhis work ethic. \nRB3 \nQuinshon Judkins \nOle Miss/Ohio State \n5'11\" \n221 \n89 \n93 \n83 \n4.48 \nN/A \nN/A \n38.5 \nN/A \nJudkins' dimensions, \ndecision-making, explosion, \ncontact balance, and power \nhit all the sweet spots for \nbell-cow RB.  \nRB4 \nTahj Brooks \nTexas Tech \n5'9\" \n214 \n89 \n92.25 \n86 \n4.52 \n4.06 \n6.9 \n35 \nN/A \nI was bullish on Gore and \nBell way back when, and \nBrooks reminds me of \nthem.

        "analysis": "**Dontae McMillan**\n\n* **Strengths:** McMillan possesses a willingness to attack tight creases, even leaping for them. He shows an ability to identify and avoid penetration into the backfield, adjusting his stride well for wind back blocks. He can effectively stiff-arm in close quarters and keep his feet moving to extend plays after initial contact.  He's also shown the ability to adjust his routes based on quarterback movement and is skilled at tracking targets below his waist.  His blocking, particularly in pass protection, displays solid footwork and ability to move laterally, though consistency needs improvement.\n\n* **Opportunities:** McMillan needs significant improvement in reading leverage on inside zone runs and anticipating double teams. His elusiveness is hampered by stumbling due to poor foot placement during jukes and outside bounces. He misses cutback opportunities and doesn't press perimeter runs inside enough to aid his blockers.  His hip mobility could be better, leading to less efficient breaks. He also struggles with delayed safety blitzes.  While his ball security isn't terrible (1 fumble per 56 touches), it could be tighter. His durability is also a concern given his missed games in 2024.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** The report doesn't provide a direct NFL comparison, likely due to his lower ranking and developmental status.  His skillset, however, suggests a potential role as a short-yardage/goal-line back, similar to a player like *Jaylen Warren*  but without the proven receiving skills.   Given his need for development, a comparison to an undrafted free agent who eventually found a niche role might be more appropriate.\n"
