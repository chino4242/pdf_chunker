Drew Lock and Zach Wilson earned these comparisons as well.  \n \nIt’s a superficial comparison. Ward’s game is closer in style to Mahomes’ trailer-park cousin, Johnny Manziel, except Ward’s game won’t be \nfound on Trailer Park Boys TV.  \n \nWard’s game lives in one of few the apartment complexes in that high-end, suburban neighborhood. You know the type: Where the schools \nare good, and daddies offer to buy brand-new SUVs for their daughters as a bribe for taking the in-state government academic scholarship \nto a public school while steering clear of the expensive, out-of-state program. \n \nWard’s game has seen the refined way of life through most of his friends, but he lives in the neighborhood with divorcees, cranky old people \nwhose families got as far away from them as possible (often for good reason), and the kids who grow up there are considered the high-risk \nchildren at the school.  \n \nWard is an off-script, playground creator with enough technical and conceptual skills to develop into a prominent NFL starter. Miami and \nWashington State used Ward in systems that delivered a lot of quick-hitting RPOs and screens in the short passing game and resorted to \nfour verticals – four receivers running go routes – and letting Ward buy time to find an open man.  \n \nWard has become at finding creative ways to get the ball out of his hand on quick-hitting plays and buying time and space on the long-\ndeveloping plays to help a target work open when forced off-script. It’s the points in between these two extremes of offense where Ward \nhas shown enough to promise to become a productive NFL quarterback.  \n \nThis will depend on how well a team does to set the stage for Ward’s development and/or if Ward can survive the potential onslaught that \nusually happens with rookies in the NFL.  \n \nAs good as Ward can be off-script, he must tighten up his drop footwork, set ups, and his releases. Most of the work that’s necessary is with \nhis lower body.  \n \nSome teams may believe Ward’s arm mechanics require the most tinkering, but I would caution coaches to be careful about messing with it. \nWard has a whip-like motion that’s quick, generates velocity, and his accuracy issues have more to do with his feet than his arm.  \n \nWard has the arm talent to start in the NFL. He can make most, if not all, of the throws from the pocket that NFL coaches want in their \noffense and use a variety of throwing platforms to do so.  \n \nWard manipulates defenders with well-executed ball fakes in the play-action game as well as pump fakes in and outside the pocket. The \nplay-action game is where Ward exhibited the most cohesive and fluid aspects of drop footwork.  \n \nWhen dropping from pistol and shotgun, Ward’s footwork is fragmented in pacing and fluidity of steps. It doesn’t look good, but it hasn’t \nkilled his timing thus far. While that might prove the case when Ward transitions to the NFL, it’s likely that he’ll need to refine his footwork.  \n \nIf Ward doesn’t display clean, organized, and fluid drop footwork in game action this summer, it may be a compelling enough reason to \nkeep Ward on the bench and give him time to develop the technique that will be the foundation for everything he does as a decision-maker \nand thrower in the passing game. Last year, Caleb Williams struggled for half of the season with the Bears because drop footwork was \namong the problems with this offense. There were plays where the Bears’ former offensive coordinator didn’t have prescribed footwork for \nthe drop and Williams’ timing was off with his receivers.  \n \nWilliams had better drop footwork coming out of school than Ward’s appears at this point. When coverage is as tight as it can be in the NFL \nand pressure reaches the pocket earlier, a quarterback must be efficient and precise. Sloppy footwork doesn’t create a foundation for \nefficient and precise play.  \n \nWard’s decision-making has high points. From a clean pocket, he can split defenders with downfield throws based on good reads of \nleverage. He can deliver with touch, velocity, and throw the moon ball in the deep game so his receivers can win targets with their athletic \nability.  \n \nWard is often aware of defenders in the periphery of his intended targets and knows when that defender is in too good of position for Ward \nto target the route. He has lapses with this awareness and it unfortunately happens in the most compressed region of the field where the \nmistakes have more gravity – the red zone.  \n \nWard’s ability to buy time, layer targets over the defense, split coverage, and notice peripheral defenders raises his confidence in his ability \nto bleed every bit of opportunity from a play. When he exhausts his options, he’ll throw the ball away. However, he takes sizable risks \nbefore doing so – reversing field, backing away from pressure, and attempting across-the-body throws.  \n \n\n \n49 \nJust as Ward is prone to squeezing a ball into a receiver where the coverage is prohibitive in the red zone, Ward is prone to holding onto the \nball too long in the red and the black zone. Ward must learn his limits in these areas of the field and play a more mature brand of football.  \n \nThis may prove a big adjustment for Ward, because Miami and Washington State relied on him to be the central playmaker, and Ward had a \nlot of success doing it. He has excellent movement skills in and outside the pocket and he senses pressure as well as anyone in this class.  \n \nLike Manziel, Ward will enter the league believing that he can maintain his style of play and have success. Hey may tell everyone who asks \nthat he knows he’ll need to adjust. Most of the time, the response is a platitude that young people use when they have no idea how they’ll \nneed to adjust until they are experiencing the pain of their new environment.  \n \nUnlike Manziel, Ward isn’t a wild child off the field who had sudden success and relished the celebrity of his position more than the game. If \nManziel had a mature mindset and didn’t have as many knots to untie with his life, the ability to become a good NFL starter was there for \nthe taking.  \n \nManziel came from a wealthy family. His game was from the trailer park. His professionalism wandered into the trailers momma told you to \nsteer clear from.  \n \nWard has a chance to develop into a good player. If he can become a technically-sharp player with an expansive mind for processing NFL-\ncaliber information, his game could bear more of a resemblance to Joe Burrow’s.  \n \nIt doesn’t need to get there to be successful. A refined Manziel would be a compelling option.  \n \nTechnical: He tracks the ball effectively over his shoulder when used on trick plays as the receiver.  \nDrops: Ward has effective one- and two-step set ups from pistol. He also has three- and five-step drops that are precise but slow and can \nlook like they aren’t cohesive drops because the rate of movement is gradual. He has well-paced five- and seven-step drops with designed \nrolls that he gets the ball out on time.  \nWhile Ward can drop into a productive and balanced stance, his drops have a lot of bounce and variable widths that end with a wide stance \nthat he corrects. In a timing passing game, Ward must show that he can have consistent, quick, and precise drops that time up well with \nroutes. At Washington State, Ward had situational drops from center. His drop pace was more uniform under center. When in pistol or \nshotgun, Ward often didn’t take a step before he threw or his drops weren’t even as uniform as they were in Miami. .  \nWard is quick to pivot and set with RPOs and he gets the ball out fast in these scenarios. He’s also creative with his release to distribute \nthese targets accurately while under heavy pressure.  \nBall Security: Ward carries the ball high to his chest as a runner. In the pocket, he holds the ball with both hands. When breaking the \npocket, and working to his left, Ward doesn’t switch the ball to his boundary-side arm despite most of the pursuit coming from his right \nside.  \nHe can take contact to the ball when the strike comes from a defender over the top to the meat of the ball at Ward’s chest. When it’s from \nbackside pursuit and near the elbow, Ward is more vulnerable.  \nPlay Fakes: Ward sells the read fake effectively. The timing, the extension, and the duration are all strong. He even gets low through the \nexchange point. He can give a hint of the ball toward the runner on a five-step drop from center with a play fake where his back is turned to \nthe defense.  \nPump Fakes: Ward has a shoulder fake to manipulate the secondary. He also manipulates with a flash of the ball with minimal movement \nwhen holding a safety to one side of the field. He’ll use a small pitch or shovel-pass fake with one hand as he breaks the pocket to freeze \ndefenders over the top of him. Ward has a pump fake with partial motion and moderate violence.  \nRelease: Ward can deliver the ball with three-quarter motion while moving to his left. He has a side-arm motion with RPOs. Ward is \neffective throwing off his back foot in the shallow range of the field.  \nWard sets his feet quickly on RPOs and quick targets outside. The midline of his back foot and the toe of his front foot are aligned with the \ntarget. He bounces on his toes in his stance and when he slides a step laterally, his bouncing can creep into his throwing motion and that \ncan be disruptive.  \nEarlier in the season, I noticed with specific throws that Ward’s cleats didn’t stay in the ground as he’s throwing the ball. Keeping his cleats \nin the ground as he throws the ball can enhance his velocity and placement. He has throws where his front foot takes an added stutter step. \nThis is a technique known as a Foot Pop which helps create stability by decelerating their pelvis and torso after maximizing their rotation. \nThis is typically done when throwing to their left or moving forward.  \n\n \n50 \nWard’s stance is also wide and that can lead to throws that are higher than necessary or completely sail on him. He also has the opportunity \nto tighten his release mechanics with his upper body. The ball comes down to his waist and upper thigh during the draw-back phase of his \nrelease. The ball is well behind his shoulder as he brings it up from his waist and he delivers the target with a three-quarter motion.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Ward has velocity to the same side boundary to deliver the out 27 yards from his release and place the \nball outside the peripheral coverage’s path to cut off the target.  \nWard has the arm to deliver a pinpoint post route 63-65 yards down the middle of the field. He did this twice in the Cal game. He \nhas good touch to throw moon balls that give his receivers a chance to win targets on fades.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Ward has good enough feet and athletic ability to deliver on platform – even with jump passes and \nthrows on the move. I didn’t see him throw off-platform but once when he wasn’t under pressure.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: He has pinpoint accuracy at 25 yards from the release point to the opposite boundary.  \nMobile Accuracy: Ward has good short-range accuracy on the move. His intermediate-range accuracy is catchable but not often \npinpoint. His vertical-range accuracy is competent.  \nDecision-Making: When on-script without pressure as an issue, Ward can split the secondary and even a tight split of linebackers \nor safeties to thread the needle to a receiver downfield.   \nWard displays and awareness of defenders on the periphery of where he’s targeting his receivers. More often, he displays \nawareness of defenders who can cut off a target and moves away from that read. When he has lapses, he isn’t considering a route \nrunning near the targeted route and the defender having an easy position to peel off his receiver to attack the ball on the other. \nThis has resulted in an end-zone interception and a dropped interception in the red-zone.  \nWard will work across the field with 2-3 progressions and then work to the opposite field for the check-down.  \nSense Pressure: Ward identifies post-snap safety pressure early in the play. He can scan the width of the field and anticipate when the \npocket is about to break down and begin moving to buy more time as a thrower.  \nWard also spots interior pressure from two levels within the pocket and incrementally works his way outside with a roll. He can also shed \nthe defender and incrementally climb in the pocket.  \nManeuvering From Pressure Ward will flush away from safety blitz and reach the open field. When pressure hasn’t compromised the \npocket but he has spent 2-3 seconds in the pocket and no routes are coming open, Ward drifts deeper to set up opportunities to roll outside \nand buy more time while keeping his eyes downfield. \nWard has a penchant for drifting to the left edge or outside the pocket when it’s unnecessary. It closes off the field for him to make plays. \nThe drifting has forced Ward to throw the ball away when he at least had potential check-downs if he remained in the pocket.  \nWard feels edge pressure to his throwing side and executes a short hitch to climb and throw in rhythm. He also can flush quickly from edge \npressure that gets around the corner and behind him.  \nWard can wait for interior pressure to get within a step of him and he’ll spin and roll to his left. He’ll also side-step interior pressure. He can \nsidestep and then reverse field with a short climb and flush to his left and find an open man downfield who is working free in zone coverage.  \nWard routinely climbs the pocket and combines other maneuvers with it. He combines all of the maneuvers to create space.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Ward has starter-caliber accuracy with most short and intermediate throws and he gives receivers a \nchance to make the play even when he’s not pinpoint accurate.  \nHis vertical accuracy is more hit-or-miss at the boundary, but he gives receivers more of a chance in the middle of the field when \nhe’s not perfect with his placement.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Ward has good enough feet and athletic ability to deliver on platform – even with jump passes and \nthrows on the move. When he’s forced to throw off-platform while under pressure, the accuracy is competent in the shallow zones \nbut hit-or-miss beyond that.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Ward is skilled with opposite-field throws when the range of distance is within 10 yards of the line of \nscrimmage. Beyond that, Ward is usually running or throwing on the move to the same side of the field or the middle of the field.  \n\n \n51 \nMobile Accuracy: Ward can deliver the ball 20 yards to his right while moving to his left and with a three-quarter motion as \npressure is bearing down from backside pursuit. He can deliver the ball 37 yards from the release on the move to his left.  \nDecision-Making: Ward manipulates the secondary outside the pocket with a shoulder fake and directs receivers to work outside-\non as Ward reaches the flat as a scrambler. He finds the open zone.  \nIf Ward has exhausted his options even after he has bought extra time for his receivers to work open, Ward will throw the ball \naway.  \nWard attempts throws across his body on the move to his left with a defender bearing down that are high risk for the black zone \nand really, for any part of the field. There are examples of wide-open targets where Ward makes the athletic play and it’s a sound \ndecision. He must eliminate the targets that are riskier.   \nHe can sidestep and then reverse field with a short climb and flush to his left and find an open man downfield who is working free \nin zone coverage. Ward can layer the ball over defenders in the red zone.  \nWhen pressured, Ward will check-down when forced to the side of the field where there’s an outlet.  \nHe must be wiser about when to throw the ball away in situations where his offense is backed up and the defense has thwarted the \nquick-hitting play. When Ward is inside scoring range – field goal or touchdown – he tries too hard to make a play with the time he \nbuys and it leads to sacks he could have easily avoided. He must address this tendency he showed at Miami and Washington State. \nScrambling: Ward has the quickness to get outside the pocket and settle into open space. This quickness can buy him time to reset, survey \nthe field from a more static position, and get the ball out as defenders are still far enough away that they can’t hinder Ward’s throw.  \nWard can avoid two points of pressure from the pocket and stay inside or work outside the pocket as a scrambler. As mentioned earlier, \nWard has a penchant for drifting to the left edge or outside the pocket when it’s unnecessary. It closes off the field for him to make plays. \nThe drifting has forced Ward to throw the ball away when he at least had potential check-downs if he remained in the pocket.  \nRunning: Ward is capable of moving the chains as a runner when he gets outside the pocket. When he earns open space, he can also \ngenerate big-play rushes. Ward gets his feet high to avoid reaches from backside pursuit. His stiff arm has the timing and placement to \nward off reaches from defensive lineman and force them to the ground.  \nWard has the agility to make defenders miss in the open field. He can transition downhill from a perimeter track with two small steps and \nget inside the shot of a force defender. Ward does not slide and he has opportunities to do so and avoid punishment.  \nDurability: No significant injuries that cost Ward playing time.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: This is not the year I’d recommend taking a quarterback in the opening rounds of a fantasy draft unless \nyour situation meets most of these conditions:  \n• \nYou’re in a Superflex league. \n• \nYour picks are in the back-half of each round.  \n• \nNone of the RSP’s top-five RBs or WRs are available.  \nIn this case, Ward is a viable first-round pick at the late turn.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDrifting in the pocket and cutting off the field unnecessarily \n• \nIntermediate accuracy and where he can tighten up his mechanics as a thrower \n• \nFront foot mechanics during release might need cleaning \n• \nManipulation of S, vertical-range throw, nuance of throwing mechanics \n• \nQuiet climb of pressure and debatable placement was intended \n• \nSplits secondary and no double-tap of plant foot during release \n• \nPinpoint fade to left boundary and thoughts on the release footwork \n• \nSpin and roll from interior pressure, 37-yard throw on move to left for TD \n• \nCompound pocket movements and against-the-grain sidearm to open zone triangle \n• \nFreezes CB with eyes and ball fake and hits sail route breaking behind defender \n• \nTwo red-zone plays: One off-script success and one on-script failure \n• \nBlack-zone/situational mismanagement \n• \nForgoing a clear down-field opportunity on script \n• \nExploiting a clear down-field opportunity on script \n• \nReactionary to a flash of pressure—lapse or problem? \n• \nReactionary to a flash of pressure—second lapse in same game \n• \nPinpoint deep post of 60-65 yards \n\n \n52 \n• \nThree areas to fix: game management off-script, sailing throws, against-the-grain throws \n• \nWell-placed and well-layered seam in vertical range of field \n• \nCurtailing double-tap with plant foot and pinpoint opposite boundary \n• \nGood pocket feel but more self-awareness of limitations as a thrower is needed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n53",
        "analysis": "Cam Ward is a highly touted quarterback prospect with a unique skillset.  His strengths lie in his improvisational ability, exceptional movement skills in and out of the pocket, and arm talent capable of making all NFL throws. He excels at buying time, layering throws over defenses, and manipulating defenders with fakes.  His accuracy on short and intermediate throws, particularly on the move, is a key asset. He also displays good pressure awareness and maneuvering skills.\n\nHowever, Ward has significant opportunities for improvement. His footwork, particularly in the drop back, needs refinement for better consistency and accuracy. He tends to hold the ball too long in crucial situations (red and black zones) and takes unnecessary risks with across-the-body throws.  He sometimes drifts unnecessarily out of the pocket, limiting his options. Improving his decision-making in pressured situations, especially in the red zone, is vital for his NFL success.\n\nThe comparison spectrum of Joe Burrow, Johnny Manziel, and Zach Wilson highlights the duality of Ward's potential. While he possesses the arm talent and improvisational skills reminiscent of Burrow and Manziel, his maturity and decision-making are areas where he needs to avoid the pitfalls of Manziel and the inconsistencies of Wilson.  A refined Manziel-esque style with better game management would be a successful outcome; a Burrow-like progression would be an optimal one.  The key for Ward lies in harnessing his exceptional athleticism and arm strength within a more structured framework, improving his mechanics to minimize risk and maximize efficiency.\n"

I’ll take shots on passers available later who have growth potential as journeymen starters or \nreserves. Maybe one of them surprises us and proves there’s a lot more to his game.  \n \nOtherwise, Milroe is it. Period. End of story.  \n \nIt’s doubtful Milroe will be a first-round pick. He might fall to the fourth round after whispers of higher draft capital entering the season. \nAlabama’s offensive line was not what it used to be under Nick Saban, and you can see the differences with the offensive line during C.J. \nStroud’s rookie year and the one in his sophomore season to understand how it can change public perceptions of a quarterback.  \n \nMilroe’s Senior Bowl performance also hurt his perception. He and the receivers couldn’t get on the same page during practices.  \n \nI don’t care. I’ve seen plenty of quarterbacks have non-descript or bad weeks in Mobile and go onto strong careers. All-star practice analysis \nis one of the best ways to take a left turn into ditch as an evaluator.  \n \nThen, we heard about small hands, which turned out to be an inexperienced staffer measuring Milroe’s hand in Mobile. Next thing you know, \nthere are questions about Milroe’s competitiveness, because he didn’t run the 40-Yard Dash at the NFL Combine.  \n \nSome folks have watched too many Hollywood movies. They want to be the grizzled scout who finds some small layer of information that \ncompletely flips his perception of a prospect upside down, and it leads to him unearthing a stunning gem.  \n \nYes, we all have moments in some aspect of life – meeting your future spouse, hiring a great employee, or making a great late-round pick \nin your fantasy drafts – where a small layer of information catches our eye and everything clicks for us. Look beyond that Hollywood \nmoment and you’ll see years of experience that becomes ingrained enough for us so that the imprinted information registers in our \nsubconscious just before our conscious mind gathers the rest of the story.  \n \nMilroe probably didn’t run the 40-Yard Dash for two reasons: 1) Any idiot knows he’s the fastest quarterback in this draft and has game-\nbreaking speed. 2) According to my sources, the majority of the NFL is still filled with influential decision-makers who think quarterbacks \nshould look like Matthew Stafford, Josh Allen, Mason Rudolph, and Tim Tebow.  \n \nI purposely mentioned these four big-bodied, doughy-cheek quarterbacks because two of them are pocket passers and two of them were \nmore like the way these old-school decision-makers characterized Lamar Jackson before the draft. Still, there wasn’t as much talk about \nmaking these players running backs, receivers, or tight ends. Tebow earned a first-round pick as a quarterback!  \n \nWith these decision-makers in power, Milroe would be fielding requests to workout at other positions after running at the NFL Combine. He \nprobably got feelers after his Pro Day, but at least it wasn’t under a national spotlight.   \n \nMilroe is a quarterback prospect, and a promising one. If anything, I’ve underestimated his accuracy potential in this evaluation and he was \nalready incredibly close to being the QB1 on the RSP’s board.  \n \nMilroe is the best pocket player in this class. He has Lamar Jackson’s quiet feet – the ability to make subtle moves so he can continue \nmanipulating defenders and be in position to throw the ball – in the pocket.  \n \nMilroe is also one of the best in this class at manipulating defenders. He targets linebackers and safeties in the middle of the field, and it’s \nnot that weak sauce of holding the safety during the initial drop.  \n \nNo. Milroe can manipulate linebackers and nickel backs in the middle of the field within 10-15 yards of the line of scrimmage against a blitz. \nMilroe isn’t doing this during the initial drop, either. He’s doing it later in the play when he knows he’ll have a defensive tackle or linebacker \nin his lap if he waits just a half a beat too long to pull the trigger.  \n \nMilroe isn’t early-career Michael Vick or Kyler Murray – quarterbacks who turn their backs or drop their eyes to pressure because they’re \nreacting with a crazy-coo, but crazy-inefficient move that forces the entire offense to adjust to them when mostly unnecessary. Nope. Milroe \nis an efficient mover who can climb, spin, sidestep, flush, and find an open option without killing the original protection or routes of his \nteammates.  \n \nMilroe’s release isn’t a whip-like motion that begins at the quarterback’s toenail like Cam Ward. God Bless Ward, because it works for him, \nbut Milroe has the most compact release in this class – and perhaps several classes. I had to go to Dan Marino’s tape to see if I saw any \nnotable differences between the compactness of their releases.  \n \nMilroe looks like a mythical hero throwing a javelin or lightning bolt. His drop game sets him up well for all the work I just mentioned as a \ndecision-maker and pocket mover.  \n \n\n \n55 \nMilroe must develop touch. It is the one thing missing from his throwing arsenal. He doesn’t get enough air under targets to deliver arching \npasses that drop straight down.  \n \nThis hurts his accuracy with corner fades, honey-hole shots between the safety and corner in Cover 2, and throwing receivers open at the \nboundary. Milroe is prone to overshooting these targets.  \n \nWhen Milroe decides to run, he has the acceleration, speed, and curvilinear movement to weave his way through the field like a big-play \nscat back. He also knows how to slide, something a lot of these big-play runners didn’t learn in college.  \n \nMilroe reminds me a lot of Jalen Hurts. He’s a better runner, pocket manager, and game manager than Hurts. What we don’t know is if \nMilroe has Hurts’ work ethic and obsession with the game.  \n \nWe do know that Milroe was mature enough to handle the pre-draft process. You should also know he won the academic Heisman.  \n \nOverall, Milroe is a good decision-maker. His gaffes are more often the type we see from good starting quarterbacks in the NFL, not green \nprospects used to Hero Ball.  \n \nStill, Alabama’s playbook is not the size of an NFL offense’s, and SEC defenses are not NFL schemes with savvy veterans disguising \nintentions. Milroe will need to acclimate, and he should get plenty of time to do so because, like Jalen Hurts, he’s probably getting picked \nafter Ward, Shedeur Sanders, and Jaxson Dart. Maybe even after Tyler Shough.  \n \nBully for the team that gets Milroe in the third or fourth round. There’s no pressure to start him early. Bully for fantasy GMs who benefit \nfrom the depressed draft capital who make the low-cost investment.  \n \nDrops: Milroe can curtail short drops against interior pressure and sidestep the opponent. He has one-step, two-step, three-step, and five-\nstep drops from Pistol and shotgun and he can vary the step length and pacing. He finishes his drops in a productive stance. He has a \nseven-step drop from center and he can alter the drop with pressure closing early.  \nBall Security: Milroe defaults to the right arm as a ball carrier, even when the play design is to the left side of the field. Until he encounters \npursuit that he sees, Milroe’s security is loose and sometimes wide from his frame. When he encounters pursuit he can see, Milroe secures \nthe ball high and tight to his chest and side. He can take contact to the ball and ball-carrying arm.  \nBacked up in his black zone, Milroe demonstrated wise decision-making when the center snapped the ball ahead of schedule and the ball \nbounced off Milroe’s chest. The QB pounced on the ball rather than trying to scoop it off the ground.  \nWhen in the pocket and maneuvering it from pressure, Milroe keeps both hands on the ball. When he breaks the pocket, the ball can get \nwide or he carries it like he’s running the triple option and he’s susceptible to strip sacks and chops from backside pursuit.  \nPlay Fakes: Milroe has good detail with the exchange and timing with his read fakes. He gets the front foot downhill and uses the runner as \nan initial blocker.  \nHe has some variety with his fakes but the execution could have a little more nuance for great selling of them.  \nMilroe’s pitch fake with a little emphasis with the ball after locking out his arms with a pitch motion is a good example of detail he can apply \nmore often to other fakes.  \nPump Fakes: Milroe shows the ball and delivers a small pump fake after breaking the pocket to freeze a safety coming downhill in pursuit. \nThe violence of the fake is moderate.  \nMilroe also uses a small ball fake from the pocket to manipulate the defense before pivoting to a different route. He pairs the ball fakes with \nhis eyes to move defenders and go opposite field.  \nMilroe has a partial motion and violent pump fake when he’s in the pocket and the pocket is tight. It sets up his break of the pocket as a \nrunner. He rarely uses it and his hand size may limit how much he can do it.  \nRelease: Milroe’s upper-body mechanics are the most compact I’ve seen in this class. There’s no looping motion with the draw back. Milroe \ndraws the arm straight back and behind his shoulder and begins his release. It has the efficiency up top that rivals Dan Marino’s—and yes, I \nlooked at Marino’s motion to verify.  \nThe lower body looks good with deep throws. Milroe aligns the midline of his back foot and his front toe to the target. He generates a lot of \ntorque off his front hip and leg and the back foot comes off the ground early and rotates around. His motion is similar to a javelin or shotput \nthrower.  \nHis release is so compact that Milroe can deliver in tight pockets with an even more truncated motion or a three-quarter release.  \n\n \n56 \nMilroe’s lower body mechanics can get better. There are certain throws where Milroe’s legs need to be in a different position to deliver the \nball with better placement and touch. Dropping the ball into the Cover 2 honey hole and fade routes are good examples. He must learn to \nthrow at different speeds and deliver targets with different trajectories.   \nEven when Milroe places air under the ball, it’s not enough and he’s still overshooting targets. \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Milroe places the ball away from peripheral coverage to protect his receivers. He can layer the ball over \nunderneath coverage in the intermediate passing game in the middle of the field. He protects his receivers frequently with a variety \nof throws.  \nMilroe lacks touch with fades in the red area. He can place more air under the ball. He throws fades on a line and it gives a \ndefender inside the chance to cut off the target with a highpoint of his own.  \nThe same is true with targets requiring touch between Cover 2 or back-shoulder opportunities up the seam.  \nHe has a pinpoint range of 58 yards to the near-side flat. He has catchable accuracy in the same area at 60 yards.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Milroe typically throws on-platform. He buys time well enough so he can make on-platform throws. On \nthe rare occasions he couldn’t, Milroe displayed pinpoint accuracy in the shallow ranges and catchable accuracy in the intermediate \nzones.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Milroe has the arm to deliver throws 40-48 yards to the opposite numbers and/or boundary with \ncatchable accuracy and the ball on a line.  \nMobile Accuracy: Milroe was pinpoint accurate throwing on the move to the shallow zones. He has the capacity for catchable and \npinpoint accuracy in the intermediate, vertical, and deep ranges.  \nDecision-Making: Milroe looks off the defense early in a three-step drop but he can hold his eyes there a beat longer and still \nhave time to pivot to his intended target, assess the leverage of the receiver on the defender, and make the throw.  \nMilroe identifies pre-snap pressure and knows where the likely hole in coverage will result, targeting that option as his first read. \nHe’s aware of defenders on the periphery and uses wise placement choices. Milroe can work to his second option or manipulate the \ndefense with his eyes on Mesh concepts.  \nMilroe does not see the shallow flat defender sliding from the hash or flat to the boundary to undercut shallow boundary throws. \nThe same is true with deeper throws crossing the field where that flat or boundary defender can undercut the target. He must show \nmore awareness of ancillary coverage in these situations.  \nHe has lapses as a decision-maker where he has a vertical route that appears open at the opposite flat but he pulls the ball down \nlast-second because he’s concerned about the middle-of-the-field safety who might reach the target. He opts for the shallower \nroute. This was a safer decision, but debatable that he made the correct one.  \nMilroe is aggressive up the seam and attacks targets based on favorable leverage, delivering with excellent placement.  \nSense Pressure: Milroe identifies pre-snap and post-snap pressure from the inside. He can wait until a defender is within a step of him to \nbreak the pocket or climb it. He spots front side and blind side pressure as well as pressure up the middle. He also sniffs out front side and \nback side edge pressure from defensive backs wide of the box. \nManeuvering From Pressure: Milroe identifies interior pressure early in his drop and curtails his footwork to sidestep the defender. He \nreduces his shoulder from the defender’s reach and pulls through whatever contact the defender can make.  \nMilroe executes a quick climb and sidestep of pressure to reset and fire from the pocket with at least catchable accuracy in the shallow \nrange of the field. He has quiet feet: He doesn’t need a lot of movement to manipulate one side of the field and at the last moment, make a \nsmall adjustment of his frame to target the far side of the field and accurately. His vertical throws can sail on him in the same scenarios and \nhis feet aren’t fully aligned with the target.  \nAt the same time, Milroe also completes vertical passes with placement among 2-3 defenders where the receiver is the only player who can \nearn the target.  \nMilroe has an effective climb-and-flush combination to work into open space. He also delivers a quick spin and roll to his right from interior \npressure.  \n \n\n \n57 \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: When forced to climb, he can climb in rhythm and fire the ball, but his vertical-range routes in the middle \nof the field can sail on him. He must set his feet more in line with the target after climbing.  \nWhen he has a wide-open target and pressure is bearing down, Milroe understands when to take something off the vertical throw, \nso the receiver has a catchable pass that isn’t overthrown.  \nHe’s capable of pinpoint accuracy with pressure in his face at a distance of 48 yards from the pitch.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Milroe has pinpoint accuracy on routes breaking to the flat that cover 15 yards from his release point. He \nhas no worse than catchable accuracy to the short sideline with a defender partially wrapping him in the pocket and Milroe is \nthrowing off his back foot afterward.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Milroe can deliver the ball 30 yards to the opposite boundary with pressure compressing the pocket \nand striking him as he finishes his release.  \nMobile Accuracy: Milroe can deliver the ball 53 yards from his release when moving right and have pinpoint back-shoulder \naccuracy. He has a range of 46 yards off his back foot while rolling right. Milroe also can deliver 50 yards to his right with pinpoint \naccuracy.  \nDecision-Making: Milroe can work through 2-3 timely reads with pressure in the pocket. He’s a quick decision-maker who can \nmaneuver from pressure and find the open man.  \nIn two-minute situations, Milroe wisely eschews the slightly deeper target in the middle of the field for a boundary target because \ntime is the higher priority than yardage if the yardage opportunity isn’t significantly greater.  \nMilroe can make multiple reads from the pocket and with a lineman getting backed into Milroe’s lap, Milroe can move a linebacker \nwith his eyes and make an off-platform throw that’s accurate in the intermediate range of the field.  \nMilroe will look away from his intended target late in the progression so he can believably hold a safety inside before delivering his \nrelease back to the outside. He does this with pressure earning a push into his lap.  \nWhen pressure gets into Milroe’s face early, he’ll use a stiff arm to ward off the defender as he throws the ball away. When he has \nlapses with holding onto the ball, it happens in the black zone after making the first defender miss and breaking the pocket. This \ndoesn’t happen enough to dock him, but it’s worth monitoring.  \nScrambling: Milroe can avoid 1-2 points of pressure in the backfield during his drop and quickly break the pocket or show patience with 2 \npoints of pressure and set up a break from the pocket without creating an additional point of pressure.  \nHe can buy time in and outside the pocket. He can break the reaches of defensive linemen in the back to earn positive yards.  \nMilroe can slide outside interior pressure but make the quick stop and climb so he remains inside the pocket.  \nRunning: Milroe has the acceleration to work past box defenders quickly as he breaks the pocket. He also has the suddenness with \npressure cuts to press a downfield safety and dip away from the defender late enough that the safety can’t change his angle of pursuit on \ntime. He also throws in a pump fake with the dip that can freeze the defender.  \nMilroe has the acceleration to get the short corner on box defenders and split linebackers and safeties. He can also turn the corner when \nworking to the far-side of the formation. He can turn the corner on a short-field cornerback on a read-option carry and outrun the field.  \nMilroe has excellent curvilinear bend and speed in the open field. He can undercut secondary defenders in pursuit, carving an S in the open \nfield to work from one flat to the opposite boundary. He has a top speed of 21 mph.  \nMilroe can press the line of scrimmage within a step and open his hips with the point of the toe so he can bounce outside. He only needs \none step to transition downhill from a perimeter approach. He has a tight spin to get outside pursuit or work off contact. Milroe also has an \nexcellent hip shift to work past a box defender in traffic.  \nWhen finishing runs in the middle of the field, he’ll slide.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: The smart play is to target Milroe in the second or third round, if not later, in fantasy drafts before the \nNFL’s referendum on Milroe’s draft capital. Milroe isn’t as ready as Lamar Jackson was, but he’s not a multi-year project like Jordan Love, \neither. He’s more like what folks hoped they were seeing with Malik Willis. \n\n \n58 \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nCompact release and velocity \n• \nCurtails drop, sidesteps interior pressure, manipulates safety as runner \n• \nGreat release, pinpoint opposite field, and excellent placement \n• \nShort-corner acceleration past a CB with an angle \n• \nCurvilinear bend and speed in the open field \n• \nSubtle maneuvering – short climb and sidestep--of the pocket \n• \nSmart red-zone placement between zone triangle \n• \nWise two-minute decision-making \n• \nMultiple reads, manipulates LB, off-platform vs pressure, accurate \n• \nManipulation techniques and quiet feet in the pocket \n• \nPinpoint post of 45 yards with pressure in his face \n• \nDisplays awareness of DB on periphery and placement to protect receiver \n• \nLayered throw over linebacker \n• \nTouch needed on the fade \n• \nSimple example of anticipation \n• \nAdvanced vertical placement and layering from tight pocket \n• \nTwo interceptions vs. OU \n• \n53-yard heavy rolling right for an accurate back-shoulder reception \n• \nBall security woes \n• \n26 yards in the honey hole of C2 \n• \nThrowing open TE up the seam \n• \nOpposite boundary under pressure and 19 yards pinpoint \n• \nFlat defender peeling off the assignment at the hash to undercut the boundary route \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n59",
        "analysis": "**Jalen Milroe: QB Prospect Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Mobility:**  Milroe possesses game-breaking speed and agility, comparable to Jalen Hurts but potentially even better as a runner and pocket manager. He displays excellent curvilinear movement, acceleration, and the ability to slide, mitigating injury risk.  He's adept at avoiding pressure through various techniques (sidestepping, climbing, spinning, flushing).\n* **Compact and Efficient Release:**  His release is described as the most compact in the draft class, possibly rivaling Dan Marino's. This allows him to deliver accurate throws even in tight pockets.  He demonstrates impressive velocity.\n* **Pocket Presence and Manipulation:** Milroe displays \"quiet feet\" and subtle movements within the pocket, effectively manipulating defenders (linebackers and safeties) to create throwing lanes.  He's not reckless; his movement enhances, rather than hinders, the offense.\n* **Accuracy (with caveats):**  He shows pinpoint accuracy on short and intermediate throws, both on and off-platform, even under pressure. His deep throws, however, often lack touch and are prone to being overshot.\n* **Decision-Making:**  Milroe is generally a good decision-maker, making timely reads and showing awareness of defensive coverage. He's capable of working through progressions, even under pressure, prioritizing time over yardage when necessary (e.g., two-minute drills).\n* **Arm Strength:**  He possesses the arm strength to make deep throws to both near and far hashmarks.\n* **Intangibles:** He's shown maturity in the pre-draft process and won the academic Heisman.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Develop Touch:**  This is his biggest area for improvement.  He needs to develop better touch on deep and intermediate throws, especially fades and throws into tight windows.\n* **Improve Deep Ball Accuracy:** While his arm strength is good, more consistent accuracy on deep throws is crucial.\n* **Refine Ball Security:** While not a major issue, he sometimes carries the ball loosely when scrambling.\n* **Adjust to NFL Complexity:**  The NFL presents more complex defenses and playbooks than he encountered at Alabama. Adapting to this will be key.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\n* **Jalen Hurts:** The most prominent comparison.  Milroe is considered a better runner and pocket manager than Hurts, but his work ethic and long-term development remain to be seen.\n* **Lamar Jackson:**  His quiet feet and ability to manipulate defenders in the pocket draw comparisons to Jackson.\n* **Malik Willis:**  A comparison suggesting a similar high-upside, high-risk profile.  However, the evaluation implies Milroe is significantly more polished.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe evaluation strongly favors Milroe as a top quarterback prospect in the draft.  While concerns exist regarding his deep ball accuracy and touch, his mobility, release, pocket presence, and decision-making skills make him an attractive prospect with high potential.  The author believes his draft stock is undervalued due to factors like a subpar Senior Bowl performance and unfounded concerns about his hand size and competitiveness.  He projects as a potential starter, but the timeline for reaching that point depends on his ability to improve his touch and adjust to the complexities of the NFL.\n"

Hard not to see – like those \ndomestic fireworks in your cul-de-sac where the wife was throwing her husband’s clothing out the window. Hopefully, not that bad, but I’m \nsure that’s the mood many of you are feeling.  \n \n\n \n60 \nSanders’ score is on par with Rattlers, but they are different styles of player. Rattler is a better athlete, but not the decision-maker Sanders \nis.  \n \nI’ll admit that Sanders’ score and ranking was higher than I expected after I watched the film and performed much of my analysis of his \ngame. Still, the overall tenor of what I expect from Sanders’ career lines up with the film.   \n \nSanders is an aspiring Geno Smith/Tua Tagovailoa style of passer. He can create when necessary – and it was all too necessary for him to \ncreate at Colorado – but he’s at his best as a distributor.  \n \nSanders has well-defined short drops, a good release, and strong anticipation of the quick game. His pacing as an engineer of an offense \ncan be an asset.  \n \nSanders is not just a quick-game passer. He has the arm and baseline accuracy to attack in the vertical game and the decision-making \npromise to do damage in the middle of the field as a timing passer.  \nSanders is at his best with the quick-hitting short routes and the slow-developing, downfield routes that work across the field. When \nfactoring the quality of Sanders’ drops and play-action game, he has promise to develop into a capable West Coast quarterback in an \noffense system like the Kubiak/Stefanski/McVay/Shanahan schemes in the NFL.   \nSanders is a patient passer with enough pocket skills to buy time and create both on- and off-script. He’s not a dynamic mover in the Josh \nAllen-Jalen Hurts-Lamar Jackson archetype.  \nThink Geno Smith and Baker Mayfield as the archetypical wheelhouse for Sanders as an athlete. Smith and Mayfield needed time to \ncalibrate their athletic limits in the NFL. Expect Sanders to enter the league with some overconfidence in his athletic traits as well.  \nStill, Sanders has shown promise as a player who can make adjustments. He has done this well when opposing coverage has gotten the \nbetter of him. The following week, if not the following half of the same game, Sanders often learns his lesson and makes a wiser decision \nwith the same disguise or coverage look.  \nPre-snap, Sanders will identify the cushion of a defender in a two-man route combination and make the efficient drop and throw to the open \nman at the boundary and short out-breaking routes. With deep vertical routes in the middle of the field, he doesn’t identify the favorable \nleverage as quickly or accurately and this can lead him to abandon the pocket or check-down.  \nSanders is not as proficient with quick-game concepts where he must read sideline to sideline. He can be faster with identifying where to go \non same-side concepts like double slants.   \nSanders is also prone to targeting intermediate routes breaking back to him at the boundary when there’s a defender squatting on the route \nover the top. Sanders does not understand the defender has the leverage advantage, especially when throwing from the far hash.  \nCompounding the problem, Sanders takes the risk with these routes in his team’s red zone. Black-zone decision-making, especially early in \ncontests, should be far more conservative and minimize risk.  \nHe must mature as a game-manager. Some of his behavior may be the influence of his role as one of the few offensive leaders at Colorado. \nThis is a common dynamic for college quarterback that must be tempered in the NFL.  \nSanders will throw the ball away if interior pressure reaches the pocket quickly or the pocket is so compressed that he can’t move away \nfrom the read that isn’t open. He must learn to throw the ball away earlier when on designed sprints. He lacks high-end mobility and he \nmust trust his eyes more and his legs less or he’ll look like early-career Mayfield and Smith.  \nSanders holds one side of the field to set up a throw to the opposite flat and will stand in against interior pressure to execute. I don’t see \nmanipulation of defenders in the middle of the field. This is why his ability to win in the middle of the field often has some projection to the \nanalysis.  \nI really don’t want to see Sanders thrust into a starting role immediately. If the team is good enough, especially along the offensive line, \nand there’s a strong ground component that sets up longer-developing plays with time to execute, Sanders could produce. If he’s forced to \nbe more like C.J. Stroud, that could be difficult.  \nSanders has enough throwing talent and athletic ability to start in the NFL, but those are not the difference-making traits of his game. His \nmind for the game and willingness to work at it will have to be.  \nDrops: Sanders has a well-defined drop from Pistol/Shotgun even when it’s one or two steps. He drops into a balanced stance that is a little \nwider than shoulder width. He narrows the stance to shoulder width before he begins his throwing motion.  \n\n \n61 \nSanders can make the quick one-step drop and throw to the opposite flat from under center. He has good spacing with three-step drops but \nthe pacing must be quicker.  \nHis three-, five-, and seven-step drops are well-paced and finish with a balanced stance. He can manipulate opponents during his drops \nwhen he opens his torso to a side of the field.  \nSanders pivots efficiently into his stance off a read fake.  \nBall Security: Sanders holds the ball with both hands as he drops and stands in the pocket. When he accelerates to break the pocket, the \nball drops to his thighs and he waves the ball around as he runs—I wish I could spin it as a series of pump fakes—but it would be like telling \nyou the moon landing was faked. Pursuit has forced fumbles because of Sanders’ lapses with ball security.  \nSanders has been a part of multiple snaps in the red zone where he wasn’t ready or the center had the wrong snap count—both are \nSanders’ responsibility as the leader of the unit.  \nPlay Fakes: Sanders follows through with the read exchange thoroughly. He has a thorough pitch fake to set up a sprint pass in the \nopposite direction. He’s quick and precise with his reverse fake after delivering the fly sweep.  \nPump Fakes: Sanders has a pump fake where he earns complete arm motion with the ball but the violence is minimal. It looks like he’s \npawing at the air with the ball. He’ll also flash the ball with minimal movement.  \nRelease: Sanders delivers the ball with an efficient, over-the-shoulder motion that’s compact and with a high release point. There’s weight \ntransfer from the back foot to the front.  \nThe midline of the back foot is aligned with the target. Sanders doesn’t get his front toe pointed on out-breaking routes as often as he \nshould and it can lead to the ball being behind the target, even when catchable. The toe is often pointed to the right of his frame and not \ndownfield to the breakpoint of the target. This can force him to stretch his upper body through the release to get the ball to his left and \nprobably places more strain on his shoulder and arm than necessary.  \nSanders has an effective sidearm release in the RPO/screen game.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Sanders can deliver the ball 45-47 yards up the nearside boundary with air under the ball, but has to get \nthe ball in front of his receiver with a lower trajectory. When he does, he can deliver with at least general accuracy and frequently \npinpoint accuracy.  \nHe has pinpoint accuracy more often at 40-44 yards against tight man coverage up the boundary. He can deliver a deep target \nwith catchable accuracy a distance of 50 yards if the receiver has enough separation and slow his pacing the final 5-7 yards.  \nSanders can layer the ball over linebackers and lead the receiver away from a safety.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Sanders displays catchable accuracy in the short and intermediate ranges of the field when throwing off-\nplatform.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Sanders is a good thrower to the opposite hash. He has pinpoint accuracy in the short, intermediate, \nand vertical ranges of the field.  \nMobile Accuracy: He can throw with pinpoint accuracy on the move to his right 15-20 yards downfield.  \nDecision-Making: Sanders throws short speed outs with anticipation against zone and off-man coverage. He will give a brief look \nto the opposite side or middle of the field before targeting a go route up the opposite boundary. He could sell the look a little longer \nlike he does on designed misdirection where he turns and sets up to one boundary before making a quick turn and throw to the \nopposite sideline. He does a better job of holding defenders to the outside before going inside. \nPre-snap, Sanders will identify the cushion of a defender in a two-man route combination and make the efficient drop and throw to \nthe open man at the boundary and short out-breaking routes. With deep vertical routes in the middle of the field, he doesn’t \nidentify the favorable leverage as quickly or accurately and this can lead him to abandon the pocket or check-down.  \nSanders has missed rotations that should immediately register as a vertical shot opportunity and this leads to a check-down. He \nhas also identified the same rotations in the next game that he missed in the game before.  \nHe’s not as proficient with quick-game concepts where he must read sideline to sideline. He can be faster with identifying where to \ngo on double slants.   \n\n \n62 \nHe’s better with slow-developing intermediate routes where he can watch how 1-2 receivers stretch the zone and then determine if \nhis receiver eventually entering that space will have enough of an opening to target. Sanders is also patient with targeting \nreceivers in zone windows. He’ll wait for the receiver to access the next window if the first isn’t worth the risk.  \nHe’s not as strong at identifying or pulling the trigger on tight, but targetable, windows that require laying the ball over a flat \ndefender.  \nWhen he abandons the pocket, he can hold onto the ball while looking downfield with pursuit closing. He has been sacked when he \nshould have thrown the ball away earlier in the play’s sequence. Sanders has done this in the middle of the field and in the red \nzone and it’s a habit he must break.  \nWhen targeting deep vertical routes, he can drop back and open to the opposite side of the target and hold the safety for a \nsignificant amount of time.  \nSanders holds one side of the field during his drops and gets the ball out fast once he pivots to this targeted route. He can move a \nlinebacker a few steps away from the intended target.  \nSense Pressure: Sanders can feel the push of the pocket up the middle within a step of him. The same is true with edge pressure getting \ninside the tackle. He has a good feel for when to sidestep from edge pressure early in the pocket. When edge pressure arrives, he’s at his \nbest to take action 3-4 steps away. Otherwise, he can’t outrun them.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Sanders can hop away from interior pressure and transition to a roll. He can efficiently flush from edge \npressure taking a path inside the tackle into the pocket. He can reverse his field with a spin away from edge pressure to the same side it \noriginated. After spinning and rolling, he has the stop-start ability to force a defender to overrun the angle of pursuit and he’ll then climb \nand throw.  \nSanders can reduce the shoulder  from edge pressure and sidestep or flush. He climbs from bookend pressures in the pocket or a single \nedge defender. He’ll climb and then slide to his left once in the flat so he can open a passing lane downfield.  \nHe has intermediate accuracy off his pocket and scrambling maneuvers. He’ll take the hit to deliver a big play.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: He can layer a pinpoint intermediate over route over a linebacker in the flat after sidestepping pressure \narriving at his right.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: When forced off-platform, Sanders has catchable short accuracy and pinpoint intermediate accuracy.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Sadners has catchable accuracy 38 yards to the opposite flat on the back-shoulder fade against \nmultiple defenders in the area and a defender bearing down on Sanders during the release.  \nMobile Accuracy: Sanders has pinpoint accuracy rolling to his right from pressure at 18 yards to the target. He can move and \nthrow to his left with pressure trailing and deliver a catchable target low and away to the boundary at 28 yards from the release. \nHe has pinpoint accurate throws 25 yards to the boundary.  \nDecision-Making: Sanders is prone to targeting intermediate routes breaking back to him at the boundary when there’s a \ndefender squatting on the route over the top. Sanders does not understand the defender has the leverage advantage, especially \nwhen throwing from the far hash.  \nCompounding the problem, Sanders takes the risk with these routes in his team’s red zone. Black-zone decision-making, especially \nearly in contests, should be far more conservative and minimize risk.  \nSanders will throw the ball away if interior pressure reaches the pocket quickly or the pocket is so compressed that he can’t move \naway from the read that isn’t open. He must learn to throw the ball away earlier when on designed sprints. He lacks high-end \nmobility and he must trust his eyes more and his legs less.  \nSanders holds one side of the field to set up a throw to the opposite flat and will stand in against interior pressure to execute. I \ndon’t see manipulation of defenders in the middle of the field.  \nHe places targets low and away from coverage that could otherwise cut off or hit the receiver.  \nScrambling: Sanders’ stop-start movement is effective at forcing opponents to overrun their angles of pursuit. He retreats a lot when \nbuying time, but when he uses this move, he usually throws the ball away. He can buy time from one side of the field to the other. He \nmoves around like a slow Kyler Murray. He is strong enough to pull through reaches to his frame in the pocket.  \n\n \n63 \nRunning: Sanders has the short-area quickness to outflank pursuit in traffic and he can come to a quick stop, but his re-start quickness is \nnot notable. Sanders can run through glancing shots to his side from safeties and force them to wrap up. He’ll slide when possible. He has \nenough speed to turn the corner on some linebackers.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Sanders has some variability to his post-draft value based on draft capital and team fit. Pre-draft, if \nSanders falls to the end of the second-round in a Superflex format – unlikely – he’s worth consideration. Otherwise, focus on RBs and WRs.  \nAfter all, if Sanders follows the paths of Mayfield and Smith, you might have a second or third chance at him for much less.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMismanagement of black zone and bad leverage read \n• \nMissing the safety rotation amid continuous pressure \n• \nArm talent: throws moving left and moving right in vertical range \n• \nOpposite boundary back-shoulder at 37 yards vs tight coverage  \n• \nReckless decision in the red zone but the context behind the RSP’s scoring of it \n• \nClimb, flush, throw moving right and accounting for zone triangle leverage with placement \n• \n50 yards, catchable accuracy \n• \nRed-zone INT and ways Sanders could have manipulated the safety \n• \nMisses safety rotation and resulting wide-open deep seam for potential TD \n• \nNext game…spots safety rotation he missed and generates big play \n• \nSecond two botched red-zone snaps in as many games \n• \nOpposite boundary 39 yards with DL barreling down the chute \n• \nIDs the potential free play downfield \n• \n50 yards back-shoulder \n• \nManipulating MOF defenders outside to setup target inside \n• \nTwo reversals of field as a scrambler and completing the opposite-boundary throw \n• \nRed-zone fade \n• \nVertical placement away from C2 safety and layered over LB \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n64",
        "analysis": "Shedeur Sanders is a QB prospect ranked QB3 by RSP, possessing a blend of strengths and weaknesses that project him as a developmental starter in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy and Anticipation:**  Exhibits strong accuracy, especially on short and intermediate routes, and demonstrates good anticipation in the quick game.  His accuracy extends to the deep ball, particularly to the opposite hash.\n* **Pocket Presence and Manipulation:** Possesses well-defined drops and a good release. Shows patience in the pocket, buying time effectively, and displays some ability to manipulate defenders with his drops.  He can feel pressure well and sidestep or evade rushers.\n* **Arm Talent:** Has the arm strength to make all the throws, including deep balls with sufficient accuracy.\n* **Play Action and RPOs:** Effective in play-action passing and RPOs, showing a solid ability to execute fakes.\n* **Game Manager Potential:** With the right system, he can effectively manage the offense and minimize mistakes.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Decision-Making under Pressure:** Prone to forcing throws into tight coverage, especially in the red zone. Needs to improve his decision-making in these situations and learn to throw the ball away more often.  He sometimes misses easy reads, though he demonstrates the ability to learn from those mistakes.\n* **Reading Sideline to Sideline:** Needs to improve reading through progressions more quickly, particularly on quick-game concepts that require sideline-to-sideline reads.\n* **Black Zone Decision-Making:** Red zone decision making needs significant improvement. He must be more conservative and risk-averse in close quarters.\n* **Ball Security:**  His ball security while scrambling needs attention, as fumbles have been caused by his loose handling.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report explicitly compares Sanders to Baker Mayfield, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith.  The comparison highlights a similar athletic profile to Mayfield and Smith, requiring time to refine their game, along with the distributing style of Tagovailoa and Smith.  He's also compared to Spencer Rattler, though the evaluator notes Rattler's superior athleticism while Sanders possesses better decision-making.  The overall assessment suggests a path similar to Mayfield and Smith, indicating a potentially high-ceiling player needing time and the right scheme to reach his full potential, possibly even needing time as a backup before proving himself as a starter.  His scrambling style is likened to a slower Kyler Murray.\n"

He suffered a torn ACL while at Ohio and after \nrebounding from the injury in 2023, he set off for Indiana in 2024.  \n \nI began watching Rourke in mid-January of this year. He had had a strong season – 3,042 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions. His \nquarterback rating was top-five in the country. You know I’m not a box-score scout, but you’ll see why I’m setting this scene in a moment.   \n \nI was impressed with how Rourke dismantled UCLA and held up well against top Big 10 teams on the way to an 11-win season. He helped \nthe Hoosiers reach the playoffs in a conference that contained a shit-ton of established programs.  \n \nRourke moves well in the pocket and has good downfield accuracy. He doesn’t look like a top-end athlete as a scrambler, but he possesses \na feel for pursuit and often breaks the pocket, buys time, and if needed, moves the chains with his legs.  \n \nRourke is an accurate thrower thanks to his clean footwork and compact and efficient release mechanics. He holds middle of the field \ndefenders to one side of the field to buy room to target a route breaking from the opposite side of the field. Rourke does this all well within \nthe rhythm of his drops and the routes.  \nHe can sell the out with a good long look to the corner so he can deliver the corner route breaking behind the corner in C2. Rourke will set \nup a screen with a look to the wide route or swing route from the back to the right and come back to his smoke screen to the receiver \ncoming from the left to the middle of the field.  \nHe is confident targeting receivers in tight windows of coverage and has the placement to do so. The upper range of Rourke’s accuracy was \n40-45 yards downfield last year, but I’ve seen a deeper range from him at Ohio.  \n \nRourke is particularly skilled with placement in the vertical passing game and accounting for the peripheral defender peeling off his spot to \nassist with coverage. He can work through multiple reads, sidestep pressure, reset, and deliver the ball so if his receiver obeys the \nplacement, the receiver can split defenders in coverage for additional yardage.  \nAfter surveying 2-3 reads across the field or high-low, Rourke has the pocket clock and management skills to slide outside the pocket and \nhit his check-down on the move. When forced to sidestep pressure or slide outside the pocket after his first 1-2 reads, Rourke will throw the \nball away.  \nRourke is a smart quarterback with technical skill and promising conceptual knowledge that translates to the field.  \nHe also showed a little toughness, opting for thumb surgery so he could only miss one game this year after breaking it.  \n \nMeanwhile, few knew that Rourke was tougher than a box of ring-shank nails. At least not until the first week of January, when the public \nlearned that Rourke played the entire season with an ACL tear – to the same knee he injured in 2022!   \n \nYou wouldn’t have known Rourke was playing through this type of injury. He wore a small brace, yes, but go back and reread everything up \nto this point once more. Rourke is a compelling prospect.  \n \nOf course, Rourke has further development ahead. Rourke can underestimate the position of trail coverage on in-breaking routes like digs, \ncrossers, and slants. He can also miss the linebacker or safety because he presumes the defender will follow a crosser but instead, stops \nand hangs in the shallow zone to cut off the target working behind them. \nAlthough, happening infrequently, Rourke has lapses where he forces the ball into a well-covered receiver in the middle of the field where \nthere are too many peripheral defenders in range to clean up a tipped pass.  \nThere’s nothing significantly wrong with Rourke’s game beyond his twice-torn ACL. I asked Dr. Jene Bramel about Rourke. As long as there \nwas no other damage to the knee, isolated ACL tears may take a lot of time and work to heal, but there is no significant impact to athletic \nability.  \n \nIf we learn Rourke’s injuries were simply isolated ACL tears, there should be little concern about his health moving forward. If that’s the \ncase, Rourke will likely earn late-round draft capital, a red-shirt season, and an opportunity to learn behind an established veteran.  \n \nIf these things come to pass, color me unsurprised if Rourke emerges as one of the best quarterbacks in this class.  \n  \nDrops: Rourke has clean two-step, three-step, and five-step drops from Pistol.  \nBall Security: Rourke carries the ball close to his chest, but his arms move when running in the open field. He uses the right arm as his \ndefault place to secure the ball, even when running to the left boundary. When it’s a designed run to the left, he can tuck to the left arm.  \nPlay Fakes: Rourke extends the ball well into the read fake and does so with good timing. In addition to read plays, Rourke can take two \nsteps forward and to the side with his pads dipped to simulate a play fake that manipulates defender and there’s no running back in the \nbackfield—good simulation of a red-zone keeper.  \n\n \n66 \nRourke has a nice little punch at the top of his pitch fake.  \nPump Fakes: Rourke will flash the ball to deliver a fake that sets up a run. He also delivers a notable shoulder fake to set up a double \nmove or manipulate the coverage before pivoting in another direction to a different route.  \nRelease: Rourke earns a balanced set up out of his drops. The midline of his back foot is aligned to the target. He steps into his throw with \nhis front foot and the toe pointed to the target.  \nRourke’s release is compact, efficient, and quick. The ball doesn’t dip below his chest during the draw back. He has a quick over-the-\nshoulder release.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: He has pinpoint accuracy 26 yards from the pitch against trail coverage to the middle of the field. Rourke \nis confident targeting receivers in tight windows of coverage and has the placement to do so.  \nHe has underestimated the position of trail coverage on intermediate over routes and also lacked pinpoint placement to properly \nlead the receiver. He placed the ball back-shoulder with trail coverage in position to undercut the ball.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Rourke displayed short-range accuracy on the rare occasions he threw off-platform. \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Rourke is pinpoint on the back-shoulder fade against tight man coverage 38 yards from his release \npoint. He’s pinpoint on the deep out of 20 yards to the opposite boundary.  \nWith his knee injury, Rourke’s upper rage with accuracy is between 40-45 yards.  \nMobile Accuracy: He was not asked to throw on the move by design this year, the team obviously knew about the ACL tear.  \nDecision-Making: Rourke holds middle of the field defenders to one side of the field to buy room to target a route breaking from \nthe opposite side of the field. He does this well within the rhythm of his drops and the routes.  \nRourke can underestimate the position of trail coverage on in-breaking routes like digs, crossers, and slants. He can also miss the \nlinebacker or safety to Rourke presumes will follow a crosser, but the defender stops and hangs in the shallow zone to cut off the \ntarget working behind him.  \nRourke is particularly skilled with placement in the vertical passing game and accounting for the peripheral defender peeling off his \nspot to assist with coverage.  \nHe has uncommon lapses where he forces the ball into a well-covered receiver in the middle of the field where there are too many \nperipheral defenders in range to clean up a tipped pass.  \nSense Pressure: Rourke identifies edge and interior pressure post-snap. He allows edge and interior pressure to get within 1-2 steps of \nhim before making an adjustment. This buys him time because the momentum of the defender is too strong to change direction as quickly \nto Rourke’s evasive maneuver.  \nRourke displays a good feel for when to leave the pocket based on the amount of time he has been in it and the number of quick reads he \nhas assessed.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Rourke displays economy to sidestep pressure, reset, and find the open intermediate hole in a C3 zone. He \nallows A-Gap pressure to get within a step and spin away from the defender.  \nRourke will climb edge pressure and, based on coverage, he’ll break the pocket and run. He has some feel for taking a step back from \npressure and buying a moment to throw the ball. He’ll also work outside the pocket and roll to his left or right.   \nRourke is effective at reducing his shoulder, climbing through a reach from edge pressure in the pocket, and flushing to his right to find a \nthrowing lane. He can deliver on the move to his right off the flush with a defender in his face 24 yards with general accuracy to the open \nzone. \nRourke can duck under interior pressure and if he maintains his balance through the climb, he can break the pocket or throw downfield. \nWhen Rourke knows he has a one-on-one or a slower developing route breaking to a wide-open part of the field, he will wait patiently for \nthe route to develop and take the hit if necessary to target the receiver.  \n \n \n\n \n67 \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Rourke leads receivers away from the safety with his intermediate throws. He layers the ball over flat \ndefenders while taking hits from blitzers bearing down on him.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: When forced off-platform, Rourke had a mix of catchable and pinpoint accuracy in the shallow ranges of \nthe field.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Rourke can throw off his back foot with pressure bearing down and deliver a pinpoint throw 10 yards \nover the middle from his release.  \nMobile Accuracy: Rourke can deliver the ball with general accuracy to the boundary at 15 yards while on the move to his left.  \nDecision-Making: Rourke can work through multiple reads, sidestep pressure, reset, and deliver the ball so if his receiver obeyed \nthe placement, the receiver could split defenders in coverage for additional yardage.  \nRourke will set up a screen with a look to the wide route or swing route from the back to the right and come back to his smoke \nscreen to the receiver coming from the left to the middle of the field.  \nAfter surveying 2-3 reads across the field or high-low, Rourke has the pocket clock and management skills to slide outside the \npocket and hit his check-down on the move.  \nHe can sell the out with a good long look to the corner so he can deliver the corner route breaking behind the corner in C2.  \nWhen forced to sidestep pressure or slide outside the pocket after his first 1-2 reads, Rourke will throw the ball away.  \nScrambling: Although not a dynamic mover, Rourke can buy time in a pocket and work away from two points of pressure to create a \nsecond- or third-chance opportunity to target a receiver.  \nRunning: Rourke has enough athletic ability to move the chains in the open field. He finishes runs with a slide or gets out of bounds.  \nDurability: Played with a torn ACL in 2024. Had ACL revision surgery in January 2025. He tore the same ACL in 2022 at Ohio late in the \nseason. He suffered a thumb injury against Nebraska and had surgery to speed up his recovery and missed one game—while playing \nthrough the torn ACL.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Likely a late-round NFL pick, at best. Rourke is an ideal practice squad,  IR stash in 2025 who could pay \ndividends in 2026-2027.  \nIf your roster sizes are under 40, Rourke is a player to monitor from afar. If over 40 players, consider stashing him. Either way, he’ll be a \nfun option to monitor because you may land a hidden gem thanks to the short and reactive memories of the NFL and fantasy-playing public.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSide-steps pressure, resets, finds hole in C3, and accounts for S with throw \n• \nTiming of spin from A-Gap pressure \n• \nBad snap, regains rhythm, holds MOF coverage, finds intermediate dig, pinpoint \n• \nSenses edge pressure, alters drop, and timely climb and throw \n• \nC0 blitz, layers ball over the flat defender, and hits over route while taking hit \n• \nClimbs and pulls through reach of pressure, flushes, and connects while on the move \n• \nMisreads leverage advantage of trail coverage and suboptimal placement on INT \n• \nPlay fake and throws TE open  \n• \nOpposite boundary back-shoulder fade pinpoint at 32 yards from pitch to catch \n• \nPlacement in the vertical game and accounting for peripheral coverage \n• \nPinpoint opposite field 45 yards with DT bearing down \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n68",
        "analysis": "Kurtis Rourke: QB Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy:**  Exceptional accuracy, especially on platform throws,  across short to intermediate ranges and even showing deep accuracy (40-45 yards, potentially deeper previously).  Pinpoint accuracy demonstrated on back-shoulder throws and to the opposite hash.  Maintains accuracy even under pressure, layering throws over defenders.\n* **Pocket Presence:**  Excellent pocket awareness, displaying good footwork and a compact, efficient release.  Able to manipulate defenders with play-fakes and pump-fakes.  Effectively sidesteps pressure, resets his feet, and finds open receivers. Shows good feel for when to leave the pocket.\n* **Processing & Decision-Making:**  Works through multiple reads effectively.  Shows good understanding of coverage and adjusts throws accordingly, accounting for peripheral defenders.  Intelligent in his decision-making, often throwing the ball away when necessary.\n* **Toughness/Durability:**  Remarkable mental and physical toughness, playing an entire season with a torn ACL and also having a previous ACL tear. Played through a thumb injury as well, showcasing a high pain tolerance.\n* **Mechanics:**  Clean two-step, three-step, and five-step drops.  Balanced setup, good ball security, and a quick, over-the-shoulder release.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **ACL Injuries:**  The twice-torn ACL is a major concern. While Dr. Bramel suggests isolated ACL tears shouldn't significantly impact athletic ability,  the long-term effects and risk of re-injury are substantial risks.\n* **Deep Ball Consistency:**  While he shows potential, deep ball accuracy needs further development and consistency.  His range seems to have been limited by the injury.\n* **Underestimating Coverage:**  Occasionally underestimates trail coverage on in-breaking routes, leading to incompletions or interceptions.  Can sometimes force throws into tight windows.\n* **Limited Mobility as a Scrambler:** Not a highly dynamic runner, though he effectively uses his legs to buy time and extend plays.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum (Trent Edwards – Joey Harrington/Josh Rosen - X – Brad Kaaya) highlights the range of potential outcomes.  This suggests he could be a developmental quarterback with a high ceiling but also a significant risk due to inconsistency and injury history.  Edwards represents a low-end possibility – a journeyman, while Harrington and Rosen could be considered higher-ceiling possibilities that ultimately fell short of expectations. Kaaya is another example of a prospect with traits but limited success in the NFL.  The \"X\" implies a potential outcome yet to be seen.  His potential is high, but realizing it hinges largely on his health and further refinement of his game.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nRourke is a high-risk, high-reward prospect.  His accuracy, pocket presence, and decision-making are impressive. However, his repeated ACL injuries significantly cloud his future. He projects as a late-round draft pick or even a priority free agent, needing time to develop and prove his durability.  His success depends heavily on his ability to stay healthy and continue to refine his game.\n"

How he’ll do it? Good luck.  \n \nThat’s the gist of Dart’s scouting report if you only have 10 seconds. Dart’s evaluation would scare me off him as an NFL decision-maker \nunless there’s an excellent veteran ahead of him and years to watch, learn, and work on his vertical game with the advice of players who \nalso had to work at it.  \n \nOtherwise, Dart’s game has a Jekyll-Hyde quality to it. His accuracy is solid-to-good in the shallow and intermediate zones. He can \nmaneuver well from pressure, and he’s a chain-moving runner who can buy time before opting to break the pocket.  \n \nDart’s accuracy wanes somewhere between 25-30 yards and beyond and become scattershot. He’s overthrowing, underthrowing, and \nbehind and ahead of targets.  \n \nThe scary part for me is that Dart’s setup, stance, and release lack any significant flaws beyond that his feet need to be undisturbed and \nnarrower to deliver with accuracy at a range of 30-45 yards. When forced to maneuver from pressure, Dart’s feet get too wide, and it leads \nto inaccuracies. \n \nFrom this standpoint, Dart must develop a strong skill for climbing the pocket where his footwork is precise. This could give him a chance to \novercome this specific symptom of his inaccuracies downfield.  \n \nI’m not a quarterback coach, so there could be subtler issues that hurt Dart’s downfield accuracy elsewhere, but from my perspective, \nDart’s accuracy relative to his mechanics reminds me of Jake Locker – a player who had decent mechanics but couldn’t deliver the ball with \nenough accuracy to thrive in the NFL.  \n \nDart should get matched with a West Coast Offense or scheme with a lot of Pistol and shotgun and with moving pockets off play-action and \nmisdirection throwbacks. If he’s forced to start early, which isn’t advisable, and has enough surrounding talent to keep him on schedule, \nDart might have enough success to buy time to develop his scattershot vertical game.   \n \nIt’s the ideal outcome for him and unlikely. Still, there are things working in Dart’s favor that could limit his need to throw downfield often.  \n \nDart can work through 2-3 reads during a play, legitimately seeing what’s in front of him with each of the progressions. He can work from \none sideline to the next before checking the ball to the outlet. He can do so before pressure arrives in the pocket.  \nDart can work through 2-3 progressions before pressure breaks down a pocket. He identifies pre-snap pressure—inside and outside—and he \nresponds effectively to interior pressure and edge pressure. He’s also effective against some forms of pressure where there are multiple \nplayers arriving at the same time from different points of the pocket. \nDart illustrates wise game management in the red zone. When a highly scripted play doesn’t have the post-snap numbers advantage with \nthe defense, Dart doesn’t target the receiver and eats the ball to keep the team in field-goal position.  \nDart protects his receivers in the short and intermediate range with the placement of throws way from the closest defender. He’ll throw the \nball away when pressure pins him to the boundary and he runs out of open options.  \nAs with most QB prospects, Dart can waste energy for short gains outside the pocket. This often happens when he has a clear opportunity \nto check the ball early on against coverage that has the advantage early and gain as much or more with less risk. There are also some \ngame management decisions based on down and distance that lack the savvy, Dart should attain with more experience and lesson’s learned \non the field.  \nDart’s pre-draft love feels more like a projection of what he can be than what his game currently is, but it’s not as bad of projection Zach \nWilson’s. It’s closer to Drew Lock and J.J. McCarthy. If the work ethic is there, success could be imminent. If it’s not, Dart may not finish his \nfirst contract as a starter.  \n \nDrops: Dart can open his frame to a side off a one-step drop. He has two-step and three-step drops that are well-defined. He’ll curtail the \nthree-step drop if pressure arrives too fast for him to set up in the pocket. Dart has some lapses with three-step drops where the footwork \npacing is fragmented, and it slows the timing of the delivery. This can inhibit accuracy against pressure.  \nDart’s five-step drop is well-defined and he can execute it as half-roll and quickly side-step edge pressure coming free to his roll-out side. \nHis seven-step drop has a slow pace and the steps lack uniformity—much like some of his five-step drops with specific reps—but he can also \nadjust the drop to slide away from interior pressure as he finishes the process.  \nBall Security: Dart carries the ball close to his chest as a runner and can take hit to the ball or ball-carrying arm when finishing downhill as \na runner. He carries the ball close to his chest when in the open field. His elbow can be a little tighter to his side, but it’s close enough to \nmake that adjustment easily.  \n\n \n70 \nDart can use either arm to carry the ball and has reps where he uses the left arm on a designed run to that side of the line, but he defaults \nto the right arm even when it’s not advisable.  \nPlay Fakes: Dart uses a variety of play fakes from Pistol and shotgun. His timing and extension of the ball are adequate. He can do more \nwith his upper body to sell the exchange. \nPump Fakes: Dart has a truncated pump fake as he rolls outside the pocket to manipulate pursuit. He also has an effective shoulder fake \nduring his drops. His pump fakes with half to three-quarter motion has moderate violence. He appears unconfident about using violence and \nmaintaining a grip on the ball.  \nRelease: Dart uses over-the-shoulder, sidearm, and three-quarter release motions. His drawback keeps the ball at the upper half of his \nchest and the ball is just behind his shoulder before coming forward.  \nThe midline of Dart’s back foot and front toe are aligned with his targets.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Dart can deliver the ball 54 yards off a three-step drop to the middle of the field, throwing the post with \nenough velocity to lead a receiver.  \nHe needs a clean pocket where his feet are undisturbed to have predictable pinpoint accuracy between 30-45 yards.  \nThat said, Dart has pinpoint accuracy and placement with middle of the field throws under 25 yards. He can layer the ball over two \nunderneath defenders in this range.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Dart buys time well enough that he doesn’t have to deliver off-platform with regularity. When pushed, he \ncan do what he does elsewhere – throw the ball with pinpoint accuracy within a range of 25-30 yards.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Dart’s shallow accuracy is stellar. His intermediate accuracy is a mix of pinpoint and catchable. The \nvertical game has some catchable targets, but that’s it.  \nMobile Accuracy: Most of Dart’s targets on the move were against pressure. His short- and intermediate accuracy was more \npinpoint than catchable. His vertical and deep accuracy were lacking.  \nDecision-Making: Dart can work through 2-3 reads during a play, legitimately seeing what’s in front of him with each of the \nprogressions. He can work from one sideline to the next before checking the ball to the outlet. He can do so before pressure arrives \nin the pocket.  \nDart illustrates wise game management in the red zone. When a highly scripted play doesn’t have the post-snap numbers \nadvantage with the defense, Dart doesn’t target the receiver and eats the ball to keep the team in field-goal position.  \nHe protects his receivers in the short and intermediate range with the placement of throws way from the closest defender  \nSense Pressure: Dart can work through 2-3 progressions before pressure breaks down a pocket. He identifies pre-snap pressure—inside \nand outside—and he responds effectively to interior pressure and edge pressure. He’s also effective against some forms of pressure where \nthere are multiple players arriving at the same time from different points of the pocket.  \nDart can be a step late to read a Green Dog blitz from the same side as an edge blitz and it costs him 1-2 steps to avoid it.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Dart climbs the pocket with hitches to work away from compressed edges of the pocket. He’ll also use a \nrunning climb as pressure dictates. He’s pinpoint at short ranges off that running climb. \nWhen Dart climbs from pressure, he can reduce the shoulder and pull through reaches from box defenders earning that pressure. He can \nalso bend that climb away from defenders that shed blocks and reach for him in that alley he’s climbing through.  \nDart sidesteps from interior pushes of guards that reach the pocket. He’ll also roll away from pressure. When necessary, Dart will stand and \ndeliver against interior pressure barreling down the chute to target the best option.  \nWhen Dart sidesteps pressure, his feet get too wide to generate optimal velocity and distance for targets over 25 yards and it reduces the \naccuracy to catchable, at best.  \n \n \n\n \n71 \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Dart can lead a receiver away from the boundary on sail routes when there’s a large enough hole in the \nCover 2 zone for Dart to do so.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: He was accurate in the short and intermediate range with a limited sample. \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: With a limited sample, Dart was pinpoint accurate in the short, intermediate, and vertical range. \nMobile Accuracy: Dart can deliver within the shallow zone while moving to his right and place the ball away from the defensive \nleverage to protect his receiver. He can deliver a pinpoint pass of 23 yards moving to his left to the boundary.  \nDecision-Making: Dart is considerate of placement to protect receivers. He’ll throw the ball away when pressure pins him to the \nboundary and he runs out of open options.  \nAs with most QB prospects, Dart can waste energy for short gains outside the pocket when he had a clear opportunity to check the \nball early against coverage that clearly had the advantage early and gain as much or more with less risk.  \nThere are reps where he rolls to one side of the pocket and he doesn’t throw the ball away when the edge defender on that side \ncuts him off. Instead, he attempts to work inside, it’s 3rd and short, and he’s too far from the line of scrimmage to try for the gain.  \nScrambling: Dart can avoid two points of pressure in the pocket and work in or outside the pocket to buy time. He can wait until defenders \nare 1-3 steps from him to begin evasive maneuvers. If the two points of pressure are coming from the same side or different points at the \nsame time, he has more difficulty choosing the best maneuver to avoid the pressure.  \nRunning: Dart will dive for the ground with a head-first slide to avoid hits in the open field. If he has more time, he’ll slide feet-first.  \nDart pulls through lower body reaches from linebackers once he’s through the pocket and he pulls through reaches from defensive tackles to \nhis pads while breaking the pocket. He has small jump cuts to slide from the inside shoulder to the outside shoulder of a blocker.  \nDart can deliver chain-moving gains as a runner and finish against safeties with his pads. He has enough curvilinear speed to bend around \nbox defenders and weave through traffic to earn yardage that didn’t appear available at first blush.  \nWhen he’s still in a scrambling mindset after he breaks the pocket, the ball can be loose and he doesn’t tuck the ball to his boundary arm. \nHe has lost the ball in a pivotal moment of the game because of this lax ball security.  \nDart only needs two steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway. This makes him more than capable of making force \ndefenders miss in the flat when he cuts inside and downhill.  \nHe can bounce and spin off a glancing shot to his pads in short yardage from a linebacker. He’ll drop his pads into a defensive back and \nbounce off. Using his throwing shoulder to do so is not the best idea. Probably better to slide, especially when up by 12 and there’s no \nreason not to protect himself.  \nDart is not a breakaway threat, but he’s better than a chain-mover as a runner. He’ll earn gains of 15-30 yards with his skills.  \nDurability: Meniscus surgery in late September of 2021 as a freshman at USC. Suffered the injury in the season opener and only played six \ngames—making three starts. Didn’t miss a game for the next three seasons.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If Dart’s draft-day value matched what I saw from him, I’d consider Dart in the third or fourth round of \nfantasy drafts. It’s likely Dart will earn a first or second-round selection in the NFL Draft. This could inflate his value in fantasy drafts.  \nThe landing spot must be compelling for me to consider him. Until we know, monitor from afar unless he drops to the last-half of the third \nround in a Superflex format.

        "analysis": "Jaxson Dart: QB Prospect Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Short-to-intermediate accuracy:** Dart demonstrates consistently good accuracy on throws within 25 yards, showing excellent placement to avoid defenders.  He excels in the short and intermediate areas, making him effective in quick-hitting passing schemes.\n* **Pocket mobility and maneuvering:** He effectively moves within the pocket to avoid pressure, utilizing hitches, climbs, and sidesteps. He's adept at navigating interior pressure and can extend plays.  His ability to climb the pocket is particularly noteworthy.\n* **Processing speed:** Dart can quickly read through progressions (2-3 reads), identifying pre-snap pressure and reacting effectively. He showcases good decision-making, particularly in the red zone, opting to throw away or eat the ball in unfavorable situations.  He's also good at working through multiple defenders and moving through progressions under pressure.\n* **Running ability:** Dart is a capable runner, adding a chain-moving element to his game and capable of bigger gains. He's effective at breaking tackles and using his agility to gain yards.  He shows decent curvilinear speed to navigate defenders.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Deep ball accuracy:**  Dart's biggest weakness is his inconsistent accuracy on throws beyond 25-30 yards. His throws become scattershot, with issues of overthrowing, underthrowing, and poor placement.  This is related to footwork inconsistencies when under pressure.\n* **Footwork under pressure:**  When pressured, Dart's feet often get too wide, hindering his accuracy and throwing mechanics. Developing precise footwork, particularly when climbing the pocket, is crucial for improvement.\n* **Game management:** While Dart shows flashes of excellent game management, he occasionally makes questionable decisions, such as unnecessarily extending plays or not checking down in obvious situations.  He needs to improve decision making in these situations and learn from his mistakes.\n* **Ball security while scrambling:**  While typically good with ball security, there are moments when his ball handling is loose while scrambling, leading to potential turnovers.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report draws several comparisons:\n\n* **Jake Plummer:**  The comparison highlights Dart's potential to be successful with excellent coaching and development, but also his potential to fall short if not properly developed, similar to Plummer.  The comparison focuses on accuracy issues related to mechanics.\n* **J.J. McCarthy:** This comparison emphasizes a similar developmental trajectory where raw talent and mobility are present, but refinement is needed.\n* **Drew Lock:**  This comparison points towards a player with some promising traits but inconsistencies that may lead to a boom-or-bust career.\n* **Zach Wilson:** This is mentioned as a *less negative* projection than Wilson's, implying that Dart has a higher chance of success than Wilson had coming out of college.  The lack of immediate accuracy is common to both.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nDart possesses significant potential as a dual-threat quarterback, but his deep ball accuracy needs serious improvement. His success in the NFL hinges on his ability to refine his footwork under pressure and consistently deliver the ball accurately downfield. The right offensive scheme and coaching staff will be critical for his development.  He projects as a high-risk, high-reward prospect.\n"

He’s a good athlete with a big arm and vertical-range potential as a passer from the pocket or on \nthe move.  \n\n \n74 \n \nThe highlights will get many excited because Shough has some speed as a runner, he makes some impressive throws from a variety of arm \nslots, and he can do it on the move. Squint hard enough and you’ll see some of the things that made Jay Cutler a compelling prospect early \nin his career. \n \nRight now, that potential is a projection more than a reality. Shough’s vertical and deep accuracy is catchable a lot more often than it is \npinpoint. His arm slots influence this dip in accuracy. When forced to place air under the ball from an off-balanced platform on a deep \ntarget, he should be leading the target away from the deep safety. \nMore important than his arm talent is the gaps with Shough’s decision-making. He must improve his recognition of early opportunities the \ndefense shows, opportunities that are superior to the predetermined decisions he chooses. \n \nShough’s manipulation of the Cover 3 safety must be savvier. He tips off the defender because he’s staring down the safety rather than \nlooking to the opposite side of the field if not influence the defender to slide opposite the intended route.  \nHe can also be 1-2 steps late with executing the viable decision he identifies at the right time, but lacks the confidence to trust with \npressure arriving. This leads to throwing the ball in the middle of the field from an off-platform position and under pressure to a target that \nis no longer open.  \nShough’s lateness as a decision maker can also lead to him taking sacks he could have avoided. He must have heightened awareness and \nexecution in game situations where he’s in the opponent’s territory late in the third quarter and down multiple scores.  \nIt also led to Shough throwing the ball away, but near the receiver he could have hit 1-2 steps earlier. This is the type of slow processing \nthat limited Alex Smith for the length of his career. \nShough’s black-zone management – working inside your own team’s 20 – is lacking. He puts his team at risk with decisions that could alter \nthe outcome of the game. He’s too aggressive.  \nThose are the negatives. There are positives worth highlighting, because he could contribute early and develop into a successful player in a \ngood setting.  \nShough will hold the Cover 1 safety in the middle of the field during his three-step drop to set up his throw to the go route up the near \nsideline against man-to—man coverage. He’ll also look to one side, hold the opposite side safety and linebackers and then come back to the \noriginal side so he has manipulated space for his throw.  \nShough will check the ball to his back if he’s in the pocket long enough to see a flash of potential pressure and his first two reads aren’t \navailable downfield.  \nShough reads the high safety pre-snap and identifies the other safety working downhill vs the read and understand how to place the slant \naway from the S sliding across the defend—creating an easier opportunity to catch the ball and earn yardage after the catch.  \nWhen Shough buys time outside the pocket, he can patiently allow a slow-developing deep crosser to work its way to his side and place the \nball only where the receiver has a chance to earn the ball.  \nWhen working against Cover 2, Shough can deliver to the opposite boundary with an intermediate target and place the ball so he isn’t \nleading the receiver into the safety. This is one of multiple good examples of Shough showing awareness and caution with the ancillary \ndefender in man or zone coverage. \nShough displays some effective front side to backside reading of the redzone under pressure and quickly come off the front side look to the \nbackside looks.  \nShough has shown some wisdom to take a sack in a scenario where he comes off a first read to the boundary, turns to the opposite hash \nfor the check-down, but interior pressure is leaping unblocked and high into the passing lane as he begins his release.  \nHe can truncate the release into a pump fake and then spin away from defender’s initial angle. Although sacked, Shough bought the \npossibility of additional time and didn’t have a pass deflected. I’ve seen Shough do this multiple times while studying his tape and he \naverted potential, if not likely, disaster.  \nAs you can see, there’s some coverage awareness and game-management strengths with Shough’s work. The greatest concern might be \none that’s isolated to specific scenarios that it might be hidden to the many touting him: His pocket management.  \nShough does nice work from the pocket in enough instances to earn high marks. He can wait until interior pressure and/or edge pressure is \n1-2 steps from him before sidestepping, flushing, or rolling away from it. Shough can sidestep interior pressure and then break the pocket.   \n\n \n75 \nHe’ll climb edge pressure and then flush from the pocket when he senses the pressure. He can reduce a shoulder from edge pressure and \nsidestep it. He can do all three in succession to avoid edge pressure and find an open option downfield as he rolls to his right.  \nShough can even climb and deliver accurately in the short range of the field. He can pump and spin when interior pressure is in his face. \nThe problems with edge pressure and early pressure are a concern. Shough must learn that sidestepping edge pressure to the left and \ntrying to power the football to the right on a deep post can lead to inaccurate placement and give a safety time to adjust his position and \ncut off the target. If he’s going to make these throws, he must lead the receiver away from the safety.  \nHe can be reactive to pressure that arrives fast and the result of the reactivity is that Shough doesn’t follow through with his feet during his \nrelease. It can impact his accuracy.  \nShough must demonstrate that he’s willing to take a hit to throw the ball on time. He will take a hit to throw the ball away. He’ll also take a \nhit as he throws on the move and/or off-platform.  \nShough has shown difficulty sensing blindside edge pressure on deep drops. Shough misses that he has room to climb the pocket past the \nedge pressure, but he doesn’t sense it or accelerate his pace of play.   \nHis pocket clock against edge pressure may also need work. This appears to be the case based on his decision-making vs. pressure (see \nbelow).  \nHe’s better at edge pressure on the play side. He senses it on time, reduces his shoulder, climbs, and flushes into a rollout.  \nShough has a better pocket clock in the red zone than he does in other places on the field, but he has lapses there, too. He can climb \nunnecessarily after seeing the wide-open man and Shough only needed to step into a throw. Instead, climbs two extra steps and never gets \nthe ball out.  \nFixing pocket management woes are difficult, especially when pressure related. It’s impossible for teams to limit a quarterback’s exposure \nto pressure. It’s a reality of the NFL.  \nConsidering the nature of his problems, you can bet that Shough will still earn an opportunity if his NFL draft capital is inside the fifth round. \nShough demonstrates enough against pressure that most won’t notice where his pocket work fails him – and it’s an isolated, but chronic \nissue.  \nIf he overcomes it, Shough has the tools to continue developing into a future starter. If not, he can still have a chance to become a \ncompelling journeyman back up with opportunities to play and produce.   \nDrops: Shough executes well-paced and spaced 3- and 5-step drops from pistol and shotgun. Shough also delivers a one- or two-step drop \nand set from Pistol off a pitch or play fake. He can adjust the pacing of his drop based on pre-snap pressure.  \nShough has a seven-step drop from center. The steps and pacing can be cleaner and quicker. While he can be more fluid from center with \nhis drops and play fakes, Shough can execute three-step and five-step drops from center.  \nBall Security: Shough drops with both hands on the ball. When breaking the pocket, he begins with the ball close to his chest, but he \nswings the ball away from his chest and his side when sprinting downhill. He has lost the ball because he made it vulnerable to a chop.  \nPlay Fakes: Shough delivers read-option fakes and pitch fakes from shotgun and Pistol. Shough has a good turn and extension on a play \nfake accompanying a seven-step drop from center.  \nThe simulation of the exchange can be more pronounced and accurate. He has two-handed and one-handed fakes and fakes where he turns \nhis back to the defense. The exchange lacks variation of intensity with the extension or selling with the body.  \nPump Fakes: When sprinting right, Shough delivers minor and moderate pump fakes in terms of range of motion and violence. From the \npocket, Shough delivers pump fakes ranging from a shoulder fake with a small amount of motion with the ball, to a pump fake with \nmoderate motion.  \nRelease: Shough’s release can be tighter. The ball dips to the numbers on his jersey and far enough behind his frame that he has room to \nabbreviate the motion. He brings the ball up just behind his shoulder and this portion of the release is efficient. The ball comes out over his \nshoulder.  \nShough also has a sidearm release where he has shown accuracy under pressure and off-platform while layering the ball over and between \ndefenders. He can throw the ball sidearm and off-balance, but his placement dips from pinpoint to general accuracy and the general \naccuracy can favor the position of the man-to-man defender playing tight too the receiver.  \n\n \n76 \nShough’s feet don’t adjust precisely enough with the fade away. The midline of the back foot and front toe are pointed to where the receiver \nis relative to throw rather than where the receiver will be. This leads to the ball arriving behind the break path and closer to the trailing \ndefender.  \nThere’s some lower-body torque. The midline of the back foot at front toe are aligned with the break path of the target.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure)  \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Shough displays pinpoint placement against man-to-man coverage on corner fades 28 yards from the \npitch point. There’s enough air under the ball for the receiver to work under the target and go airborne to earn the target.  \nShough can deliver a 44-yard throw with pinpoint accuracy up the near-side boundary on a go route. He has general accuracy onto \nthe frame of a receiver on a 23-yard dig route. He’s accurate between the C3 LB dropping from the shallow boundary and the C3 \nCB playing over the top of the receiver at the boundary—dropping the ball into the receiver in stride up the sideline at 25 yards \nfrom the pitch point.  \nShough can deliver the ball 52 yards from the pitch with general accuracy against C3 up the near sideline.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Shough moves well enough to limit the need for off-platform work. He has shown pinpoint potential in \nthe intermediate ranges.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Shough has the arm and placement to deliver a sideline fade from the opposite hash covering 43 yards \nwith general accuracy—leading the receiver under the ball.  \nMobile Accuracy: Shough has general accuracy at 25 yards to the near-side boundary while moving to his right.   \nDecision-Making: Shough will hold the C1 safety in the middle of the field during his three-step drop to set up his throw to the go \nroute up the near sideline against man-to—man coverage. He’ll also look to one side, hold the opposite side safety and linebackers \nand then come back to the original side so he has manipulated space for his throw.  \nShough will check the ball to his back if he’s in the pocket long enough to see a flash of potential pressure and his first two reads \naren’t available downfield.  \nShough reads the high safety pre-snap and identifies the other safety working downhill vs the read and understand how to place \nthe slant away from the S sliding across the defend—creating an easier opportunity to catch the ball and earn yardage after the \ncatch.  \nWhen Shough buys time outside the pocket, he can patiently allow a slow-developing deep crosser to work its way to his side and \nplace the ball only where the receiver has a chance to earn the ball.  \nWhen working against Cover 2, Shough can deliver to the opposite boundary 23 yards from the pitch point and place the ball so he \nisn’t leading the receiver into the safety. This is one of multiple good examples of Shough showing awareness caution with the \nancillary defender in man or zone coverage. \nHis manipulation of the C3 safety must be savvier. He tips off the defender because he’s staring down the safety rather than \nlooking to the opposite side of the field if not influence the defender to slide opposite the intended route.  \nSense Pressure: Shough must demonstrate that he’s willing to take a hit to throw the ball on time. He will take a hit to throw the ball \naway. He’ll also take a hit as he throws on the move and/or off-platform.  \nShough has shown difficulty sensing blindside edge pressure on a seven-step drop. When sacked in the late third quarter against Notre \nDame, Shough had room to climb the pocket past the edge pressure, but he didn’t sense it and took a sack in Notre Dame’s territory 2nd \nand 8 while down 10 points.  \nIn the same game, Shough saw play-side edge pressure but didn’t accelerate the pace of his play. He took a hit trying to throw a check-\ndown that he had time to deliver sooner or time to break the pocket and run.   \nHis pocket clock against edge pressure may also need work if he sensed the edge pressure. This appears to be the case based on his \ndecision-making vs. pressure (see below). If blindside edge pressure is coming from the same side as his initial reads downfield, he can spot \nit.  \nHe’s better at edge pressure on the play side. He senses it on time, reduces his shoulder, climbs, and flushes into a rollout.  \nHe has a better pocket clock in the red zone than he does in other places on the field, but has lapses there, too. He can climb unnecessarily \nafter seeing the wide-open man and Shough only needed to step into a throw. Instead, climbs two extra steps and never gets the ball out.  \n\n \n77 \nManeuvering From Pressure He can wait until interior pressure and/or edge pressure is 1-2 steps from him before sidestepping, flushing, \nor rolling away from it. Shough can sidestep interior pressure and then break the pocket.   \nHe’ll climb edge pressure and then flush from the pocket when he senses the pressure. He can reduce a shoulder from edge pressure and \nsidestep it. He can do all three in succession to avoid edge pressure and find an open option downfield as he rolls to his right.  \nShough can climb and deliver accurately in the short range of the field. He can pump and spin when interior pressure is in his face.  \nHe must learn that sidestepping edge pressure to the left and trying to power the football to the right on a deep post can lead to inaccurate \nplacement and give a safety time to adjust his position and cut off the target. If he’s going to make these throws, he must lead the receiver \naway from the safety.  \nHe can be reactive to pressure that arrives fast and the result of the reactivity is that Shough doesn’t follow through with his feet during his \nrelease. It can impact his accuracy.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Shough’s feet freeze against interior pressure and he tries to make throws outside where his feet are \nparallel to each other and not in position to drive the ball. This leads to off platform attempts that sail or sink.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Shough also has a sidearm release where he has shown accuracy under pressure and off-platform while \nlayering the ball over and between defenders at a distance of 20 yards and only where the receiver can earn the ball.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Shough has shown pinpoint potential in the short, intermediate, and deep ranges of the field.  \nMobile Accuracy: He can deliver the ball with pinpoint accuracy and layering it over and between defenders at a range of 20 \nyards moving to his left and throwing off-platform and off-balance with pressure in his face.  \nHe can display better placement at the intermediate boundary so his receiver can set his position at the sideline and then attack \nthe ball away from an oncoming defender.  \nShough has no worse than general accuracy in the intermediate range while moving to his left—on or off-platform.  \nShough has chances to deliver a target on-time with pressure coming and take a hit, but he’ll react to the pressure  rather than \nthrow the ball and this leads to sacks.   \nDecision-Making: He has plays where he predetermines throws and forgoes the easiest solution. For instance, against a T-E twist, \nShough will see the linebackers and safeties taking deep drops and leaving a lot of room underneath for the running back circling \nout of the backfield to the middle of the field.  \nThe back is breaking at the same depth as Shough’s predetermined read to the opposite flat. Instead of targeting this back who is \ndirectly in his sightline during the drop, Shough delivers the opposite-field out that requires a more challenging late turn and throw \nfrom Shough and the ball takes more time to reach the receiver and gives the defense more time to recover space.  \nWhen sprinting out under pressure, Shough does well to look for an open option. If that option isn’t open and a defender is closing, \nit’s best to target the deeper boundary route with a throw out of bounds. Instead, Shough considers a cross-body throw with two \ndefenders in position to defend the target and pressure closing. By the time he pulls the ball down with a second pump fake, the \ndefender is on top of him and sacking.  \nWhen staying in the pocket under pressure, Shough is not as resistant to throwing the ball away. He ‘ll do it as needed when \nreceivers don’t break open and pressure is bearing down.  \nShough can be 1-2 steps late with executing the decision he sees but lacked the confidence to trust with pressure arriving. This \nleads to throwing the ball in the middle of the field from an off-platform position under pressure to a target that is no longer open, \nor throwing the ball away, but near the receiver he could have hit 1-2 steps earlier.  \nHis black-zone management – working inside your team’s 20 – with a seven-point lead in the second half of the game is lacking. \nHe puts his team at risk with decisions that could alter the outcome of the game. He’s too aggressive.  \nShough’s lateness as a decision maker can also lead to him taking sacks he could have avoided. He must have heightened \nawareness and execution in game situations where he’s in the opponent’s territory late in the third quarterback and down multiple \nscores.  \nWhen forced to place air under the ball from an off-balanced platform on a deep target, he should be leading the target away from \nthe deep safety.  \n\n \n78 \nShough displays some effective front side to backside reading of the redzone under pressure and quickly come off the front side \nlook to the backside looks.  \nShough has shown some wisdom to take a sack in a scenario where he comes off a first read to the boundary, turns to the \nopposite hash for the check-down, but interior pressure is leaping unblocked and high into the passing lane as he begins his \nrelease.  \nHe can truncate the release into a pump fake and then spin away from defender’s initial angle. Although sacked, Shough bought \nthe possibility of additional time and didn’t have a pass deflected. I’ve seen Shough do this multiple times while studying his tape \nand he averted potential, if not likely, disaster.  \nScrambling: Shough will spin, flush, or roll from pressure. He’s much better at identifying and acting on pressure when it’s interior \npressure. He’s late to act, if even sense, edge pressure. When he does, he will extend plays inside or outside. He can split bookend \npressure.  \nRunning: Shough has the acceleration to reach the secondary and separate from linebackers. He has the speed to hold off safeties and \ncorners on the same side of the field for 40 yards. A cornerback will run him down.  \nHe can work through reaches to his legs and extend gains. Shough slides to end his runs when there’s pursuit over the top.  \nIn the red zone, Shough will dive-roll over a defender to reach the end zone. If the defender blocks the goal line, Shough will drop his pads \nand attempt to spin off the contact.  \nDurability: Missed all but four starts in 2021 due to a broken left collarbone. Appeared in seven games in 2022 but missed the rest due to \nshoulder surgery after re-injuring the collarbone. Season-ending leg injury in 2023 – broken fibula—in his fourth appearance.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you can get Shough in the fifth or sixth round of fantasy drafts for a roster with 40-plus spots and a \npractice squad, or a Superflex format with at least 25-30 spots he’s worth consideration. Otherwise, monitor from afar until you see if the \nNFL awards Shough draft capital commensurate with an early opportunity to start in his first or second year.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBack-shoulder fade to the corner of 28 yards pinpoint \n• \nPredetermined more difficult throw when he had an easier wide-open target \n• \nProcessing adequate, but confidence in what he saw to execute on time was lacking \n• \nOff-platform vs. pressure moving left and between and over defenders for TD \n• \nFade opposite boundary, 43 yards, placement \n• \nSlow decision-making and takes sack \n• \nGame management missing \n• \n37-yard opposite sideline TD \n• \nClimbs and flushes pressure but black-zone management lacking \n• \nDrop footwork inefficiency and wasted step confirming open man – red-zone sack \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n79",

It sounds like a slight, but Howard has some under the radar \ntalents that could make his game sing. \n \nHoward has a good foundation with his drops, play fakes, pump fakes, and release mechanics. Only small tweaks are necessary for Howard \nto refine these parts of his game.  \n \nArm strength is an asset. He can stretch the field in the vertical game, and Howard has a good feel for when he can toss the ball and allow a \nwide-open vertical option to trot under it without getting too fine with placement.  \nHoward’s mobility is also a strength of his game. He can abandon the pocket and turn the corner on linebackers. Howard has the balance to \nbounce off glancing shots from defensive backs and pull through reaches from most defenders.  \nAs a decision maker, Howard’s game is a mixed bag but salvageable. He has the confidence in his velocity to deliver an opposite boundary \nthrow between a tight window of Cover 2. His confidence borders on arrogance, and it may translate that way in similar situations in the \nNFL. It may require him to revise his perceived limitations of what he can/can’t attempt.  \nAs mentioned about his opposite-hash accuracy, Howard can target windows that may prove too tight for the NFL or target leverage that’s \nmore favorable for an NFL defender than what he’s targeting successfully in college. He errs on getting the ball out against less favorable \nleverage even when there’s a long-developing drop that gives him time to pivot to the opposite field for a check-down with a lot of wide-\nopen space.  \nHoward will work through two reads, sense the beginnings of pressure, and climb the pocket on the run to earn yardage downfield. He can \nalso cycle through 1-2 reads and find the check-down in a timely manner. When he is making a throw off his first read and from a clean \npocket, he accounts for a periphery defender. \nThere’s enough here for Howard to develop into a capable backup. If a team expects Howard’s game to sing, he has some conceptual \nweaknesses to address.  \nOne of his biggest as a coverage reader is attacking routes where the defender is squatting over the top. With quick-hitting screens to the \nopposite flat, Howard can lose track of defenders squatting on the throwing lane and give interceptions—including pick-sixes.  \nHe has lapses with reading the field where he executes a deeper drop of five or seven steps. Howard makes two reads and has enough time \nto pivot to the opposite side of the field to deliver a check-down into wide open space.  \nThis doesn’t happen. Instead, he gets greedy with a second read that’s covered and tries to break the pocket to work a scramble drill \ndownfield with a prohibitive throw.  \nHoward must also show more awareness of underneath zone defenders on intermediate routes in the middle off the field. Either he doesn’t \nsee them or he doesn’t sufficiently layer the throw over the defender.  \nHoward will check the ball down in timely fashion after making three reads and feeling blindside pressure. As is the case with most young \nquarterbacks, Howard doesn’t see the shallow defender peripheral to the target peel off his route, before Howard begins his release, to \nattack downfield and undercut Howard’s intended target. This is something even veteran quarterbacks have difficulty spotting.  \nHoward also has difficulty accurately gauging linebackers dropping into the intermediate range and undercutting his targets. He sees the \ndrop before he begins his release, but doesn’t layer the ball effectively. He’s been picked off due to this and he’s had several close calls.  \nHoward uses his eyes to hold the linebackers to the shallow in-cut and wait for his deeper route to break behind them before pivoting late \nand delivering the ball under pressure to the open man breaking past the coverage into the middle of the field. This is good patience with \nallowing his receiver to clear the zone coverage.  \nWhen Howard feels the pocket compressing after recovering a low snap and the coverage is playing at depth against his receivers running \nintermediate/vertical routes, Howard will throw the ball away. It’s not a common sight with his game—2.5 games before I saw him do so. \nTo be fair, there weren’t but 1-2 scenarios where throwing the ball away was a valid option.  \nHoward can deliver intermediate routes with more anticipation. He begins his release as the receiver is exiting his break instead of entering \nthe break. This allows defenders more time to recover to the receiver and the ball.  \nHoward also attempts throws with pressure in his face where he can’t step into the throw with a target in the middle of the field with a tight \ntriangle of defenders in the area. Inaccurate passes lead to potential turnovers. Howard has delivered errant throws that led to dropped \ninterceptions.  \n\n \n81 \nHoward will take off from interior pressure that is 2-3 steps from him in the pocket. He has a good feel for blindside pressure after making \n2-3 reads in the pocket. He identifies post-snap pressure – interior and edge. He also spots box pressure pre-snap that will come from the \ninside or edge. He has had some success identifying DB pressure of the edge or split from the box.  \nWhen breaking the pocket, Howard will climb on the run. He can deliver the ball while throwing on the run to climb edge pressure. \nHoward can also hitch to climb from edge pressure. He’ll sidestep pressure up the middle to access an open passing lane. He’ll also flush \ninside edge pressure and outside the pocket.  \nHoward can freeze an unblocked blitzer with a stop-start move at the top of a seven-step drop with a half roll. He sets up downhill, and then \nreduces the shoulder from the reach of the defender and rolls away from the reach off the defender.   \nIf Howard can improve his leverage reads and know which defenders to keep track of during a play, he could become a competent reserve \nwith the athletic upside to produce when called upon. If he can become an excellent game manager and quell is arrogance with his arm, he \nmight have a shot to start.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? Howard has developed more nuance with selling the exchange with his play-action.  \nDrops: Howard drops into a balanced stance with one-, two-, and three-step footwork. He can vary the pacing of his five-step drops. \nHoward has an effective seven-step drop from center. He also has a half-roll of seven steps from center.  \nHoward does a good job opening his frame to a receiver’s side during a drop to manipulate the defense.  \nBall Security: Howard holds the ball with both hands at the top of his drops and with throws at come out within the designed rhythm of the \nplay.  \nWhen breaking the pocket, Howard tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm and tight to his chest. His elbow is loose from his frame. He can \ntake a hit to the ball from blindside pressure.  \nPlay Fakes: Howard extends the ball with good timing when executing read fakes. He has reps where he can sell the exchange much more \nthan he does. When he sells the exchange, he turns his pads through the exchange point and has enough bend with his knees and torso to \nmake it believable.  \nHe uses a two-handed full-extension play fake on a seven-step drop from center. He turns his back to the defense during the final half of his \ndrop. There can be more bend with his legs and frame to sell the exchange during the fake. \nHoward’s pitch fake has good heft at the top of the fake when he extends his arms. He can use the free hand to simulate an exchange when \nworking from Pistol.  \nAs the season progressed, Howard’s sale of the exchange had more nuance and detail by the end of the year compared to the beginning \nand middle.  \nPump Fakes: Howard has a full-motion pump fake with moderate violence. His shoulder fakes need more motion. It looks like a faint \nmuscle spasm or twitch.  \nRelease: Howard begins his release with the midline of his back foot aligned with the target. His draw back is compact and the ball comes \nover his shoulder during the release. Howard can truncate the drawback for quick flicks to the shallow flat.  \nHis front toe is aligned with the target. There can be more activation of his hips to generate additional torque.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Howard must show more awareness of underneath zone defenders on intermediate routes in the middle \noff the field. Either he doesn’t see them or he doesn’t sufficiently layer the throw over the defender.  \nHoward has catchable accuracy at a range of 54 yards. If a receiver gets behind the secondary early, Howard can either lead the \nreceiver deep or get the ball far enough that the receiver can wait on it without risk of a DB recovering fast enough to defend the \nball.  \nHoward has a good feel for when he can toss the ball and allow a wide-open vertical option to trot under it without getting too fine \nwith placement.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Howard has potential with pinpoint accuracy in the shallow and intermediate ranges of the field.  \n\n \n82 \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Howard has the confidence in his velocity to deliver an opposite boundary throw between a tight \nwindow of Cover 2. His confidence borders on arrogance and it may translate that way in similar situations in the NFL, which may \nrequire him to revise his perceived limitations of what he can/can’t attempt.  \nHoward has the range to throw the ball 50-55 yards to the opposite flat or boundary. He’s pinpoint against tight man coverage at \n27 yards from his release point to the opposite boundary.  \nHoward displays good touch and placement off a quick setup to deliver the corner fade to the opposite boundary.  \nMobile Accuracy: He has a pinpoint range of 25 yards moving to his right and 15 yards moving to his left.  \nDecision-Making: Howard will work through two reads, sense the beginnings of pressure, and climb the pocket on the run to earn \nyardage downfield. He can also cycle through 1-2 reads and find the check-down in a timely manner. \nAs mentioned about his opposite-hash accuracy, Howard can target windows that may prove too tight for the NFL or target \nleverage that’s more favorable for an NFL defender than what he’s targeting successfully in college. He errs on getting the ball out \nagainst less favorable leverage even when there’s a long-developing drop that gives him time to pivot to the opposite field for a \ncheck-down with a lot of wide-open space.  \nWhen he is making a throw off his first read and from a clean pocket, he accounts for a periphery defender. \nOne of his biggest conceptual weaknesses as a coverage reader is attacking routes where the defender is squatting over the top.  \nWith quick-hitting screens to the opposite flat, Howard can lose track of defenders squatting on the throwing lane and give \ninterceptions—including pick-sixes.  \nHe has lapses with reading the field where he executes a deeper drop of five or seven steps, makes two reads and has enough time \nto pivot to the opposite side of the field to deliver a check-down into wide open space. Instead, he gets greedy with a second read \nthat’s covered and tries to break the pocket to work a scramble drill downfield with a prohibitive throw.  \nSense Pressure: Howard will take off from interior pressure that is 2-3 steps from him in the pocket. He has a good feel for blindside \npressure after making 2-3 reads in the pocket. He identifies post-snap pressure – interior and edge. He also spots box pressure pre-snap \nthat will come from the inside or edge. He has had some success identifying DB pressure of the edge or split from the box.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: When breaking the pocket, Howard will climb on the run. He can deliver the ball 18 yards from the pitch \nwhile throwing on the run to climb edge pressure. \nHoward can also hitch to climb from edge pressure. He’ll sidestep pressure up the middle to access an open passing lane. He’ll also flush \ninside edge pressure and outside the pocket.  \nHoward can freeze an unblocked blitzer with a stop-start move at the top of a seven-step drop with a half roll. He sets up downhill, and then \nreduces the shoulder from the reach of the defender and rolls away from the reach off the defender.   \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Howard has potential with pinpoint accuracy in the shallow and intermediate ranges of the field.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Howard can throw on the retreat off his back foot with pressure in his face and deliver to the near-flat 21 \nyards from the release point with pinpoint accuracy.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Howard can deliver a pinpoint-accurate curl to the opposite boundary traveling 15 yards from the \nrelease point with a defender hitting him during the release.  \nMobile Accuracy: Howard can throw on the retreat off his back foot with pressure in his face and deliver to the near-flat 21 yards \nfrom the release point with pinpoint accuracy. Howard can deliver moving to his left with pressure in his face with a pinpoint range \nof 26 yards.  \nDecision-Making: Howard will check the ball down in timely fashion after making three reads and feeling blindside pressure. As is \nthe case with most young quarterbacks, Howard doesn’t see the shallow defender peripheral to the target peel off his route, before \nHoward begins his release, to attack downfield and undercut Howard’s intended target. This is something even veteran \nquarterbacks have difficulty spotting.  \nHoward also has difficulty accurately gauging linebackers dropping into the intermediate range and undercutting his targets. He \nsees the drop before he begins his release, but doesn’t layer the ball effectively. He’s been picked off due to this and he’s had \nseveral close calls.  \n\n \n83 \nHoward uses his eyes to hold the linebackers to the shallow in-cut and wait for his deeper route to break behind them before \npivoting late and delivering the ball under pressure to the open man breaking past the coverage into the middle of the field. This is \ngood patience with allowing his receiver to clear the zone coverage.  \nWhen Howard feels the pocket compressing after recovering a low snap and the coverage is playing at depth against his receivers \nrunning intermediate/vertical routes, Howard will throw the ball away. It’s not a common sight with his game—2.5 games before I \nsaw him do so. To be fair there weren’t but 1-2 scenarios where throwing the ball away was a valid option.  \nHoward can deliver intermediate routes with more anticipation. He begins his release as the receiver is exiting his break instead of \nentering the break. This allows defenders more time to recover to the receiver and the ball.  \nHoward also attempts throws with pressure in his face where he can’t step into the throw with a target in the middle of the field \nwith a tight triangle of defenders in the area. Inaccurate passes lead to potential turnovers. Howard has delivered errant throws \nthat led to dropped interceptions.  \nScrambling: Howard can avoid one point of pressure and extend plays inside or outside the pocket.  \nRunning: Howard can earn chain-moving gains when breaking the pocket. When he encounters a defensive back, Howard can slide feet \nfirst, but he must slide more often, feet-first, rather than torso-first. He barrels shoulder and/or chest-first into the opponent.  \nHoward has enough acceleration to beat box defenders around the far-side edge and turn the corner on them long enough to earn a chain \nmoving gain of 8-12 yards. He can nearly turn the corner without a stiff arm on a corner back at the far-side edge. The stiff arm helps him \nward off a reach. He can turn the corner on a near-side safety on a designed run to the short-side boundary.  \nHe also has the balance to bounce off glancing shots from defensive backs and pull through reaches from most defenders.  \nDurability: Howard has not missed significant time during his five-year career.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Howard is worth a stab in the second half of a Superflex format before the NFL determines Howard’s draft \ncapital. Otherwise, he’s best as a late-round consideration in only the deepest formats.  \nMonitor from afar in most leagues.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nUnjustified confidence/arrogance against unfavorable leverage and tight zone windows \n• \nPocket clock and check-down after three timely reads \n• \nQuick setup and throw with placement and touch on the corner fade \n• \nOpposite-boundary tight coverage pinpoint at 27 yards from the release \n• \nSidesteps interior push and consecutive pump fakes to manipulate flat defender \n• \n53-yard go-route from the release point and pinpoint accurate \n• \nToo aggressive against DBs squatting on routes \n• \nManipulation and patience vs. zone with throw vs. pressure \n• \nMore misadventures with DB leverage he should avoid \n• \nHoward vs. LB drop leads to INT \n• \nPinpoint at 26 yards while sliding to his left from pressure \n• \nImproved detail with play-action as season progressed \n• \nSlide, climb, and throw in rhythm vs C4 defender on third down \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n84",
        "analysis": "Will Howard is a quarterback prospect with a unique blend of strengths and weaknesses.  His profile suggests a player with high potential but also significant areas needing improvement before becoming a reliable NFL starter.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Arm Strength and Accuracy:** Possesses strong arm talent capable of stretching the field vertically.  Shows pinpoint accuracy on short to intermediate throws, particularly to the opposite hash, even under pressure.  Good touch and placement on deeper throws when given time.\n* **Mobility:**  A surprisingly mobile quarterback who can extend plays with his legs, evade pressure, and make throws on the run.  He's effective at climbing the pocket and escaping pressure.  Shows good balance and ability to absorb hits.\n* **Mechanics:**  Solid fundamentals in drops, play-fakes, pump-fakes, and release mechanics, requiring only minor refinements.  He shows improved play-action selling over the course of his college career.\n* **Pressure Awareness:**  Identifies pre- and post-snap pressure effectively, demonstrating an ability to escape the pocket or make quick, accurate throws under pressure.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:**  Prone to making poor decisions, particularly under pressure or when targeting tight windows. Shows a tendency towards \"hero ball\" plays, disregarding safer check-down options.  He needs to improve his anticipation on intermediate routes and better assess underneath zone defenders.\n* **Coverage Reading:**  Struggles to read coverage effectively, leading to interceptions, especially when defenders are squatting over routes.  He needs to improve his ability to identify and avoid unfavorable leverage situations.\n* **Ball Security:** While generally secure, his aggressive play style and decision-making lead to occasional turnovers.\n* **Consistency:** While showing flashes of brilliance, his performance isn't consistently high-level.  He needs to eliminate erratic throws and improve his consistency in reading the field.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum of Josh Allen/Andrew Luck – X – Tim Tebow – Bryce Petty highlights the wide range of potential outcomes.  He has the arm talent and athleticism reminiscent of Josh Allen, but his decision-making currently leans more towards the inconsistent nature of Bryce Petty or even the reckless tendencies of Tim Tebow.  The \"X\" suggests he doesn't perfectly align with any of these players, but his ceiling is potentially high like Allen or Luck if he improves his decision-making and accuracy.  Ultimately, he needs to minimize the negative aspects of the comparison to be successful.  He needs coaching and refinement to reach his ceiling, possibly even falling short of a backup role.\n"

His recruiting profile, career with a Division-I powerhouse, and solid fundamentals could earn Ewers NFL Draft capital \nthat paves the way to an opportunity to start during his rookie contract.  \n \nEwers has good drops, ball fakes, and competent release mechanics. His arm talent and accuracy are at their best in the shallow, \nintermediate, and vertical ranges of the field. A lot of targets in the deepest stretches beyond 42 yards from Ewers’ release point are \nlacking.  \n \nStill, a competent vertical game between 28-42 yards is enough for NFL quarterbacks. Matt Ryan won a lot of games with a range of \naccuracy that waned between 40-45 yards and deeper.  \n \nEwers holds the C3 high safety during his drop and turns to the primary receiver at the top of the drop. He makes a quick decision based on \nthe route design and the defender’s leverage at the top of the stem.  \nEwers can improve his placement with the fade against C3, placing the ball closer to the boundary so the receiver at the numbers can work \naway from the C3 safety instead of being led where the safety has an enhanced opportunity to defend the target.  \nEwers displays some awareness with his placement against peripheral coverage, but the placement has room for improvement so there’s \ncomplete protection from the defender rather than partial protection. He’s much better at accounting for the middle of the field defender in \nthe shallow zones.  \nThis accounting for defenders isn’t as accurate when Ewers is checking down after two reads downfield and the timeline to see the \nperipheral defender is shorter. When it’s one read, he can see flat defenders peeling downfield and opt to throw a deeper target out of \nbounds because of the legitimate threat for the flat or shallow boundary defender to undercut the target.  \nEwers has lapses where he’s not patient enough to see if the C2 cornerback continues trailing the outside receiver or if he peels off that \nreceiver and helps with covering the tight end in the flat.  \nIn the shallow passing game with outlets and check-downs, Ewers displays awareness of the defender and places the ball in a favorable spot \nfor the receiver to work downhill.  \nEwers will hold safeties with his eyes during his drops before setting and firing away from the safety. He must show this ability in the middle \nof the field against linebackers.  \nEwers finds appropriate second reads after avoiding multiple points of pressure.  \nEwers will throw the ball away when pressure is unblocked, closing fast in the pocket, and his options during his initial two reads are \ncovered. He displays wise red-zone management when forced out of the pocket.  \nHis black-zone wisdom is not there. He tries for that extra read when he’s already avoided one point of pressure in his own-end zone and \nhis routes to that side of the field have been exhausted. It’s time to throw the ball away.  \nEwers has lapses when working through progressions. When edge pressure is forming, he misses the flat linebacker in position to cut off the \ntarget that he’s waiting to cross into an opening of the zone in the middle of the field.  \nEwers’ issues are either common problems for NFL starters or areas where rookies lack mature game management. His pocket management \nhas good techniques, but his conceptual feel could pose limitations on his potential.  \nEwers has an effective pocket clock, but he must speed it up when a limited number of receivers are working to a heavily zoned side of the \nfield. He’s vulnerable to blindside pressure.  \nHe can stay in a tight pocket to make initial reads, but he can accelerate that clock accurately based on the compression of the area. He \nidentifies unblocked edge pressure from the blind side post-snap. Ewers must improve his pre-snap identification of blindside corner blitzes.  \nEwers can flush, roll, and execute running and hitch-based climbs from pockets that compress and deliver with pinpoint accuracy in the \nshort and vertical ranges of the field. He can be patient in a tight pocket. He can economically sidestep backside edge pressure and deliver \nan accurate intermediate target 25 yards in the middle of the field, layering it over the shallow linebacker.  \nEwers displays conceptual and technical control with his footwork and handling pressure off a variety of drops. He can preemptively avoid \npressure with quick and early climbs. This buys him time to slow his pace and deliver a touch pass downfield.  \nIt’s possible NFL teams like Ewers’ brand-name game enough to believe in him as a potential starter they can use immediately as a reserve \nand give him a shot if the season is lost. Think Desmond Ridder.  \n\n \n86 \nI like Ewers more than Ridder because he sees leverage better. I can see a world where Ewers has a better NFL career if he finds a landing \nspot with excellent surrounding talent that helps him level up his game faster than most.  \nI may see that possibility, but I’m not buying it. I land in the camp of Ewers as a journeyman starter, at best, who is better as a playable \nbackup.  \n \nDrops: Ewers has a quick and precise three-step and five-step drops that end with an efficient set up where his feet are at shoulder width. \nHe can embed play fakes into precise three- and five-step drops. Ewers has an efficient seven-step drop on a designed roll from center.  \nBall Security: Ewers holds the ball with both hands in the pocket or keeps the ball at his chest with one hand. When breaking the pocket, \nEwers carries the ball near his chest but still lower and looser than he should.  \nPlay Fakes: Ewers is competent with his timing and extension of the ball on read fakes. He often sells the fake with his shoulders and lower \nbody and can set up in the tight pocket with one step. He can do this more often.  \nHe has good variety with his play fakes. He has the read fake, and he can make fakes with quick turns and extension with one arm to the \nball-carrier at his back hip before finishing the quick drop facing the defense.  \nThe detail with his play fakes on reverses and fly sweeps is also strong.  \nPump Fakes: Ewers has an effective shoulder fake at the top of a drop. He delivers an abbreviated play fake with limited violence to \nmanipulate the flat defender as he breaks the pocket. He also flashes the ball this way to manipulate an underneath defender. Ewers \ndoesn’t use it much, but he has a full motion pump fake with moderate violence.  \nRelease: Ewers sets up with the midline of his back foot and front toe aligned with his target. His drawback of the throwing arm is efficient \nand lacks any egregious tip below his chest. The drawback ends about half of a football’s length behind his shoulder and at helmet level. He \nbreaks the ball over his shoulder with effective speed. He earns effective rotation with his hips. \nEwers uses a side-arm release to deliver off-platform on screens to work around the pass rush. He climbs preemptively off designed half-\nrolls with his drops when he spots edge pressure during the drop.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Ewers is competent-to-good in the short and intermediate ranges of the field. His vertical accuracy has \nmore catchable accuracy than pinpoint accuracy and his deep accuracy is mostly inaccurate.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Unless pressured, Ewers isn’t throwing off-platform. Based on his off-platform work under pressure, he \nhas potential for shallow, intermediate, and vertical accuracy.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: His range with throws to the opposite boundary is 35-40 yards pinpoint and 40-45 yards catchable \naccuracy.  \nMobile Accuracy: Ewers spots the wide-open receiver in the middle of the field when rolling right. He can deliver 35 yards from \nthe release point with pinpoint accuracy and place it just well enough to give the receiver a small advantage against the peripheral \ncoverage peeling off its primary option to defend the throw.  \nHe’s accurate to his left at 15 yards to the boundary against man-to-man coverage.  \nDecision-Making: Ewers holds the C3 high safety during his drop and turns to the primary receiver at the top of the drop. He \nmakes a quick decision based on the route design and the defender’s leverage at the top of the stem.  \nEwers can improve his placement with the fade against C3, placing the ball closer to the boundary so the receiver at the numbers \ncan work away from the C3 safety instead of being led where the safety has an enhanced opportunity to defend the target.  \nEwers displays some awareness with his placement against peripheral coverage but the placement has room for improvement so \nthere’s complete protection from the defender rather than partial protection. He’s much better at accounting for the middle of the \nfield defender in the shallow zones.  \nThis accounting for defenders isn’t as accurate when Ewers his checking down after two reads downfield and the timeline to see the \nperipheral defender is shorter. When it’s one read, he can see flat defenders peeling downfield and opt to throw a deeper target out \nof bounds because of the legitimate threat for the flat or shallow boundary defender to undercut the target.  \nEwers has lapses where he’s not patient enough to see if the C2 cornerback continues trailing the outside receiver or if he peels off \nthat receiver and helps with covering the tight end in the flat.  \n\n \n87 \nIn the shallow passing game with outlets and check-downs, Ewers displays awareness of the defender and places the ball in a \nfavorable spot for the receiver to work downhill.  \nEwers will hold safeties with his eyes during his drops before setting and firing away from the safety. He must show this ability in \nthe middle of the field against linebackers.  \nSense Pressure: Ewers has an effective pocket clock. He can stay in a tight pocket to make initial reads but can accelerate that clock \naccurately based on the compression of the area.  \nHe identifies unblocked edge pressure from the blind side post-snap. Ewers must improve his pre-snap identification of blindside corner \nblitzes. He must also speed up his pocket clock when a limited number of receivers are working to a heavily zoned side of the field so he’s \nnot vulnerable to blindside pressure.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Ewers can flush, roll, and execute running and hitch-based climbs from pockets that compress and deliver \nwith pinpoint accuracy in the short and vertical ranges of the field. He can be patient in a tight pocket. He can economically sidestep \nbackside edge pressure and deliver an accurate intermediate target 25 yards in the middle of the field, layering it over the shallow \nlinebacker.  \nEwers displays conceptual and technical control with his footwork and handling pressure off a variety of drops. He can preemptively avoid \npressure with quick and early climbs. This buys him time to slow his pace and deliver a touch pass downfield.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Ewers can layer his throw over box defenders off quick and embedded play-action during a three-step \ndrop and do so with touch and accuracy as an interior pressure barrels down the chute.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Ewers can deliver around edge rushers when throwing jump-pass on a quick RPO/screen to the flat. He \ncan be inventive with throwing platforms with pressure tight to him in the pocket.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Ewers has potential for pinpoint shallow accuracy and catchable intermediate accuracy.  \nMobile Accuracy: Ewers can make running climbs and throw 30-35 yards down field with layered accuracy and accounting for \nperipheral coverage with his placement. He can also make controlled climbs and add a flush against a third defender, delivering \naccurately to a backside receiver in the intermediate game.  \nEwers can climb and sidestep two points of pressure and deliver a catchable pass 25 yards from the pitch to the middle of the field \nwith a sidearm release.  \nMoving right, he has a range of 40-45 yards of pinpoint accuracy.  \nDecision-Making: Ewers finds appropriate second reads after avoiding multiple points of pressure.  \nEwers will throw the ball away when pressure is unblocked, closing fast in the pocket, and his options during his initial two reads \nare covered. He displays wise red-zone management when forced out of the pocket.  \nHis black-zone wisdom is not there. He tries for that extra read when he’s already avoided one point of pressure in his own-end \nzone and his routes to that side of the field have been exhausted. It’s time to throw the ball away.  \nEwers has lapses when working through progressions, edge pressure is forming, and he misses the flat linebacker in position to cut \noff the target he’s waiting for to cross into an opening of the zone in the middle of the field \nScrambling: Ewers can avoid multiple points of pressure with a flush towards the right and keep his eyes downfield. He’ll pull through \nreaches to his upper body in the pocket.  \nRunning: Ewers can make the first man miss in the flat when he breaks the pocket. He uses the combination of his feet and a quick play \nfake. He’s quick enough to earn chain-moving gains. He slides when it’s time to end a run with pursuit arriving over the top. He’ll dive head-\nfirst to get under oncoming defenders.  \nDurability: Ewers injured his shoulder in 2022, his non-throwing shoulder in 2023, his oblique in 2024, and abdominal strain in 2024, and \nan ankle injury in 2024.  \nThe oblique injury cost him two games.

        "analysis": "Quinn Ewers is a quarterback prospect with a high ceiling but also significant concerns regarding his consistency and decision-making.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Arm Talent:** Possesses a strong arm with accuracy excelling in short to intermediate ranges and decent vertical accuracy up to 42 yards.  His deep throws, however, are inconsistent.\n* **Mechanics:** Shows good fundamentals in drops, ball fakes, and release mechanics.  His setup is efficient, and his release is quick and smooth.\n* **Pocket Presence (with caveats):**  Displays an effective pocket clock and can maneuver effectively within a tight pocket. He’s adept at identifying and avoiding pressure, particularly from the blind side *post-snap*.  He shows ability to make throws on the run.\n* **Play Action:**  Competent in executing play-action fakes, selling them effectively to manipulate defenders.\n* **Short and Intermediate Accuracy:** Consistently accurate on short and intermediate throws, both on and off platform, even under pressure.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Deep Accuracy:** Needs significant improvement in deep accuracy and ball placement. While he can hit throws in the 28-42 yard range, consistently connecting on throws beyond that is crucial for NFL success.\n* **Decision-Making:** Prone to lapses in judgment, especially when reading coverages and working through progressions under pressure. He occasionally forces throws and fails to recognize open check-downs or throw the ball away in crucial situations.  His pre-snap read of blindside blitzes needs work.\n* **Peripheral Awareness:** While he shows some awareness of peripheral defenders, his placement needs improvement to consistently protect his receivers.\n* **Pocket Clock Management (Pre-Snap):** While he has a good pocket clock, he needs to accelerate it when facing heavily zoned areas with limited receivers to avoid blindside pressure.\n* **Durability:**  A history of injuries (shoulder, oblique, abdominal, ankle) raises concerns about his long-term health.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares Ewers to Brock Purdy and C.J. Beathard.  This suggests a potential range of outcomes:  Purdy, a late-round pick who exceeded expectations, versus Beathard, a journeyman backup. The report leans more towards Ewers having a journeyman starter ceiling, at best.  The Desmond Ridder comparison is also given; however the report suggests Ewers' leverage reading skills are better than Ridder's.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nEwers has the physical tools and some refined skills to potentially succeed in the NFL. However, his inconsistency in decision-making, deep accuracy, and durability concerns suggest a high degree of risk. His success hinges on improving his decision-making, deep ball accuracy, and staying healthy.  He projects as a late-round draft pick with a potential to be a backup who may start if given the opportunity and proper surrounding talent.\n"

Brosmer’s accuracy is pinpoint in the shallow range of \nthe field, competent in the intermediate and vertical zones. Ask Brosmer to target receivers inside 40 yards of his release point, and he can \nget the job done as a pinpoint passer.  \n \nHis best work comes as a timing passer from the pocket where he can buy time with ball fakes. Brosmer will roll from pressure. He’ll also \nexecute small climbs in the pocket from edge pressure. When pressure pushes a running back into his lap, Brosmer will hang in there unless \nthere’s additional interior pressure arriving unblocked. In this case, Brosmer will spin and roll, but he’s not quick enough to get away with \nthe roll.  \nBrosmer can reduce his shoulder, duck, and climb from pressure. He does a good job anticipating edge pressure and sliding two steps inside \nto create space for a target. He can make small evasive maneuvers with slides and climbs, and he can also climb in rhythm with 2-3 hitches \nand deliver the ball downfield.  \nBrosmer will take a hit from a blitzing linebacker up the middle to get off an accurate vertical shot. He must integrate his pre-snap \nidentification of edge pressure off the blindside into his decision-making and take what’s available. Brosmer can also be reactive to flashes \nof potential pressure that doesn’t arrive.  \nBrosmer has some skills as a decision-maker. He can work sideline-to-sideline with timely reads off play-action and correctly determine the \ncheck-down is the best decision. Brosmer can hold defenders to one side of the field to set up a quick pivot and throw to the middle of the \nfield from a route breaking from the backside.  \nHe can deliver layered throws over linebackers up the seam with pinpoint accuracy to vertical routes. When he doesn’t recognize favorable \nleverage in front of him, Brosmer will opt to throw the ball away when he had a completion.  \nBrosmer must account for the peripheral defender when targeting receivers across the field. He’s better at it when the peripheral defender \nis playing high or low of the intended target. He can account for peripheral defenders on multiple quick reads on each play and adjust his \nposition subtly from pressure to give time to resolve one of those peripheral defender angles to generate a completion.  \nBrosmer and his receivers must be on the same page with routes over the middle. When should the receiver settle or continue his route. \nBrosmer has thrown interceptions because he expected one thing and the receiver did another.  \nHe’ll take a sack when the passing lane to his check-down is blocked by an end and forcing the throw is risky. He’s good at targeting the \nball away from the leverage of the defenders covering the receiver. Even if he’s not pinpoint accurate under pressure with some of these \nthrows, the ball is only where the receiver can make the play—especially in the red zone.  \nAlthough the lapses are few, Brosmer has gotten greedy where he passes up an easy shallow read with space for the receiver to run, and he \nwinds up taking a sack because the secondary reads weren’t open. This is important because in those situations there was clear pre-snap \nsigns of pressure from the blindside, so it’s best to presume if the first read is open, that’s all the time the QB will have.  \nLike most QBs, his accuracy wanes under pressure. Still, Brosmer makes enough layered throws downfield under pressure that it’s \npremature to write him off as a player who fizzles with defenders in his face.  \nI don’t see Brosmer transcending a backup role, but I like the potential he could have long-term in this capacity and without the lows that \nsome of the higher-profile options on the board might have with their games.  \nDrops: Brosmer has an efficient one- and two-step drop plan and setup from Pistol and shotgun. He also has three- and five-step drops \nthat are well-paced, but end with a setup with a wide stance that can make subsequent movements inefficient – as a thrower and \nmaneuvering the pocket. This stance issues are lapses more than the norm.  \nAs a norm, Brosmer can deliver all drop depths with a variety of step rates and widths to accommodate his alignment and the play-action \nused on the play.  \nBrosmer’s seven-step drop from center is quick, smooth, and ends with an efficient setup where his feet are shoulder width.  \nHis footwork is good enough to execute a variety of play fakes, boots, rolls, sprints, throwbacks, and screens with drops from center, Pistol, \nor shotgun.  \n\n \n91 \nBall Security: Brosmer carries the ball under his right arm by default. He can tuck it close to his chest. He must do so earlier in a run and \nmore often.  \nPlay Fakes: Brosmer extends the ball toward the back and turns his back on the defense when executing a seven-step drop from center \nwith this action. He does this well with five-step drops from center. He delivers one- and two-handed fakes. He can sell the exchange more \nwith his body.  \nPump Fakes: Brosmer has a full-motion pump fake with moderate velocity to freeze coverage and/or pressure. He can give a flash of the \nball to finish manipulating one side of the field. Brosmer also uses a shoulder fake during his drop to hold the defense as he opens his frame \nto that side before pivoting to his intended target at the end of the drop.  \nRelease: Brosmer has lapses where he sets with a wide stance that’s wider than shoulder width. The midline of his back foot is aligned with \nthe target. The front toe rotates through the release until it’s aligned with the target’s path.  \nThe upper-body component of Brosmer’s release is compact. The draw back is efficient and the release is over the shoulder. He gets \nrotation through his hips to generate power.  \nHe can deliver the ball on the move rolling to his right with a three-quarter release. He can roll left with pressure in his face and sidearm the \nrelease with accuracy at 12-15 yards.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Brosmer can drop the ball between the corner and safety in Cover 2. He has pinpoint accuracy to the \nnear boundary covering 35 yards from the release point to the catch point.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: He has strong short-range accuracy.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Brosmer has pinpoint accuracy at 42 yards to the opposite boundary.  \nMobile Accuracy: Brosmer is often pinpoint in the shallow range of the field. \nDecision-Making: Brosmer can work sideline-to-sideline with timely reads off play-action and correctly determine the check-down \nis the best decision. Brosmer can hold defenders to one side of the field to set up a quick pivot and throw to the middle of the field \nfrom a route breaking from the backside.  \nHe can deliver layered throws over linebackers up the seam with pinpoint accuracy to vertical routes. Brosmer also doesn’t \nrecognize favorable leverage in front of him and will opt to throw the ball away when he had a completion.  \nBrosmer must account for the peripheral defender when targeting receivers across the field. He’s better at it when the peripheral \ndefender is playing high or low of the intended target. He can account for peripheral defenders on multiple quick reads on each \nplay and adjust his position subtly from pressure to give time to resolve one of those peripheral defender angles to generate a \ncompletion.  \nSense Pressure: Brosmer identifies post-snap pressure from the edge and up the middle. He can react to pressure that isn’t there and bolt \nthe pocket to one side when he had an open man he could have targeted with a simple sidestep into the open passing lane.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Brosmer will roll from pressure. He’ll also execute small climbs in the pocket from edge pressure. When \npressure pushes a running back into his lap, Brosmer will hang in there unless there’s additional interior pressure arriving unblocked. In this \ncase, Brosmer will spin and roll, but he’s not quick enough to get away with the roll.  \nBrosmer can reduce his shoulder, duck, and climb from pressure. He does a good job anticipating edge pressure and sliding two steps inside \nto create space for a target. He can make small evasive maneuvers with slides and climbs, and he can also climb in rhythm with 2-3 hitches \nand deliver the ball downfield.  \nBrosmer will take a hit from a blitzing linebacker up the middle to get off an accurate vertical shot. He must integrate his pre-snap \nidentification of edge pressure off the blindside into his decision-making and take what’s available.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Brosmer can take a short step backward from pressure and throw off the back foot with pinpoint \naccuracy within 10 yards of the release. He can take hits to deliver pinpoint throws to the near sideline of 30-35 yards against tight \ncoverage.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Brosmer can deliver off his back foot with pinpoint accuracy 14 yards from the release while backing \naway from pressure in his face.  \n\n \n92 \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: He has a range of 49 yards to the opposite flat for at least general/catchable accuracy after climbing \nthe pocket from pressure.  \nMobile Accuracy: Brosmer can deliver 30 yards from the release point on the move to his right with catchable and pinpoint \naccuracy. \nDecision-Making: Brosmer and his receivers must be on the same page with routes over the middle. When should the receiver \nsettle or continue his route. Brosmer has thrown interceptions because he expected one thing and the receiver did another.  \nBrosmer will take a sack when the passing lane to his check-down is blocked by an end and forcing the throw is risky. He’s good at \ntargeting the ball away from the leverage of the defenders covering the receiver. Even if he’s not pinpoint accurate under pressure \nwith some of these throws, the ball is only where the receiver can make the play—especially in the red zone.  \nAlthough the lapses are few, Brosmer has gotten greedy on 1st and 10 between the 20s where he passes up an easy shallow read \nwith space for the receiver to run and winds up taking a sack because the secondary reads weren’t open. This is important because \nin those situations there was clear pre-snap signs of pressure from the blindside, so it’s best to presume if the first read is open, \nthat’s all the time the QB will have.  \nLike most QBs, his accuracy wanes under pressure. Still, Brosmer makes enough layered throws downfield under pressure that it’s \npremature to write him off as a player who fizzles with defenders in his face.  \nScrambling: Brosmer typically beats one point of pressure. He’s not the type of athlete or refined mover to beat two or more points of \npressure unless it’s in a succession with that has some time between the two penetrating blitzers.  \nRunning: Brosmer can get outside the pocket and earn chain-moving gains. He will slide and if he can’t do this one time, he’ll dive under \nhits.  \nDurability: Torn ACL and torn LCL during career – LCL in high school. He tore his ACL and meniscus in 2021 in camp.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Brosmer from afar. \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHolding defense to one side, placement with backside dig \n• \nNot maximizing leaks and check-downs with placement \n• \nLayered throw up the seam \n• \nPocket reactivity  \n• \nMisses favorable leverage read over the middle or doesn’t believe it and throws ball away \n• \nPump to outlet, climbs, and targets cross but had deep fade one-on-one \n• \nAnticipates pressure with a slide and checks down \n• \nHolds safety and returns to near-side boundary for 35-yard throw one-on-one \n• \nFive-step drop with play action, tight-coverage placement with interior pressure \n• \nPinpoint 33-yard fade to right boundary vs. interior pressure \n• \nOpposite sideline vertical shot and discussion of arm talent \n• \nQuick and underrated processing, field vision, and pocket feel \n• \nIntegrating pre-snap blitz ID with initial post-snap read: improvement needed \n• \nRecurring theme: good processing but execution is catchable but not pinpoint \n• \nCorollary to recurring them: Layered throws in tight zone windows vs pressure \n• \nLayered throw of 30+ yards vs two unblocked defenders up the middle  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n93",
        "analysis": "Max Brosmer: QB Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy (Short to Intermediate Range):**  Exhibits pinpoint accuracy on short and intermediate throws, particularly from a stationary platform.  His accuracy shines in timing-based passing situations from the pocket.\n* **Pocket Presence/Maneuverability:** Demonstrates good pocket awareness, utilizing small slides and climbs to evade pressure and create throwing lanes.  He’s willing to take hits to deliver the ball.\n* **Processing/Decision-Making:** Shows promising decision-making skills, particularly in reading play-action and identifying check-down options.  He’s capable of working through multiple reads and accounting for peripheral defenders.\n* **Mechanics:** Possesses efficient dropbacks and a compact, over-the-shoulder throwing motion.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Deep Accuracy/Pressure Performance:** While his short-to-intermediate accuracy is strong, his deep accuracy and performance under pressure need improvement.  His accuracy suffers under pressure, though he still makes some impressive throws.\n* **Decision-Making Consistency:** Although his decision-making is often sound, he occasionally makes poor choices, like passing up easy short throws and forcing risky ones leading to sacks or interceptions.  He needs to improve integrating pre-snap pressure identification into his post-snap reads.\n* **Route Timing with Receivers:**  Needs better synchronicity with receivers, particularly on routes over the middle, to avoid interceptions due to timing mismatches.\n* **Mobility:** While able to extend plays and make some scrambles, he's not a highly mobile quarterback.  He's best beating one pressure point.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Nathan Peterman\n\nThe comparison to Nathan Peterman highlights Brosmer's potential as a low-mistake backup quarterback with some starter traits in limited situations.  Peterman, known for his accuracy but inconsistency, serves as a cautionary tale that Brosmer needs to avoid becoming solely a player who is only successful against limited defenses.  Brosmer's ceiling might not be as high as some higher-ranked prospects, but his floor is potentially higher as a consistently accurate, low-risk backup.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBrosmer projects as a late-round draft pick or undrafted free agent with the potential to develop into a reliable backup quarterback in the NFL.  His strong short-to-intermediate accuracy and pocket presence are key assets. However, he needs to improve his deep accuracy, consistency under pressure, and overall decision-making to reach his full potential.  His injury history is also a significant factor to consider.\n"

Unlike Ewers, McCord has flaws that could also force him from the league.  \n \nLet’s get that out of the way first, because if McCord can’t overcome his tendencies to double-down on bad reads, any future as an NFL \nstarter will evaporate. Watch McCord try to fit the ball into favorable defensive leverage that’s squatting over the receiver and reading \nMcCord’s eyes, and one can imagine McCord yelling to Will Levis and Desmond Ridder to hold his beer.  \n \nThere are lots of prospects with arm talent, chain-moving mobility, and fundamentally sound drops who can avoid making the same mistake \ntwice, much less three or four times. McCord has the kind of belief Jameis Winston once had about being able to make the ball disappear \ninto the defender’s chest and rematerialize behind them into the receivers’ hands.  \n \nIf Magical-Surrealist author Gabriel Garcia-Marquez grew up in L.A., Arizona, or Texas, he might have written about a quarterback who had \nthis ability. He probably would have loved Winston as a character.  \n \nMcCord also leads players into unnecessary contact. When it comes down to the win/lose of McCord’s game, it’s about learning to read and \nrespect the leverage of defenders on receivers. Either he doesn’t know how to do it, can’t see it, or he willfully ignores it.   \n \nHighlighting the rest of his game that you can read below isn’t worth doing until McCord proves he can change his ways.  \n \nTechnical: McCord’s pass placement is prone to being in range of trail coverage cutting it off or making the target more difficult than it \nshould. McCord must improve his placement so he’s leading receivers away from the defender.  \nConceptual: McCord is slow to learn from conceptual/game management mistakes. He repeats mistakes that should be addressable within \nthe game. His red-zone decision-making is reckless and unnecessary. See the forced red-zone targets on slants shown in the film examples \nat the end of this report.  \nDrops: McCord’s quick-passing offense gives him a lot of one-step drops and setups. He has a well-paced and precise three-step drop. He \nalso has five-step and seven-step drops.  \nHe can truncate and adjust 3- and 5-step drops to pressure so he can set up in space to deliver targets.  \nBall Security: McCord holds the ball low and away from his frame when he’s breaking the pocket and in the open field. As defenders close \nhe doesn’t tuck it unless he’s in the middle of the field and even then he’s late to do so. The elbow is still loose but the ball is close to the \nchest.  \nPlay Fakes: McCord uses the two-handed extension into the frame on read plays. He uses a one-handed jab with his back to the defense \nmid-way through a seven-step drop from center. He can use his upper body to sell the exchange better and for longer.  \nPump Fakes: McCord has a small shoulder fake mid-drop to set up a double move for his outside receiver. McCord also delivers a partial \npump fake that’s about one-half to two-thirds of the full range of motion and with mild intensity.  \nRelease: McCord has a compact throwing motion. He releases the ball over his shoulder. His front leg locks out at the knee and the ball \nsails on shallow targets.  \nThe pace of McCord’s motion is like a slingshot—slow to load and sudden at the release. He brings the ball behind him slowly and the \nrelease is fast. He can deliver with a three-quarter motion around a blitzing defender.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: When there’s no pressure, McCord sticks a lot of throws with ideal placement against tight man coverage \nin the short and intermediate ranges of the field. Even so, he has lapses without pressure where the placement is catchable for \nboth the receiver and the defender and it could have been avoided.  \nThis becomes a problem for McCord when there’s tight coverage or the lack of pinpoint accuracy forces a receiver to adjust into \ndownhill pursuit rather than adjust away from it. The Pitt game is a great example. McCord had five bad throws out of six attempts \nand by halfway through the first quarter, Pitt was up 10-0 and had two interceptions.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: McCord is pinpoint accurate in the short and intermediate range. \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: McCord has the arm to easily deliver a 38-yard opposite-hash fade to the far-side numbers with near-\npinpoint accuracy.  \nMobile Accuracy: McCord is accurate in the short and intermediate range if you consider his mobile accuracy under pressure, \nwhich is simply more difficult situations but in the same range of the field and style of movement.  \n\n \n95 \nDecision-Making: McCord must show more awareness of defenders on the periphery of his intended target. He leads receivers \ninto unnecessary contact. He also targets receivers who are not open because of that peripheral coverage that can slide outside or \ninside without effort to cut off the pass. I saw two passes in four games where he accounted for a middle of the field defender and \nplaced the ball to protect his receiver. This was the Boston College game, so sequentially speaking, McCord is making progress in \nthis area.  \nMcCord can quickly move off his first read and fire to his second read in the shallow range.  \nOn sprint passes, McCord will throw the ball away when he doesn’t find open receivers to the play side and pressure forces him to \nretreat late in the sprint.  \nWhen McCord isn’t forcing targets in the red zone, he can work to his second read efficiently and place the ball where the receiver \nis the only one to make the catch.  \nMcCord can be overconfident targeting receivers at the boundary on fades where the corner has the receiver pinning to the \nboundary at the hip before the decision to throw. He must respect the leverage of the defender more.  \nSense Pressure: McCord senses edge pressure to the side of his throwing arm about 2-3 steps away. The same is true with interior \npressure. He identifies pre-snap edge pressure and adjusts to the potential of its arrival. \nManeuvering From Pressure: McCord will stand in the pocket and deliver with interior pressure coming downhill and hitting McCord as \nthe ball leaves his hand. When he senses edge pressure to his throwing arm’s side, he can retreat and roll to that right side. He’ll reset and \ndeliver a pinpoint vertical shot up the flat.  \nAgainst interior pressure, McCord will retreat, spin, and roll outside the pocket. He will adjust a two-step drop into a deeper retreat before \nexecuting the spin and roll. McCord can execute the spin and roll too early against blindside pressure and doesn’t change the defender’s \npursuit angle enough to avoid a sack. He begins the spin when the defender is 2-3 steps away and he’s not quick enough to work away \nfrom pressure that early with this move.  \nWhen he waits for press to get within a step, McCord’s spin and roll is effective.  \nMcCord can finish a two-step drop with interior pressure bearing down and reduce his shoulder with a quick sidestep to avoid the defender. \nHe can reset and fire a short boundary pass with accuracy against tight coverage.  \nMcCord can climb a pocket, but there are too many plays where he has an opportunity to climb and he chooses to spin and roll. The climb \nwas the more efficient play that kept the entire field open. The spin and rolls cut off the field and led to more pressure on McCord.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: McCord can deliver 20 yards downfield with pinpoint accuracy as pressure is bearing down on him. \nMcCord can target the back shoulder of a receiver slanting into a defender’s leverage on a quick-hitting play, although it was a bad \ndecision to make the attempt.  \nMcCord can place the ball back-shoulder up the boundary against man coverage at 38 yards from the pitch.  \nHe’s willing to squeeze the ball into tight intermediate zones and, to his credit, he gives the receiver a catchable ball. The problem \nis that if the target isn’t caught, it’s vulnerable to defenders in the area.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: McCord can deliver off his back foot 15 yards to the middle of the field but his passes are prone to \nsailing. He can deliver 26 yards off his back foot while rolling to his right hitting a receiver at the near-side boundary.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: McCord has good back-shoulder placement against man-to-man coverage 38 yards downfield against \ninterior pressure.  \nMobile Accuracy: McCord can deliver the ball 15 yards from the pitch point to his receiver on a sprint pass to the right with \npressure closing.  \nDecision-Making: McCord does not read leverage well when he’s considering a slant with a defender playing off and inside shade \nto cut off the target. The added factor of edge pressure to the play side influences McCord to force the target and he’ll do this in \nthe red zone where, at worst, taking the sack is a better alternative. To compound this issue, McCord didn’t learn from it the first \ntime. Later in the same game with the exact situation, he tried to force the target again.  \nWhen presented with two options in a similar area of the field and similar route depths, McCord eschews the route working back to \nhim with the defender at the receiver’s back. Instead, he attacks the route heading downfield into that same defender who can \ndeliver a dangerous hit to the receiver or cut off target easier. \n\n \n96 \nWhen interior pressure forces McCord to retreat, spin, and roll outside the pocket in the red zone, he takes a quick look at the \nreceivers in front of him and either targets them or throws the ball away.  \nHe has multiple passes deflected in games and of the contributing factors is him forcing targets on screens that aren’t well-\ndeveloped or they are well-covered.  \nScrambling: McCord can buy time versus one point of pressure and extend outside the pocket or break the pocket inside.  \nRunning: He has enough speed and quickness to roll outside interior pressure and sprint to the far sideline for a chain-moving gain. He’s \nnot sudden and he won’t make defenders miss with one-on-one situations. With multiple blocks downfield, McCord can weave through the \nopen field and generate a field-flipping gain as long as he doesn’t have to put a move on a defender to make them miss. He’ll slide to end a \nrun or sell out when it’s a pivotal moment in the game.  \nDurability: Played through an ankle injury in 2023.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: There’s a realistic world without magic where McCord refines his game and capitalizes on his strengths to \nbecome a viable contributor. I don’t believe we’re in that world.

        "analysis": "Kyle McCord is a quarterback prospect with a high ceiling but significant flaws that could prevent him from reaching his full potential.  His RSP ranking of QB10 reflects this duality.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Arm Talent and Accuracy (under ideal conditions):** McCord possesses a strong arm and demonstrates pinpoint accuracy on shorter and intermediate throws, particularly when on platform and without significant pressure.  He shows the ability to make accurate throws across the field (opposite hash).  His velocity is notable, described as a \"slingshot\" release.\n* **Mobility:** He possesses decent mobility, enabling him to extend plays and make throws outside the pocket, especially in short and intermediate ranges. He can effectively avoid pressure by rolling out or resetting.\n* **Pocket Presence (with limitations):** He shows the ability to stand in the pocket and deliver under pressure. He can sense pressure effectively and makes adjustments in response.\n* **Physical Tools:** His size (6'3\", 218 lbs) and arm strength are attractive NFL traits.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:** This is his biggest weakness. McCord struggles to consistently read defensive leverage, leading to forced throws into tight coverage, especially in the red zone. He frequently repeats these mistakes.  Improvement in this area is crucial for his NFL prospects.\n* **Game Management:**  He needs to improve his decision-making under pressure and show better judgment in choosing targets. His overconfidence in forcing throws leads to turnovers and missed opportunities.\n* **Refining Mechanics:** While his arm talent is strong, refining his footwork and throwing mechanics could lead to greater consistency and accuracy.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided is Drew Lock – X – Christian Hackenberg. This highlights the range of possible outcomes.  Drew Lock represents a high-upside, but ultimately inconsistent, player who struggles with accuracy and decision-making. Christian Hackenberg represents a player with significant potential who never reached it and ultimately failed in the NFL.  The \"X\" suggests McCord could fall anywhere between these two extremes.  His potential is high, but his flaws could derail his career.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nMcCord is a high-risk, high-reward prospect.  His physical gifts are undeniable, but his decision-making and tendency to force throws are significant concerns.  His NFL success hinges on dramatically improving his ability to read defenses and make smarter decisions.  He has the potential to be a starter, but just as easily could end up as a backup or out of the league entirely.\n"

His downfield \nplacement vacillates between awareness of the defender and placing his receiver at a disadvantage.  \n \nHenigan is a capable pocket manager and scrambler. If he can improve his placement downfield and realize the fullest extent of his \naccuracy, Henigan could surprise as long-term project.  \n \nDrops: Henigan has efficient three-step and five-step drops in terms of spacing and pacing of footwork. He finishes with a balanced stance. \nHe can adjust his drop speed to pressure. He also has a seven-step drop that the offense rarely employs.  \nBall Security: Henigan tucks the ball high to his chest when encountering traffic. When breaking the pocket to his right, he carries the ball \nunder his right arm. When breaking to the left, he uses both hands for too long as if he’s carrying it like an option pitch man before tucking \nto his right arm despite the pursuit coming from the right. \nHe holds the ball with both hands in the pocket and can take contact to the ball from a pass rusher. I’ve seen him carry the ball under his \nleft arm once in five charted games. It’s unusual.  \nPlay Fakes: Henigan has good timing with read plays and holds the ball long enough to sell the potential exchange.  \nPump Fakes: Henigan can bring the ball back after beginning a throw, resulting in a partial-motion pump fake with minimal violence. He \nhas an effective shoulder fake at the top of drops after opening to one side. He also has a three-quarter motion pump fake with moderate \nviolence when breaking the pocket to freeze a flat defender.  \nRelease: Henigan has a compact release motion with his upper body and throws the ball over his shoulder and with three-quarter and \nsidearm variations. His drawback is efficient and the ball never dips below his chest. The ball is just behind his shoulder at the furthest point \nfrom his body.  \nThe midline of his back foot and front toe are aligned with the target. He generates hip rotation to generate power and the ball comes out \nsmooth and fast.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Henigan can deliver 46 yards from the pitch to the near-side boundary with pinpoint accuracy on the \nfade. He misses intermediate targets because he’s throwing slightly behind receivers with tight trail coverage in position to knock \nthe ball away. Henigan also has lapses where he leads receivers into coverage where Henigan can’t protect the receiver from the \noncoming hits.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: There’s potential for a pinpoint short game.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: He’s pinpoint in the shallow ranges and has potential for pinpoint accuracy in the vertical and deep \nranges.  \nMobile Accuracy: Henigan is accurate in the shallow and intermediate ranges.  \nDecision-Making: Henigan can work from one side of the field to the other and consider two routes before going to a third and \nthat third isn’t always a check-down. He’s effective and holding the Cover 1 safety to one side of the field before coming back to \nthe opposite side of the field to select one of two man-to-man options.  \nWhen making quick throws up the intermediate seam, Henigan places the ball to the back shoulder to protect the receiver from the \nsafety over the top. He can also layer the ball over the shallow linebacker.  \nWhen Henigan errs with placement with aggressive decisions, he targets the leverage that’s in favor of the defender and not the \nreceiver.  \nSense Pressure: Henigan will stand and deliver against oncoming edge pressure.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Henigan will make a late climb from blindside edge pressure, reducing his shoulder just as the edge \ndefender reaches for his torso. He can pull through the reach of the defender.  \nHenigan sidesteps edge pressure early so he can access a passing lane away from that pressure. He’ll also climb and flush from edge \npressure to the open flat. \nHenigan has good timing with his spin-and-roll to the right or the left.  \n \n\n \n99 \nAccuracy (Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Henigan will try to fit the ball into tight zones that can prove difficult for his prowess with pass \nplacement, especially when trying to throw the ball over an edge defender’s rush. He has a range of 53-55 yards to the near side \nflat with catchable accuracy while taking a hit during the release.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: His short-range accuracy is pinpoint. His intermediate-range accuracy has potential to be catchable.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Pinpoint at 46 yards from the pitch. His accuracy in the vertical game to the opposite field is \ncompelling.  \nMobile Accuracy: He must display more velocity and placement to properly lead a receiver when rolling to his right. When \ntargeting a receiver 37 yards on the move to his right, his accuracy is catchable but gives coverage an opportunity to make a play \non the ball.  \nHe can sidestep in opposite directions in succession to avoid two points of pressure, reduce his pads and climb to deliver an \naccurate intermediate target. He can climb and deliver an opposite-boundary deep shot with pinpoint placement at 46 yards.  \nDecision-Making: Henigan monitors the drop of safeties and the shifts of the middle linebacker in relation to routes he targets \nworking across the middle of the field.  \nHenigan will throw the ball away when early pressure reaches the pocket and he’s backed up in the black zone. He can have lapses \nwhere he throws the ball away when there’s a wide-open target at the boundary where he’s throwing the ball away. He may not \nsee it with the edge pressure unblocked and in his passing lane.  \nScrambling: Henigan can avoid one point of pressure. He can sidestep in opposite directions in succession to avoid two points of pressure, \nreduce his pads and climb to deliver an accurate intermediate target.  \nRunning: Henigan can pull through reaches to his upper body. He is quick enough to move the chains on designed runs to the short-side \nedge. He dives under defenders to finish runs in in traffic. He can slide feet-first, but he must decide sooner.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Henigan from afar unless in a deep SuperFlex format with rosters of at least 40 players and \npractice squad.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nWorks to across the field to his third read against C1 \n• \nAccurate deep shot near-boundary and efficient release \n• \nLayered seam shot protecting receiver off one-step drop \n• \nFeels edge pressure, climb+flush, IDs option vertical shot, but inaccurate \n• \nUnnecessary throwaway \n• \nSidesteps in succession against two points of pressure, poise, catchable accuracy \n• \nSidestep, climb, and second read \n• \nINT: Trying to fit an intermediate target into a tight zone window and over a rusher \n• \nClimb and 46-yard opposite sideline with placement \n• \nGame-winner: 38 yards opposite sideline with 0:37 left \n• \nAggressive versus tight coverage and has lapses with placement favoring DB’s leverage \n• \n35 yards pinpoint vs interior pressure off back foot to the opposite flat \n• \nManipulates MOF defender \n• \n53 yards catchable accuracy while taking a hit \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n100",
        "analysis": "## Seth Henigan: Player Profile Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Aggressive Mindset & Sound Mechanics:** Henigan displays a confident, aggressive playing style coupled with fundamentally sound throwing mechanics.  His release is compact and efficient, generating good velocity.\n* **Accuracy (with caveats):**  He shows promising accuracy across all ranges on platform throws, particularly in the short and intermediate areas. His pinpoint accuracy on short and intermediate throws, especially to the opposite hash, is a notable strength.  He can also deliver accurate deep shots.\n* **Pocket Management & Scrambling Ability:** Henigan is a capable pocket manager, demonstrating the ability to adjust his drop depth to pressure. He's also a proficient scrambler, effectively avoiding pressure and extending plays.  He can sidestep multiple rushers and deliver accurate throws on the move.\n* **Decision-Making (with caveats):** He shows good pre-snap reads, working through progressions and effectively manipulating defenders. He can layer throws to avoid coverage.\n* **Play-action & Pump Fakes:**  Effective in selling play-action and utilizing various pump fakes to manipulate defenses.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Downfield Accuracy & Placement:** While possessing the arm strength for deep throws, Henigan’s downfield accuracy and placement are inconsistent. He sometimes throws into tight windows where the defender has leverage, leading to interceptions or incompletions.  Improving his ball placement downfield is crucial.\n* **Decision-Making Under Pressure:** While generally good at handling pressure, he occasionally makes poor decisions, throwing the ball away when open receivers are available or forcing throws into tight coverage.\n* **Ball Security (minor concern):** While generally good, his ball carrying technique when scrambling needs refinement for consistency.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum provided (Drew Lock/Sam Howell - X - Zach Wilson - Devin Leary) highlights the range of potential outcomes.  He shares some traits with each:\n\n* **Drew Lock/Sam Howell:**  Possesses the arm talent and aggressiveness but needs to improve consistency and decision-making, as those two players did at the start of their careers.\n* **Zach Wilson:** Similar in terms of athleticism and arm strength, but lacks the same polish and consistency that Wilson showed (at least initially).\n* **Devin Leary:**  Similar in terms of accuracy in shorter ranges but needs to work on developing downfield accuracy and avoiding interceptions.\n\nThe \"X\" suggests that Henigan’s profile doesn't perfectly align with any of these comparisons, highlighting his unique blend of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nHenigan is a developmental prospect with intriguing potential. His arm talent, mechanics, and scrambling ability are assets.  However, his inconsistent downfield accuracy and occasional lapses in decision-making under pressure need significant improvement to succeed at the NFL level. He projects as a late-round draft pick or priority free agent who may need time to develop on a practice squad before contributing meaningfully.\n"

He’s a good \nexecutor with zone reads.  \n \nGabriel could benefit from tightening his release mechanics. Gabriel can take too long to come off his first read when there are two \ndefenders with excellent leverage to stop a quick slant. He’ll stare down the first read until there’s a defender in his face, if not sacking him.  \nGabriel can work from his first read at the boundary, recognize the safety has good coverage, turn to his second read over the middle, and \nplace the ball in stride to the receiver on the intermediate dig route. \nGabriel will hold the safety in the middle of the field during his five-step drop to set up the go route at the opposite boundary. He’ll \nrecognize the high safety following the intermediate crosser and target the post that’s open against the second high safety on the other \nside.  \nGabriel finds the hole in Cover 3 downfield and can layer the ball over shallow and intermediate coverage to the receiver breaking behind it. \nHe can deliver the ball with enough placement so the receiver can make a back-shoulder catch rather than taking a hit to the chest from an \noncoming safety.  \nHe has zone targets between defenders where he lacks confidence to pull the trigger when the coverage is favorable and targets between \ndefenders he anticipates that are unfavorable for the quarterback. He must improve his leverage reads of multiple defenders in a tight and \nshallow zone window.  \nGabriel feels blindside edge pressure within 1-2 steps of him. He will roll past blindside and frontside edge pressure to the open flat. \nUnfortunately, Gabriel is also reactive to edge pressure when it’s coming hot and fast from a secondary defender or linebacker and it \ndisrupts the flow and pace he should take to maneuver it intelligently.  \nOtherwise, Gabriel will work through 2-3 reads, identify pressure compromising the pocket, and buy time away from the pocket to find an \nopen option or run. Still, Gabriel misses solutions for maneuvering within the pocket when there are two points of pressure. He rolls to the \nsame side of the field where nothing had come open earlier and cuts off the other side of the field where receivers were running open.  \nGabriel is reactive to edge pressure and his first reaction is to retreat and/or bolt the pocket to the outside rather than climb the pocket. He \nhas missed opportunities to climb and at least target check-downs as a result. He has taken sacks in the black zone because of this \nbehavior.  \nHe has moments where he’s comfortable in the pocket. Against bookend edge pressure, Gabriel can incrementally climb and find an open \ndig route against zone. When there’s interior pressure but not arriving directly in his face, Gabriel can sidestep the pressure in the pocket, \nreset, and deliver to a deep target downfield against Cover 0.  \nGabriel can maneuver too close to his blockers and defenders when there was no need and generate pressure that wasn’t there. On the \nother hand, he can sidestep and climb pressure on top of him in a tight pocket and find the check down.  \nIf Gabriel can parse the issues that accompany his strengths in the same areas of his game, he could become a compelling backup. He has \nthe game competitive nature and creative tendencies that, with work, might help him transcend his current value.  \n \nDrops: He has a quick, precise, and balanced one-step drop/setup from Pistol. Gabriel has a smooth three-step and five-step drops from \nPistol. His seven-step drop from center is well-paced and precise.  \nBall Security: When Gabriel breaks the pocket, the ball drifts below his waist and outside his frame. When he encounters a defender \npursuing him downhill, Gabriel tucks the ball tighter to his chest and gets his elbow to his side. However, the security isn’t tight enough in \neither way and he has lost the ball on short-yardage keepers after taking a hard hit from a box defender. Gabriel also has an effective pitch \nfake.  \nPlay Fakes: Gabriel is patient with holding the ball into the chest of the back on read plays. He doesn’t sell the boot pass as thoroughly as \nhe can, but it’s effective for RPOs.  \nHe delivers a good play fake with his back to the defense off a seven-step drop from center to his back in the I-formation.  \nPump Fakes: Gabriel has a full-motion pump fake with one hand that has moderate violence. He uses it when rolling outside and setting up \ndefenders to either pass or run. When rolling to his left, Gabriel can deliver a violent full-motion pump fake. He can also deliver a shoulder \nfake.  \nRelease: Gabriel steps into his release with a bent front knee. The midline of his back foot and toe of his front foot are aligned with the \ntarget.  \n\n \n102 \nGabriel brings the ball below his chest—nearly to his waist—before bringing it behind his shoulder and helmet. The arc of the release is a \nthree-quarter motion outside his shoulder. He rotates his hips downhill to generate velocity. Gabriel can deliver in the RPO game with his \nfeet parallel to each other and his hips facing the target while using a sidearm release.  \nAccuracy (No Pressure) \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Gabriel can deliver a pinpoint go route covering 50 yards from the pitch off a five-step drop. He displays \ngood placement against off-coverage throwing the short slant so only the receiver can make the play.  \nGabriel drives the ball well on the deep post covering 40 yards from the pitch. He also has good timing and placement with fade \nroutes at the pylons or the boundary.  \nThe limits of his range up the near-side boundary are between 50-55 yards. \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Based on his work under pressure, Gabriel has potential for pinpoint short-range accuracy but more \nrealistically, catchable accuracy.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: He can deliver the ball 48 yards to the opposite boundary with pinpoint accuracy.  \nMobile Accuracy: He can misjudge trailing coverage when on the move and targeting a receiver breaking across the flat to the \nboundary 20 yards away. He’s had defenders jump the target and undercut it.  \nDecision-Making: Gabriel can take too long to come off his first read when there are two defenders with excellent leverage to stop a quick \nslant. He’ll stare down the first read until there’s a defender in his face, if not sacking him.  \nGabriel will hold the safety in the middle of the field during his five-step drop to set up the go route at the opposite boundary. He’ll \nrecognize the high safety following the intermediate crosser and target the post that’s open against the second high safety on the other \nside.  \nGabriel can work from his first read at the boundary, recognize the safety has good coverage, turn to his second read over the middle, and \nplace the ball in stride to the receiver on the intermediate dig route. \nGabriel finds the hole in Cover 3 downfield and can layer the ball over shallow and intermediate coverage to the receiver breaking behind it. \nHe can deliver the ball with enough placement so the receiver can make a back-shoulder catch rather than taking a hit to the chest from an \noncoming safety.  \nGabriel has zone targets between defenders where he lacks confidence to pull the trigger when the coverage is favorable and targets \nbetween defenders he anticipates that are unfavorable for the quarterback. He must improve his leverage reads of multiple defenders in a \ntight and shallow zone window. He can find his third read after working incrementally across the field.  \nSense Pressure: Gabriel feels blindside edge pressure within 1-2 steps of him. He will roll past blindside and frontside edge pressure to the \nopen flat. Unfortunately, Gabriel is also reactive to edge pressure when it’s coming hot and fast from a secondary defender or linebacker \nand it disrupts the flow and pace he should take to maneuver it intelligently.  \nGabriel will work through 2-3 reads, identify pressure compromising the pocket, and buy time away from the pocket to find an open option \nor run.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Gabriel misses solutions for maneuvering within the pocket when there are two points of pressure. He rolls \nto the same side of the field where nothing had come open earlier and cuts off the other side of the field where receivers were running \nopen.  \nGabriel is reactive to edge pressure and his first reaction is to retreat and/or bolt the pocket to the outside rather than climb the pocket. He \nhas missed opportunities to climb and at least target check-downs as a result. He has taken sacks in the black zone because of this \nbehavior.  \nHe has moments where he’s comfortable in the pocket. Against bookend edge pressure, Gabriel can incrementally climb and find an open \ndig route against zone. When there’s interior pressure but not arriving directly in his face, Gabriel can sidestep the pressure in the pocket, \nreset, and deliver to a deep target downfield against Cover 0. He’s pinpoint off the sidestep at 46 yards to the go route up the flat.  \nGabriel can maneuver too close to his blockers and defenders when there was no need and generate pressure that wasn’t there. He can \nsidestep and climb pressure on top of him in a tight pocket and find the check down.  \nAccuracy (Pressure) \n\n \n103 \nOn-Platform Accuracy: Gabriel can sidestep interior pressure and deliver a pinpoint go route up the flat covering 46 yards from \nthe pitch. Although not an anticipatory throw with timing routes, he anticipates where he should lead the receiver on vertical routes \nand does it well with pressure up the middle.  \nOff-Platform Accuracy: Gabriel can get the ball over a blitzing defender with a jump pass covering 10-12 yards to his open \noption in the zone flat. He can climb and throw to the opposite flat with general accuracy at 23 yards.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: With a defender in his face, Gabriel can deliver the out against man coverage to the opposite boundary \nin stride to the receiver covering 20 yards.  \nMobile Accuracy: Gabriel can deliver accurate routes in the shallow range of the field working to his left or right. He delivers to \nhis left 35 yards from the pitch in stride to his receiver with pressure in his face. \nDecision-Making: Gabriel is not a strong anticipatory thrower, especially when defenses blitz. He either doesn’t recognize or have \nconfidence in favorable leverage between zone defenders on a stop route when the defense is sending five players to the pocket. Good \nplacement between the defenders on the route earns an easy completion. Instead, Gabriel comes off the first read and when the check-\ndown is covered, it’s often too late for him to leave the pocket.  \nHe must manage black-zone situations (backed up inside his own 20) better. He’s reactive to pressure, trying to bolt the pocket and it costs \nhim opportunities to deliver targets to open options with room to run. \nGabriel will spot the pre-snap hole in coverage against pressure and look/throw to that read early to maximize the potential of the play. He \ncan draw a blitzing defender offside and take advantage of that situation for an easy play. He’ll find the easy open option versus Cover 0 \nblitzes for a big play. \nWhen Gabriel is stationary in the pocket with pressure bearing down, he’ll throw the ball away. Although he didn’t throw the ball away at all \nagainst Boise State, he managed to throw the ball away multiple times in other viewings—on the run or from the pocket. If it’s on the run, \nit’s when he has run out of room on a roll toward the boundary. If he thinks he can reverse field or weave into an open space in the pocket \na second or third time, he forgoes the throwaway and it’s often a mistake.  \nGabriel can work through 2-3 reads, break the pocket, and find a receiver working to get open. When the pocket compresses after 1-2 \nreads, Gabriel can be unsure about what he sees as he turns to the opposite side of the field. This leads to hesitation with pulling the trigger \nand tipping off his intentions with a pump fake and stare-down. It then can lead to him forcing the ball after tipping off his intentions.  \nGabriel can also unwittingly create open receivers with his pocket movement but not put two and two together with how his climb or slide to \none side of the field influenced the flat defender and opened the field for the receiver Gabriel just turned away from.  \nScrambling: Gabriel has the quickness to beat two points of pressure when he rolls outside the pocket. He has opportunities to buy time in \nthe pocket, but takes the outside path to his team’s detriment. Gabriel can spin and pull through the reach of a defender blitzing off the \nedge and break the pocket.  \nRunning: Gabriel can make the first defender coming downhill miss as he transitions from a sideline track to a downhill track. He can make \nthat transition with two quick steps.  \nGabriel is willing to slide to avoid hits. If there’s no room to slide, he’ll drop his pads to get under hits. If forced to drop his pads in short \nyardage to win a collision against an edge defender, Gabriel can do it.  \nDurability: Broken left clavicle (throwing shoulder) in mid-September that cost Gabriel the rest of 2021. He did not require surgery. This \nwas the only significant injury he sustained between 2020-2024.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Gabriel from afar.  \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nIds safety biting on crosser and threads needle on deep post \n• \nBlitz reactive, pocket and situational mismanagement \n• \nMust self-scout limits of his game and limits of coverage \n• \nPlacement in the middle of the field \n• \nDeep game: 48 yards opposite boundary \n• \nClimbs pocket, patient with zone routes, pinpoint in-breaker \n• \nClimb, throw in rhythm, opposite flat, general accuracy \n• \nSkinny post: manipulates flat defenders, layered and placed to protect WR \n• \nManeuvering pocket/pressure in black zone, layers throw, pinpoint \n• \nThird read as pocket compresses and fits it into tight coverage \n\n \n104 \nQB Rankings and Comparisons Table \n \nNote: Times and measurements are from the NFL Combine or Pro Day workouts. “Potential” is my assessment of the player’s \ndevelopmental curve becoming the best player he can be. It is based on the potential for the athlete to improve his strength and athleticism \nwith additional training or learn the techniques and concepts of his position.  \n \n \nIn theory, player comparisons are a reader-friendly way to get a clearer mental picture of a player’s physical build, athleticism, technical \nskills, and potential. In practice, this is a hit-or-miss process that, at the very least, is an entertaining exercise. Each “-“ is an approximate \nlevel of separation between one player’s talent and the next. The “X” is where the player falls along this spectrum of comparison. A “/” \nmeans the player’s talents are similar. \n \nThe key word is “talent,” because there are some players with lesser careers listed ahead of more famous or productive peers. This is my \nsubjective interpretation of talent and not success. For example, I had Johnny Manziel ahead of Baker Mayfield on a spectrum of comparison \nfor Zach Wilson on this list. Mayfield has already had the better career, but I believe Manziel’s film showed star-caliber potential that \nMayfield’s lacked.  \n \nAbbreviations Key (L-R): Height, Weight, 40-yard dash, 20-Shuttle, 3-Cone, Vertical, and Hand Size.  \n \nTier \nRank \nName \nHt. \nWt. \nSchool \n40 \n20S \n3C \nV \nH \nDepth \nBreadth \nNon-\nAdjusted \nComments \nComparison \nPotential \nI \nQB1 \nCam Ward \n6'1\" \n219 \nMiami / Washington St. \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \n9 \n79.325 \n88.7313 \n68.35 \nWard has a \nwhip-like \nrelease and the \nskill to deliver \nthe ball with a \nvariety of \nplatforms.

Displays pinpoint accuracy on deep throws when on-platform and shows the ability to layer throws over coverage. Can manipulate safeties to open up downfield throws.  Possesses good pocket mobility and can extend plays.  Has a quick, precise, and balanced drop from various formations.  Effective pitch fake.\n\n* **Opportunities:**  Improving his release mechanics to speed up his delivery.  Needs to improve his decision-making, particularly when facing pressure; he tends to stare down his first read and become reactive instead of proactive. Needs to develop more confidence and anticipate favorable leverage in zone coverage. Needs to improve his pocket maneuverability, especially when facing multiple points of pressure.  Must improve his handling of black-zone situations (within his own 20).  Needs better anticipation against blitzes.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** The report lists Drew Brees and Russell Wilson as comparisons, but acknowledges a significant gap between Gabriel and those high-level players.  The comparison suggests his strengths are similar, but he has much to improve to reach their level. The \"----X\"  notation indicates he is considerably below them in overall talent.
