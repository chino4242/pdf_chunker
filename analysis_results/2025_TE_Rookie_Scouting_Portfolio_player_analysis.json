Buckle up. It will all click into place. I swear… \n \nTight ends aren’t real. My co-host, Adam Harstad, and I discussed this point in 2022. We called them unicorns. We should have \nlabeled them sport’s version of the chimera – a mythical fire-breathing female monster with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a \ndragon’s wings. \n \nAfter all, a glass-eating fullback with the size, strength, agility, and technique of a small offensive tackle that can – oh, by the way – \nrun routes and operate in the open field like a running back, slot receiver, flanker, and split end is wildly imaginative. As dazzling as \nRob Gronkowski was as football’s chimera for over a decade, the long-term demands are implausible.   \n \n\n \n25 \nGronkowski played 11 seasons – 5 times, he missed at least a quarter of each season with injuries. He only played an entire season \nthree times.  \n \nGeorge Kittle arguably qualifies for mythical status at the position. Kittle has the skills to do it all. I’m not sure he meets the \nstandard of application at the line of scrimmage demanded of Gronkowski. Kittle has missed 18 games in 8 years due to injury, only \nplaying an entire season twice.  \n \nThe demands of his hybrid role stretch the capabilities of the body too thin for most to perform. The fact we’ve seen two players in \nthe past 15 years deliver a combined 6-8 seasons on this mythical scale is phenomenal. \n \nThe next tier down – where humans dwell – is where we find T.J. Hockenson. A capable blocker who isn’t asked to work on an island \nagainst front-side defensive ends with the regularity of Gronowski, Hockenson can also earn upwards of 85-95 receptions, 950 yards, \nand 6 scores.  \n \nHockenson may not be the top weapon in his passing game but as one of the top three options in his offense, he can pace an offense \nin any given week.  \n \nTrey McBride’s recent production could be another potential career arc, but that will require a team to dial back the blocking \nrequirements and amp up the receiving workload. It also requires a quarterback fixated one option to the detriment of his offense.  \n \nAs an aside, I hear that quarterbacks addicted to Call of Duty can experience low motivation, lack of productivity, poor relationships \nwith others, or struggles with work performance. Last October, a gentleman even conducted a statistical analysis linking the Impact \nof Call of Duty Releases on Kyler Murray Quarterback Rating. The analyst acquitted Murray on the letter of the law but if this were a \ntrial, he might not be sleeping well at night with that decision.   \n \nThat brings us to Loveland. He’s one of two tight ends in this draft class with a remote chance of becoming the NFL’s next pair of \nchimeras, but don’t get your hopes up. Most likely, they’ll land in that next tier below with aspirations for a Hockenson role.  \n \nLoveland looks like a chimera on a college field. On any given Saturday in Ann Arbor, Loveland can be found winning dig routes \nagainst man coverage, earning chunks of yardage after the catch, sealing front-side defensive ends, and leaping over corners and \nsafeties on back-shoulder fades.  \n \nFaster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and leaps over tall buildings in a single bound? Sure, Loveland is a \nBig Ten Superman. So was Hockenson.  \n \nTo become a true NFL chimera, we’ll need to see Loveland add Gronkowski weight and it’s unlikely we’ll see that transformation. \nWhile that may appear as a win for those wishing for the NFL to dial down Loveland’s blocking while amping up the receiving, his \nlanding spot will matter.  \n \nLoveland may prove too good at the line of scrimmage to get roles on par with Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Sam LaPorta, or Mark \nAndrews. This is unlikely in today’s league that values receiving tight ends, but it’s possible and noteworthy.  \n \nMore likely, we’ll see Loveland eventually earn a role as one of his team’s top-three receiving options. He’s a capable route runner \nwho can stretch any part of the field against zone or man-to-man. He also does damage after the catch as an option who leaks into \nthe open zone after assisting at the line of scrimmage.  \n \nLoveland is one of the best talents among the skill positions in this class. At the same time, one of those talents might anchor him to \nthe line of scrimmage more often than Brock Bowers, whose game as a blocker isn’t as deep as Loveland’s.  \n \nBowers is one of the most explosive athletes at the position that we’ve seen in a long time who can also perform receiving duties at \nthe highest level. He’s one of one.  \n \nFrom a football standpoint, Loveland can have as much value as Bowers but expressed with greater versatility away from the box \nscore.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? Recognizing holes in zone coverage. Countering the hands of defensive lineman in the run \ngame. \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Loveland doesn’t always approach linemen with a balanced stance from an inline position. He’s \nprone to overextending his frame and getting thrown aside early.  \n\n \n26 \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Loveland succeeded Erick All at Michigan, he’d be a nice fit for Cincinnati if All can’t make it back \nfrom his latest injury. Tyler Higbee hasn’t been able to stay healthy and outfitting Matthew Stafford with a Hockenson-like option in \nthe Rams’ offense that will likely part company with Cooper Kupp. \n \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? If Loveland lands on a team that wants to amp up his receiving usage with a Call of Duty addicted \nquarterback, he could rival Tre McBride’s peak production as a 100-catch/1,100-yard receiver.   \nWhat is his floor scenario? If a coaching staff values Loveland most as a run blocker and occasional play-action seam threat who \ngets the bulk of his receiving work leaking into the shallow zones, 70-80 catches and 700-900 yards may prove a more realistic \nceiling.  \nPhysical: Loveland holds up as a physical runner, winning collisions with defensive backs and off-ball linebackers. He’ll earn yards \nafter contact. He gets his feet and knees high through contact, which also helps him break tackles.  \nTechnical: Loveland can drop his weight into breaks. He must work on applying this skill to a greater variety of breaks so he \nmaximizes the potential of his route running against man-to-man coverage and tighter zones that he’ll encounter in the NFL.  \nConceptual: He doesn’t always aim for the correct shoulder when sealing a defender at the line of scrimmage. \nIntuitive: Loveland is good at using his eyes and body language to community with his quarterback when working off-script. \nBuild: Loveland is currently in that Kittle-Hockenson range of dimensions and will likely remain there. \nReleases: Loveland has a staggered stance when detached from the line of scrimmage. His weight distribution is 80/20 favoring his \nfront foot. His hands rest at the top of his knee.  \nLoveland sinks into his stance and rocks off his back foot before rolling off his front foot with his pads over his knees. He has reps \nwhere he doesn’t waste motion when coming off the line of scrimmage. He sells the vertical with his stem effectively.  \nLoveland reduces his shoulder from inside shade that he attacks during his release. He has an effective read step, double up or two \nquick against outside leverage. He has an effective diamond release with a read step and two-quick combo with a wipe counter. He \ncounters the hands of coverage with a wipe, shed, or swat. \nSeparation: Loveland has the acceleration and long speed to beat safeties up the seam and the length and athletic ability to win \ncontested targets against most defensive backs in one-on-one scenarios on the perimeter.  \nRoute Stems: Loveland will widen his stems to attack outside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Loveland uses his eyes to sell defenders at the top of stems. He has an effective peek to sell the fade or out before \ncontinuing up the boundary.  \nRoute Breaks: On shallow speed turns, Loveland has a long break step, flat drive step, and flat line step. He gets his head around \nearly during the break, runs out the break, and finishes with a friendly position to the quarterback.  \nLoveland has a drop and pop break but the weight drop can be deeper so there’s sudden deceleration. He has a long break step into \nthe deceleration phase, but not sudden enough deceleration.  \nLoveland earns a small amount of weight drop into whip routes but the route needs more bend. He is smooth in and out of the \nbreak.  \nLoveland can snap his turns on breaks inside or outside. He punches the boundary arm to generate much of that suddenness with \nthe turn.  \nZone Routes: Loveland identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When working a vertical \nzone, Loveland tempos his breaks and doesn’t show his eyes until he has cleared the buzz/rollover defender. Loveland has some \nsnap with his turns back to the quarterback. He can cultivate this more with the punch of his boundary-side arm.  \nIf his first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work to an open area. he does a good job using his eyes to communicate with a \nquarterback off-script.  \nRoute Boundary: Loveland is aware of the boundary, but when high-pointing he can have trouble getting one foot in bounds. He \ncan toe-tap both feet in bounds with corner routes thrown above his head.  \n\n \n27 \nPass Tracking: Loveland extends over his head for the ball without leaving his feet. He tracks short vertical targets over his \nshoulder. He can also extend behind his break over his back shoulder for a target without leaving his feet where he might have been \nbetter off turning back to the target and continuing the turn inside to get downhill.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Loveland high points targets with good position/control of his frame. He catches targets at his back hip with \nunderhand attack and turns against his break path to make the play.  \nLoveland also attacks the ball away from his frame and will extend his upper body beyond his legs and hips to earn the ball. \nLoveland has lapses where he clap-attacks targets with underhand position at his back hip and drops the target. He attacks the ball \nat the earliest point of arrival when the ball is arriving near his frame and he’s in a static position facing the ball.  \nPosition: Loveland can high point over a defender’s back, execute a pull-down away from an oncoming defender and take a hit to \nhis back.  \nFocus: Loveland can take contact to his back or chest. He wins targets against tight coverage. \nTransitions: Loveland catches and pierces downhill. With some throws arriving behind his break path, he’ll obey the ball and \ntransition as he’s making the catch.  \nElusiveness: Loveland can get his knees high and feet over low shots in the open field. He sticks his foot in the ground against \nbackside pursuit and reverses field to shake them. While wrapped, Loveland can spin away from contact coming across the field to \ndeliver a hit.  \nVision: Loveland runs to open space, whether it’s against a single pursuer or working through traffic with blockers. He’s patient with \nsetting up blocks and he’s skilled and splitting blocks. He can create with or without blockers and he’s wise about risks as a decision-\nmaker.  \nPower: Loveland has an effective stiff-arm to ward off reaches to his torso. He can drag defenders wrapped around him.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Loveland wins collisions with safeties with downhill runways into collisions with his pads.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Loveland bounces off glancing shots from linebackers and safeties hitting his thighs and hips. He has an \neffective balance-touch that helps him earn additional yardage.  \nBall Security: Loveland has lapses where he doesn’t secure the ball immediately to his chest. Instead, he holds the ball with both \nhands like a pitchman in an option scheme. Loveland has fumbled the ball without any forced error because he failed to secure the \nball early. When he has the ball secure, he can take a hit to his ball-carrying arm from a defensive tackle coming down the line.  \nBlocking: From an inline stance, Loveland comes off low, but overextends into the defensive end and gets thrown aside because \nhe’s off-balance. When Loveland doesn’t overextend, he can counter the hands of his opponent and work his hands into the frame of \nthe defensive end. This is something he’s good at doing and it leads to a stalemate between the two opponents because Loveland \nhas a wide and balanced stance.  \nWhen pinning a defensive end inside on a perimeter run to his side, Loveland eliminates the gap between himself and the defender’s \npads. His hand placement is effective and he can anchor his position when the defender’s hips aren’t square to Loveland’s.  \nWhen executing wind back or lead blocks to the opposite edge, Loveland’s aiming point should be the inside shoulder, but he has \ntaken the outside shoulder and lost the interaction early. When he takes the inside shoulder, his ball carrier benefits.   \nLoveland can combo block with a double-team to the defensive end and peel to the linebacker downhill. He can strike the linebacker \nwith an uppercut punch and roll through his hips.  \nDurability: Missed Week 4 in 2024 with a shoulder injury and then missed additional games after injuring his shoulder against \nNorthwestern in the first half. He had labrum repair and AC joint reconstruction and should be ready for full participation in late July. \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you’re seeking the next Brock Bowers, stop, turn around, and go home. The comps to Bowers \nare for SEO and product sales, or for those who don’t see the differences in athletic ability. Bowers has the athletic prowess to \nbecome a perennial top-three option at the position and have Travis Kelce-like peaks that equate to top-10 fantasy WR production.  \n \nThink more along the lines of Loveland as a potential Hockenson-like option who can give you top-five fantasy production in a peak \nyear once or twice during their career – value that might equate to top-15 or top-20 fantasy value among WRs – but more likely a \nsolid top-12 tight end in the range of 700-900 yards and 5-7 scores.  \n \nLoveland is a first-round value in 1.5 PPR scoring formats for tight ends. In standard PPR formats, Loveland would be a better value \nin the back half of the second round. In non-PPR formats, the back half of the third round. \n\n \n28 \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nAstute tracking, stiff arm, high knees/feet, contact balance \n• \nTurning DE away from ball carrier with good counter with hands and leverage \n• \nGood speed turn, scramble drill, high-point vs contact, and good positioning post-catch \n• \nImpressive mobility and tracking \n• \nColston Loveland Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n29",
        "analysis": "Colston Loveland is a highly-rated tight end prospect (RSP TE1) with a unique blend of skills.  His profile highlights a potential for both high-level receiving and blocking, leading to a wide range of projected NFL outcomes.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Versatility:** Loveland excels as both a receiver and blocker, a rare combination. He possesses the size and strength to handle in-line blocking duties, while also displaying impressive route-running skills, agility, and ability to make plays after the catch.  His ability to win in various ways gives him a high ceiling.\n* **Receiving Prowess:** He demonstrates exceptional hands, high-pointing ability, and the capacity to win contested catches. He shows good route-running technique, recognizing zone coverages and creating separation.  His ability to secure pinpoint targets is a significant asset.\n* **Blocking Ability:** While his receiving skills are highly touted, his blocking skills are also a considerable strength. He effectively seals defenders, and shows the potential to excel in run blocking if he improves his consistency in maintaining balance.\n* **Physicality:** Loveland is a powerful runner who wins collisions and breaks tackles. He utilizes high knees and feet to maintain balance through contact.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Reaching Full Potential:** His ceiling is high, but reaching it hinges on his development and landing spot.  Improving consistency in his blocking technique (especially maintaining balance) and further refining his route-running against tighter NFL coverages will be key.\n* **Scheme Fit:** His success will depend on finding a team that utilizes his skill set effectively. A team that values a receiving tight end and doesn't overly rely on him for heavy blocking duties would maximize his value.\n* **Injury History:** He suffered a shoulder injury requiring surgery, impacting his availability.  His future durability is a factor to consider.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe profile draws comparisons to a spectrum of players:\n\n* **High Ceiling (Mythical):** George Kittle and Rob Gronkowski –  These comparisons highlight his potential for exceptional all-around play, but the profile acknowledges the rarity and injury risks associated with this level of dual-threat performance.  It suggests Loveland is less likely to reach this level due to needing to add weight to better match Gronkowski's physique.\n* **More Realistic Comparison:** T.J. Hockenson – This is considered his most likely landing point.  He projects as a capable blocker who can also be a significant receiving threat, potentially becoming one of the top three options in a passing game.\n* **Lower Ceiling:** Trey McBride – This represents a scenario where his blocking is prioritized over receiving, limiting his overall fantasy value.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nLoveland is a highly talented tight end prospect with a potentially high reward, but also significant risk. His success will depend on his continued development, overcoming injuries, and the right scheme fit in the NFL.  While a Kittle/Gronkowski-level impact is unlikely, a Hockenson-level career is within reach.\n"

Taylor has a higher ceiling as a blocker and it means \nthere is a greater range of potential scheme fits in the NFL. It also means there’s a wider range of outcomes for Taylor’s receiving \noutput.  \nMark Andrews is in a unique situation. There are no quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson, and Andrews played in an offense for several \nyears that elevated the tight end as the primary option in the passing game.  \nIf Andrews landed elsewhere in the NFL, I have no doubt he’d be capable of earning 500-700 yards and 4-6 scores a year. In \nBaltimore, a healthy Andrews is in range of 700-900 yards and 7-9 scores—not counting his 1,300-yard peak.  \n\n \n30 \nStill, we can hope and that’s what fans love about the NFL Draft. Based on the film, Taylor offers plenty of hope that the NFL fans will \nsee a player with a baseline of value on par with Andrews.  \nTaylor is a smooth athlete and it shows up in every facet of his game. As a blocker, Taylor has a knack for hooking and turning his \nassignments on the perimeter. He’s good with his hands at the line of scrimmage, countering his opponent’s counters to earn a good \nangle to force the defender away from the rushing lane. He’s also light-footed in pass protection, which helps him slide laterally to \nwall-off opponents.  \nAs a route runner, Taylor has a solid grasp of release footwork and upper-body counters to work past defenders and into his \npatterns. He drops his weight effectively with specific breaks, and he has flat speed turns for in- and out-breaking routes.  \nTaylor makes extensions for targets appear effortless whether it’s going high or low for the ball. After the catch, Taylor has \ncurvilinear speed to weave through traffic, often creating yardage against unblocked defenders as if he had multiple blockers.  \nNone of this is to say Taylor is all finesse and no physicality. Taylor has good strikes at the line of scrimmage. He can uppercut and \nroll through his hips to generate force while establishing and sustaining control over his opponents.  \nTaylor takes hard shots at the catch point and earns the ball, and he can win collisions with corners, safeties, and linebackers.  \nThe only discernible differences between Taylor and Loveland is that Loveland has a little more upside as a run blocker and he’s \nmore powerful as a ball carrier. Neither difference is significant, and it’s possible Loveland never reaches that upside and Taylor \nmakes strength gains that match or exceed Loveland. \nIt’s well within the realm of possibility that Taylor earns a better scheme fit than Loveland and has a bigger role in their respective \npassing offenses. Considering that Loveland is regarded as the earlier pick, that may prove a bargain. \nWhere has the player improved? He has shown more versatility as a lead blocker as the years progressed. Taylor can often \nhandle multiple defenders during the course of a lead block, especially at the edge of the defense.  \nWhere is the player inconsistent? He swings the ball in the open field and his carriage can be tighter. \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Taylor fits well in any of the West Coast schemes that work the tight end up the seam, over routes, \nand dig routes with a play-action component but also needs a tight end who can lead the way on perimeter blocks for Toss or Wind \nBack. He’ll also be productive on tight end screens and throwbacks. \nIf a team is predominantly a spread system, Taylor can detach and work the slot or outside and exploit mismatches there. Think \nZach Ertz or Travis Kelce in function.  \nOn the opposite end of the spectrum a run-heavy attack that can be multiple in its alignments – think Kansas City, New England, or \nBaltimore’s sets with two tight ends that can convert to a variety of sets at moment’s notice – Taylor has the versatility to function \nas the primary receiving tight end.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? While remote, Taylor could offer Kittle’s upside as a receiver if his speed and ball carrying translate \nbetter than I’ve projected.  \nWhat is his floor scenario? Taylor is asked to bulk up, block more, run fewer routes, and plays with an unimaginative coordinator \nand limited quarterback. In this case, reaching 500 yards receiving might be an accomplishment.  \nPhysical: Taylor can square and anchor against lighter edge defenders as a backside run or pass blocker. \nTechnical: There are targets with lapses where Taylor makes small clap-attacks with targets that are high and away from his frame. \nHe begins with his extension of his arms with his hands together but they come apart midway through and he’s forced to execute a \nsmall clap of the target.  \nConceptual: Taylor is patient with setting up lead blocks, pressing one side within 1-2 steps of the blocker. He can create additional \nyardage in the open field with one blocker and multiple defenders in pursuit. \nIntuitive: Taylor has a good feel for working with his quarterback in zone coverage when the play goes off-schedule.  \nBuild: Taylor has the size of a prototypical receiving tight end who won’t be a liability at the line of scrimmage. \nReleases: Taylor uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. He sinks into his stance to begin his \nrelease and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion.  \n\n \n31 \nTaylor uses a one-step stretch from the line to attack outside leverage and then work up the seam. He’ll use a two-quick with a \nswat-swim counter against inside leverage. He’ll also reduce this shoulder against outside shade when coming off the line from a \nthree-point stance.  \nWhen working as a detached receiver, Taylor has a two-quick release or a double up with a wipe counter to attack the outside \nleverage of a defender. His footwork lacks the artistry of patience and suddenness. The wipe can have more violence.  \nTaylor counters an edge defender’s hands with a shed or shoulder reduction. He can stack a flat defender playing man in C2.  \nSeparation: Taylor has the acceleration and speed to pull away from linebackers and turn the short corner on box defenders. In the \nopen field, he can pull away from safeties who aren’t over the top but at his depth as the chase begins. \nRoute Stems: Taylor dives inside against inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Taylor will take the back of an off-coverage defender to set up breaks.  \nRoute Breaks: Taylor gets his head around early as he makes his break. He has a long break step into a speed turn with a flat drive \nstep. He’s also capable of delivering a flat line step.  \nTaylor can drop his weight into a whip route. \nZone Routes: Taylor identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the open zone. He waits to \nshow his eyes to the quarterback until he has earned enough depth from the buzz/rollover defender.  \nTaylor will also settle into the open zone with routes that break back to the quarterback. When his first break doesn’t earn a target, \nhe’ll work to the next open area.  \nRoute Boundary: Taylor is aware of the boundary on out-breaking routes and gets both feet tapped inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: Taylor tracks the ball over his shoulder. \nHands/Catch Radius: Taylor can extend his arms fully to the ball arriving over his shoulder and use overhand attack with targets \naway from his chest while on the move.  \nTaylor digs out throws below his knees with a full extension of his frame with underhand position. Taylor also extends behind his \nbreak path with over routes and crossing routes.  \nThere are targets with lapses where Taylor makes small clap-attacks with targets that are high and away from his frame. He begins \nwith his extension of his arms with his hands together but they come apart midway through and he’s forced to execute a small clap \nof the target.  \nTaylor can high point in a tight zone and take contact to his back.  \nPosition: Taylor can embrace the fall when extending parallel with the ground for a target.  \nFocus: Taylor can take a wrap to his chest or back as he secures the football. He also takes hard shots to this hip and back when \nextending behind his break path to earn the ball.  \nTransitions: Taylor can catch and pierce downhill on routes breaking to the flat and boundary. He’ll turn through the catch point to \nobey the ball and make an efficient catch and pierce.  \nElusiveness: Taylor has impressive curvilinear movement to bend inside the cornerback on a full-speed transition from a perimeter \npath to a downhill path. He weaves through secondary defenders after the catch and can turn a short target into an addition 20-25 \nyards past 2-3 defenders.  \nVision: Taylor is patient with setting up lead blocks, pressing one side within 1-2 steps of the blocker. He can create additional \nyardage in the open field with one blocker and multiple defenders in pursuit. \nPower: He pulls through lower-body reaches. He leads with his pads into collisions with defensive backs. Taylor has an effective stiff \narm that forces defenders to shoot low.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Taylor can hit and spin off the direct collision with a cornerback.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Taylor wins collisions with cornerbacks, safeties, and linebackers. \n\n \n32 \nBall Security: Taylor carries the ball close to his chest. There is some swing of the ball in the open field. The elbow is loose from his \nside. \nBlocking: Taylor gets his hands inside linebackers at the line of scrimmage and earns a tight position with little gap between his \nframe and the defender’s. Taylor can turn the defender inside, force the linebacker off-balance and pancake.  \nTaylor also has well-balanced footwork and stances. Taylor can stalemate a linebacker rushing to his inside shoulder, and when the \ndefender redirects, Taylor can toss the off-balanced defender to the ground and release into a shallow zone route as an outlet.  \nTaylor can square and anchor against lighter edge defenders as a backside run or pass blocker. He can work to the second level, \nsquare, and turn a safety in the backside flat.  \nWhen a defensive end counters him in the run game, Taylor has some quick counters of his own to use the defender’s leverage to his \nadvantage. He can turn linebackers outside.  \nTaylor will find and wall off the linebacker entering the crease as backside puller on Counter. He’ll peel off first-level double-teams \nand wall-off a second-level defender on edge runs. He uses the one-arm technique effectively to spring runners into the secondary.  \nWhen Taylor works to the backside linebacker in the second level, Taylor aims for the outside shoulder, turns the defender inside and \npushes the defender into the pile.   \nAs a wind-back blocker, Taylor will square the chest of the linebacker and deliver his shoulder into the defender. He can also deliver \nan uppercut punch and roll through his hips. As a lead blocker, Taylor can hook a linebacker and turn him away from the ball carrier \nworking behind Taylor.  \nWhen pass protecting, Taylor can take the inside and fan outside against a defensive end, maintaining a balanced position as he \nslides outward when he knows he has help outside with the tackle waiting.  \nTaylor is effective as a run blocker against linebackers and some defensive ends. He’s also skilled at leading downfield and earning \nmultiple blocks.  \nDurability: No significant injuries. \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Loveland, Ty Warren, Elijah Arroyo, and Harold Fannin will receive as much, if not more, buzz in \nfantasy football circles, but Taylor’s fit could make him the best short-term and long-term option at the position in this draft. It \nmakes him a potential bargain.

That said, Bowers is at \nthe top end of the spectrum of playing style and athlete where Fannin resides.  \nBowers is more mobile, often tops 21 MPH on the field, and is more refined as a route runner and blocker. Fannin has additional \nroom for growth as a route runner and blocker, but he’s not as explosive – topping out at 20 MPH – and just a tier below Bowers as \na mover.  \nNone of that is bad, but developing into Bowers is a pipe dream for Fannin. A realistic aspiration might be Sam LaPorta.  \n\n \n34 \nThe difference for Fannin’s draft prospects? An NFL team will make it a priority to create around Bowers to maximize his elite athletic \nability.  \nThere’s a little more variation of outcome for LaPorta types. Detroit knew what LaPorta offered and adjusted its offense to exploit it. \nA long-time NFL scout and subscriber commended after reading my 2023 scouting report of LaPorta that I nailed the following \nassessment about NFL teams in regards to LaPorta types at the position:  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Seasons with 80-90 receptions, 900-1,100 yards, and 5-7 scores.  \nWhat is his floor scenario? LaPorta winds up on a team that wants to bulk him up and make him an in-line blocker \nbecause the coach and the GM are in a pissing contest and LaPorta rides the bench, plays special teams, or only sees cameo \nroles during the length of his first contract.  \nOur subscriber/former long-time scout explained that he’s seen a lot of tight ends fail because the coach fattened up a receiver to do \nan in-line tight end’s job just to prove a point to his front office.  \nThis is the risk for Fannin, a former wide receiver and safety in high school, who was far and away Bowling Green’s biggest offensive \nweapon. Fannin and LaPorta are both former wide receivers who transitioned to tight ends.  \nPre-draft they are essentially the same height and weight. Fannin delivered a 4.39-second, 20-Yard Shuttle and 6.97-second, 3-Cone \nDrill.  \nLaPorta delivered a 4.25-second 20-Yard Shuttle and a 6.91-second, 3-Cone Drill. His vertical leap was 35 inches – one more than \nFannin.  \nBased on how I group this workout data, LaPorta and Fannin are in the same tiers of performance for each drill mentioned above. \nThe greatest difference is the 40-Yard Dash. LaPorta’s 4.59-second performance is 0.01 seconds inside the Elite Tier. Fannin’s 4.71-\nsecond performance is 0.01 seconds outside the Starter Tier. \nIt’s the 40-Yard Dash that shutdown a lot of the pre-draft love for Fannin among the public. Should it, though? When reviewing the \nroutes Fannin ran at Bowling Green versus the routes LaPorta ran as a rookie in Detroit, the 40-Yard Dash results won’t matter \nmuch, if at all.  \nThe highlighted routes are patterns where the difference in the 40 could have some impact. These are 7 out of 32 routes tracked.  \nLaPorta  \nNumber \nPct \nFannin \nPct \nLaPorta  \nNumber \nPct \nFannin \nPct \nGo \n33 \n6% \n16 \n2% \nCorner Post \n3 \n1% \n0 \n0% \nPost Corner \n1 \n0% \n0 \n0% \nPost Corner \n10 \n2% \n27 \n3% \nCorner \n40 \n7% \n47 \n6% \nOver \n19 \n3% \n40 \n5% \nWheel \n0 \n0% \n8 \n1% \nDig  \n78 \n13% \n59 \n7% \nFlat Rail \n5 \n1% \n6 \n1% \nSluggo \n1 \n0% \n2 \n0% \nComeback \n4 \n1% \n4 \n0% \nSluggo Seam \n0 \n0% \n0 \n0% \nFade \n2 \n0% \n2 \n0% \nSlant Stop \n7 \n1% \n4 \n0% \nOut \n65 \n11% \n66 \n8% \nWhip In \n11 \n2% \n2 \n0% \nWhip out \n0 \n0% \n12 \n1% \nSlant   \n23 \n4% \n36 \n4% \nCircle \n0 \n0% \n1 \n0% \nSit \n30 \n5% \n32 \n4% \nHitch \n68 \n12% \n66 \n8% \nHole \n4 \n1% \n15 \n2% \nFlat Rail \n71 \n12% \n136 \n17% \nDrag \n71 \n12% \n98 \n12% \nPivot \n0 \n0% \n0 \n0% \nScreen \n4 \n1% \n46 \n6% \nJet \n2 \n0% \n1 \n0% \nTunnel \n1 \n0% \n7 \n1% \nGhost \n1 \n0% \n0 \n0% \nHB Angle \n0 \n0% \n0 \n0% \nSeam \n26 \n4% \n71 \n9% \nShovel \n0 \n0% \n10 \n1% \n  \nEven if you make the argument that these seven routes may constitute a smaller percentage of work, but the gravity of the results \nhave a large impact, let’s consider another measurement of speed into the equation: field tracking.  \n\n \n35 \nFannin’s career max speed at Bowling Green is 20.3 MPH and his average top speed for his fastest moments were between 19-19.5 \nMPH. LaPorta’s career max speed at Iowa was 21.1 MPH and his average top speed for his fastest moments were 19.6-20 mph. \nIt’s a mistake to look at Fannin’s speed numbers and say they are bad because they don’t match up exactly with LaPorta’s. It’s \ncorrect to look at Fannin’s data and know that his on-field measured speed meets the standard for NFL starters at the position and \nhis initial acceleration and change of direction exceed it.   \nYou compare a player’s data to the baseline standards and you consider whether this data matches his style of play and the \ndemands that will be placed on him. Dalvin Cook’s metrics fell below baseline standards in certain areas, but Cooks’ curvilinear style \nof movement didn’t match the drills that measure how fast a player cuts.  \nDo you grade a pastry chef on how well he cooks a steak just because he works in a kitchen with many of the same tools as a chef? \nAn NFL offense is a restaurant, what they choose to serve is up to them.  \nAlthough LaPorta’s vertical routes leading to huge games as a rookie will remain emblazoned in the minds of fantasy GMs for years, \nthe success of LaPorta’s game doesn’t hinge on speed. Most of these vertical wins came on long-developing play-action routes \nagainst zone. Routes Fannin could have won in the same situation.  \nThe final argument is what I’ll call the Isaiah Likely. Likely ran a 4.8-second, 40-Yard Dash. His 20-Shuttle time was 4.57 seconds \nand his 3-Cone Drill was 7.33 seconds. He leaped 36 inches with his vertical at 6’4”, 238 pounds.  \nLikely played at Coastal Carolina. Like Bowling Green, Coastal Carolina doesn’t have the training budget and facilities of a Big Ten \nprogram like Iowa. NFL teams understand this about players and if they see enough twitchiness from a small-school player, they \nknow a year or two in an NFL weight room will make up the difference.  \nThe success of LaPorta’s – and Fannin’s – game hinges on short-area acceleration, change-of-direction-quickness, and precision. In \nthis respect. Fannin’s physical resources offer more than enough for him to succeed in the same respects as LaPorta.  \nFannin has a competent release game from the line of scrimmage. He understands how to be patient but sudden with his \nmovements, and he’s quick enough to get opposing defenders on their heels at the beginning of a route.  \nThis enhances his ability to dictate the action. As long as there’s enough explosion to dictate the action, the precision is what will \ncarry the player to success with his routes.  \nFannin understands how to manipulate man and zone coverage during his stems and both styles of breaks – speed turns and weight-\ndrop – are good enough, right now.  \nAlthough I saw some drops and small technique lapses against tight coverage during one of my viewings of Fannin, these were minor \nlapses relative to the overall body of work I watched from three seasons at Bowling Green. Fannin has a good feel for tracking, \nattacking, and securing the football. As is the case with even the most technically sound NFL player, Fannin will have some lapses \nbut they aren’t bad habits.  \nAfter the catch, Fannin has functional power and contact balance in the open field. He’ll bounce off hits in the secondary and work \nthrough tackle attempts, but he’s not a speed/power mismatch.  \nWhat he is – and even more so than LaPorta – is a savvy mover who sets up defenders with excellent footwork and eliminates \npursuit angles. He may not be a running back in open space, but his patience and creativity with pursuit angles is arguably the best \nof the tight ends in this class.  \nLike LaPorta, blocking isn’t Fannin’s calling card as an NFL prospect, but there’s still room for realistic growth with his game and he \nshould develop into an effective situational blocker on the backside of formations, as a lead blocker, or double-teaming on the front \nside of plays.  \nA lot of this, Fannin can do right now. As a detached receiver, stalk blocks aren’t a problem.  \nThe biggest question for Fannin will be the biggest question that faces tight ends like him—will the offensive fit be conducive for \nstrong production? Based on the way the NFL is playing offense these days, there are two likely outcomes: 1) The team that drafts \nFannin knows exactly what he is and how to use him. Or, 2) The team that drafts Fannin has more egos than Congress and the \ninternal politics could kill Fannin’s potential.  \nBet on Option No. 1 (but be prepared for the idiot factor of Option No. 2). \nWhere has the player improved? Fannin has a wider and more balanced stance as a blocker.  \n\n \n36 \nWhere is the player inconsistent? While I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s inconsistent, there are isolated lapses with his attack \naway from his frame when handling contested targets.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? An offense that uses two tight ends and likes to use an extensive play-action game that features \nthrow-backs and other misdirection that allows quicker than fast receivers operating against underneath coverage an extra step to \nseparate and earn good position for yardage after the catch. Offenses that don’t lean on a big slot option at wide receiver and would \nprefer that option to be a tight end.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? A producer somewhere in the range of LaPorta and Delanie Walker capable of 800-1,100 yards and \n6-8 scores during a peak season. \nWhat is his floor scenario? A cameo option similar to Isaiah Likely in his current role with Baltimore where he can pace the team \nin any given week with his production, but won’t be counted on to do it weekly.  \nPhysical: Fannin can bounce off glancing shots from linebackers. He’s sturdy enough as a runner to earn yardage on screens and in \nthe secondary. \nTechnical: He can throw the ball 39 yards to the near-side boundary with catchable accuracy. Although it won’t be a weekly part of \na team’s game plan, Fannin could earn some trick plays on offense and special teams. \nConceptual: Fannin has shown that he makes small and productive adjustments to catchable targets lacking pinpoint accuracy, \nincluding reaching behind his break path – and doing so against tight coverage or imminent contact.  \nIntuitive: When his first break doesn’t earn a target, Fannin will work to find open space for his quarterback. He uncovers quickly \nwhile maintaining a friendly target.  \nBuild: Sam LaPorta/Delanie Walker archetype. \nReleases: Fannin has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront leg.  \nWhen he begins his release, Fannin sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. He has lapses where he \ntakes an unnecessary step with the front foot.  \nFannin counters the hands of coverage with a wipe.  \nWhen aligned outside against tight man coverage, Fannin uses a foot-switch, a shoulder reduction counter, and then a lean-in to set \nup a break to the inside. He uses a double up to set up an inside release against off-coverage.  \nFrom a three-point stance, Fannin uses a read step to attack outside leverage and counters with a violent shed. He also counters \nwith a wipe. \nFannin delivers a read step with a two-quick after it with a combination of patience and suddenness. His hip shift at the top of a stem \non a sail route against off-coverage also has a patient but sudden quality. He also uses it well on fade routes as a boundary option. \nSeparation: He’s quick enough up the seam to challenge the intermediate zone coverage and earn open space.  \nRoute Stems: Fannin widens stems to attack outside leverage. He’ll dive to attack inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Against safeties playing over the top of the seam, Fannin delivers a hard head fake and stick to the inside at the top \nof his stems. He has an effective stair-step against off-coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: When executing shallow out-breaking routes out of a break step, Fannin’s breaks are flat, but the drive step can be \nflatter. The line step is flat. He gets his head around quickly out of breaks.  \nFannin uses a three-step break on stop routes. He also uses a three-step break with effective weight drop into a flat turn on a dig – \nincluding a flat line step.  \nZone Routes: Fannin identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his break between the zones. He waits to \npass the buzz/rollover defender before showing his eyes to the quarterback.  \nFannin settles into the open area and presents a friendly target to the quarterback. He can snap his turns. He should do this more \noften. I only saw it once in four games that I charted.  \n\n \n37 \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Fannin will work to find open space for his quarterback. He uncovers quickly while \nmaintaining a friendly target.  \nRoute Boundary: Fannin is aware of the boundary and taps both feet inbounds on out-breaking routes.  \nPass Tracking: Fannin tracks the ball over his shoulder with underhand attack up the intermediate seam. He can track over his \nshoulder with overhand attack on breaks to the shallow flat. He doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily for targets arriving over his \nhead.  \nWhen he must leave his feet, he can fully extend his arms and earn the ball while high pointing it over his shoulder in tight coverage.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Fannin catches the ball over his shoulder with underhand attack. Even with a defender closing fast, Fannin \nextends his arms toward the defender and the ball and makes the catch away from his frame without distraction.  \nFannin attacks the ball at its earliest point with overhand and underhand position. He high points effectively. When he has lapses \nwith his hands, the ball is behind his break path and he has a small clap-attack with underhand position away from his frame.  \nFannin has shown that he makes small and productive adjustments to catchable targets lacking pinpoint accuracy, including reaching \nbehind his break path – and doing so against tight coverage or imminent contact.  \nPosition: Fannin will jump up and through with an early high point to keep the ball away from the defender. He retracts the ball \nquickly to his frame from the high point so coverage can’t knock it free. He embraces the fall.  \nFocus: Fannin can track the ball over his shoulder up the intermediate seam with a safety closing on Fannin from the middle of the \nfield and reaching for the ball. He can take a hit to his back from a trailing defender as he catches targets.  \nTransitions: Fannin catches and pierces downhill. He obeys the direction of the target to determine which way he catches and \npierces.  \nElusiveness: Fannin uses a stutter in the open field to freeze pursuit. He gets his feet over low shots.  \nFannin only needs two steps to transition from a downhill runway at full speed to a path 45 degrees inside the pursuit over the top. \nHe only needs two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter runway to the far-side edge.  \nHe can then use two steps to bounce back outside the defender he turned around.  \nFannin has an effective spin to transition downhill with no wasted movement. He can layer moves in the open field to set up \ndefenders.  \nFannin opens his hips efficiently to work away from pursuit in traffic. He has good curvilinear bend to work 90 degrees downhill to \nthe opposite tackle with just one step. He weaves tighter turns outside and inside and sometimes in succession, executing at good \nspeed.  \nVision: Fannin is a decisive runner with a downhill mentality, who will use moves to create space or freeze defenders. If those \nmoves don’t work, he takes the direct route to earn what he can get.  \nFannin has the peripheral vision to spot backside pursuit from over 20 yards away and make a move to buy time against that \ndefender and the defender over the top of him. He’s a patient and creative runner in open space.  \nHe can press to his blockers’ side of the field to set up safeties over the top and then cutback.  \nPower: Fannin has an effective stiff arm to ward off a defender’s reach to his frame. He keeps his feet moving when a defender \nwraps his lower leg. He can drag a defensive back 3-4 yards after the compact.  \nFannin can pull through wraps to his upper legs from defensive backs. He can pull through multiple reaches during a run.  \nHe uses a forearm shiver to initiate contact with defensive backs and knock them backward. Although Fannin bounces off some hits, \nhe’s not a pile mover unless he’s in the secondary and that may not prove the case in the NFL.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Fannin bounces off direct shots to his legs from safeties. He stalemates linebackers.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Fannin has an effective balance-touch so he can at least extend toward the marker or goal line as a \nrunner. He can bounce off a glancing shot to his frame from a linebacker with a downhill runway.  \n\n \n38 \nBall Security: Fannin uses the boundary-side arm to carry the ball. He carries the ball high to his chest but with the elbow wide of \nhis frame.  \nFannin has lapses where he tucks the ball under his right arm even when catching targets outside the left hash and pursuit is \nworking toward his right arm.   \nFannin can take contact to the ball and/or ball-carrying arm in the open field and maintain possession.  \nBlocking: When double-teaming an edge defender with a left tackle, Fannin will be the aggressor. He gets his hands into the chest \nof the opponent, earns a wide stance, and when the defender redirects, Fannin turns into the side of the defender and pushes the \ndefender in the direction the defender wants to go but past the path of the ball carrier.  \nFannin can hook a force defender by attacking the outside shoulder and turning the defender around. As a lead blocker, Fannin will \nwork into the crease and attack a linebacker or safety with a strike. He lacks a sound strike and because of his lack of size, Fannin \nloses the interaction early when the defender meets Fannin’s strike with a strike of his own.  \nWhen Fannin has a chance to peel off one assignment to deliver a hard strike with his pads to a defender in the area, he will.  \nAs a pass protector against edge defender, Fannin can overextend when initiating contact. He moves his feet fast enough to make up \nground on a defender redirecting off Fannin’s overextension.   \nAs a stalk blocker, Fannin earns a tight position to the target, makes contact with underhand position, and moves his feet to seal the \ndefender to a side.  \nDurability: No significant injuries. \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: The amount of time I spent arguing in favor of Fannin’s athletic merits should tell you that Fannin \nis a candidate to surprise as an early NFL contributor with the right fit. He’s a better risk with dynasty drafts that occur after the NFL \nDraft. If you want a tight end before the NFL Draft, consider the relative safety of Loveland, Taylor, Elijah Arroyo, or Tyler Warren.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nSeam route into oncoming safety \n• \n39-yard throw with catchable accuracy \n• \nOpen-field footwork and vision \n• \nStair-steps route for TD \n• \nDrops vs. tight coverage and clap drops \n• \nThree impressive catches and tracking examples \n• \nHarold Fannin, Jr. 2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n39",

Arroyo will be the eye candy of this tight end class. He’s the fastest tight end in this class \nand it doesn’t take a stop watch to determine it.  \n \nArroyo’s Depth of Talent Score is only a tenth of a point lower than Harold Fannin, Jr. If you prefer Arroyo, I have no vigorous \nargument against it. He’s bigger, stronger, and faster than Fannin, which means there are more potential places he’ll fit into a \nscheme and eventually earn extensive playing time. \n \nArroyo’s athletic ability could buy him opportunities early. If his new team creates a role that leverages his speed, hands, and agility \nin open space, he could have stretches of early production as a second tight end leveraging mismatches off a more established \noption.  \n\n \n40 \n \nIf a good team with veterans willing to help him selects Arroyo, his game could grow fast enough that he refines his route game and \nbecomes an every-down option. This is less likely because there is some work ahead for him \n \nEvery route Arroyo runs is at the same pace and his breaks lack precision. Pacing and precision are the hallmarks of productive route \nrunning in the NFL. Arroyo is used to leading with his size and speed, but subtlety and precision are the difference makers for top \npros, especially in the underneath passing game.  \n \nOpposing defenders in zone are quicker to anticipate routes and cut off or undercut breaks better. Routes that don’t bait man-to-man \ndefenders into false steps or turns won’t be as effective.  \n \nThese are areas within Arroyo’s ability capabilities to address, and he could make quick and early gains. It will be something to note \nin training camp and preseason games. Here’s what to look for \n \n• \nIs there patience and suddenness with his release footwork off the line? \n• \nWhen he breaks inside or outside, are the first 2-3 steps keeping his turn at 90 degrees?  \n• \nDo his stems – the route before the break – vary in pace to set up the defender before the break? \n \nRight now, the answer to these questions is mostly, “no.” If the answers in August to these questions are mostly, “yes.” Arroyo could \nsurprise.   \n \nOverall, Arroyo is a skilled pass-catcher who makes successful athletic adjustments to targets that the NFL expects from an NFL tight \nend who can win at the boundary or routes where he’s thrown open. For Arroyo to fulfill his promise, he must address specific target \nlocations where he hasn’t formulated a plan of attack with uniform hand position.  \n \nThere are instances in games where it’s clear that Arroyo lacks an ingrained reaction to how he should place his hands for a sound \nattack of the football. These are the awkward locations against the grain of the route that catch him by surprise.  \n \nIf Arroyo spends time breaking down where his attack loses uniformity and then drills the correct uniformity for each area with \ndedicated daily work, Arroyo could ingrain these reactions into his game to the point that he becomes a top pass-catcher.  \n \nAfter the catch, Arroyo’s speed and acceleration make him a weapon, but he has the size and agility to run through contact in the \nsecondary and bounce glancing shots. With a runway, he can run over defensive backs, too.  \n \nAt this point of his career, Arroyo’s best fit as a blocker will be double-teaming the backside of a play and as a stalk blocker from a \ndetached alignment. If he earns one-on-one situations at the line of scrimmage, smaller linebackers and defensive backs will be in \nhis wheelhouse.  \nArroyo has quick hands and he’s combative. He understands aiming points for different blocks and he can keep his hands tight. He \nshould grow into a competent blocker who can do more than what I’m projecting for him immediately. This will depend on how much \nstrength and size he can develop.  \nLong-term, there are more paths for Arroyo to develop into a productive player than Fannin. However, in the development-starved \nNFL where players are far more disposable, Fannin’s game has the slightest edge.  \n \nBoth Fannin and Arroyo have additional value to mine from their games, Fannin’s a better overall receiver. Arroyo’s speed makes \nhim a deep threat, but most tight ends do their work within 25 yards of the line of scrimmage, so route running is vital. This is where \nArroyo has more weaknesses to address than Fannin.  \n \nArroyo is a better blocker than Fannin and has the short-term upside to develop into a more versatile option because of his skills at \nthe line of scrimmage. However, the short-term role Arroyo will have as a blocker will likely be similar to whatever is realistically \nexpected of Fannin. It means the real difference will come down to the receiving game early on and what’s expect of Arroyo long-\nterm in his new system.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? His work ethic, according to coaches after they saw the before and after versions of his work \ncoinciding with an early-career ACL tear. \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Arroyo overextends as a blocker and either misses blocks or defenders dispense with him early.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? Long-term, Arroyo is one of the most scheme versatile options in this tight end class. Ideally, he’d \ndo his best work in a spread offense that features him in various spots and roles around the formation that can leverage him as a \nrunner, pass catcher, and eventually, a blocker.  \n\n \n41 \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Travis Kelce is the aspirational top-end for Arroyo that he’ll likely never reach. A healthier version of \nTodd Heap seems more realistic. Arroyo could match or eclipse Heap’s peak seasons of 70-75 targets, 850 yards, and 7 score.  \nA baseline of 55-65 catches, and 600-700 yards with 4-6 scores also gives him a shot at low-end starter value in fantasy formats. \nThat’s a realistic expectation early on for Arroyo once he clearly establishes himself as a starter.  \nWhat is his floor scenario? Arroyo leans too much on his athletic ability, doesn’t do the added work necessary to grow the \nsubtleties of his game, and he’s no longer considered a worthwhile starter by the end of his rookie contract.  \nPhysical: When blocking a defensive end on the backside of a run, Arroyo earns a square stance, keeps his hands tight, and \nuppercuts to the chest while rolling through his hips. He does this well and does it consistently in this scenario. If he can apply this \ndetail and physicality to other blocks, he’ll be starting in the league.  \nTechnical: Arroyo executes speed turns quickly, but they lack the precision of flat drive and line steps on a consistent basis. I’ve \nseen one route in four games with a flat speed turn on an intermediate route where both the drive and line steps were efficient.  \nConceptual: Pre-snap, Arroyo must be more aware of the defenders who might pressure him. He may begin the play with a double-\nteam, but he must pay more attention to the potential of a delayed blitz or green dog from the linebacker.  \nIntuitive: Route running for Arroyo is more mechanical at this point than art and craft and he must make that transition. \nBuild: All, long, wiry strong, and quick twitch. A young Jared Cook or Luke Willson.  \nReleases: Arroyo has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee.  \nArroyo has wasted movement with his initial release. He takes a step forward with his front foot rather than rolling off it. He rocks off \nhis back foot rather than sinking into his stance and moving forward.  \nOnce in three games charted, I saw Arroyo sink into his stance release with no wasted motion.  \nArroyo counters a defender’s hands with a wipe. He uses a stick to set up breaks to the inside against off-coverage.  \nHe has a quick double up and counters with the wipe. He uses a two-quick at the line to get outside. He attacks with a lean-in to set \nup a wipe to get inside.  \nArroyo has an effective feet-switch with a swim counter to work inside. Against off-coverage with at least a seven-yard cushion, \nArroyo uses a hip shift. Arroyo also uses a swat-swim after diving his stem inside to attack inside leverage so he can break outside.  \nHe reduces his shoulder from the reach of defenders when releasing from a three-point stance. He combines the shoulder reduction \nwith a shed for a blade release.  \nSeparation: Arroyo can beat an off-coverage linebacker up the boundary. He can beat safeties across or up the field and stack \nthem.  \nRoute Stems: Stems are run at a high tempo but everything is the same tempo. There’s no artistry with the route.  \nHe dives inside to attack leverage to the inside and widens to attack outside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: With a corner route, Arroyo sells the inset near the top of his stem against the off-coverage safety. Arroyo uses a \nstairstep against zone coverage against a high safety, but the movements are sometimes more mechanical than artistic. He has \ndemonstrates that he can run better stairsteps with expert use of pacing to draw the defender into the idea of what the route is.  \nRoute Breaks: When Arroyo’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he works to the next potential spot where he can break open. \nArroyo executes speed turns quickly, but they lack the precision of flat drive and line steps on a consistent basis. I’ve seen one route \nin four games with a flat speed turn on an intermediate route where both the drive and line steps were efficient.  \nHe drifts out of breaks and too often, there’s no deceleration at the top of the stem. There are routes where he has a flat line step \nbut drifts initially from his drive step but only one route in four games where he performed both.  \nArroyo has effective weight drop into whip routes and two-step breaks angling inside. He has quick feet with his three-step break, \nbut no weight drop. He also has a drop and pop break that’s quick but lacks the weight drop that will help him earn separation \nagainst man-to-man coverage.  \n\n \n42 \nZone Routes: When working the vertical zones or breaking across intermediate zones, Arroyo doesn’t show his eyes until he has \nearned enough distance from the buzz/rollover defender.   \nHe identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and finds the open space. However, he must settle into the space without \ndrifting.  \nRoute Boundary: Arroyo identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and turns back to the quarterback. However, he \nmust settle into the open area without drifting 2-3 steps after his turn. He’s wasting space and not giving his quarterback a clear \ntarget.  \nPass Tracking: Arroyo tracks targets over his shoulder with underhand attack on shallow and vertical-range routes. He attacks \ntargets at shoulder and helmet height at the earliest window.  \nWhen Arroyo has the potential to deliver a jump up and through to block out a safety on a vertical route, he must do so. High-\npointing with his chest to the safety makes the catch more difficult, if he makes it at all. He has lost targets he could have won if he \nused better positioning at the catch point.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Arroyo tracks the ball behind his break path on vertical routes. He also extends wide of his frame with \ntargets that lead him with his break path. He can extend his arms with underhand attack for targets over his shoulder.  \nArroyo can make sliding catches of low throws, digging out the target with underhand attack. He can high point the ball facing the \nquarterback or working away from the passer and tracking it over his shoulder.   \nArroyo has lapses with his attack where he uses high-low position that’s not only lacking uniformity, but also awkward to execute.  \nPosition: Arroyo can embrace the fall when digging out a low throw.  \nFocus: Arroyo can take a hit to his legs after turning back shoulder to earn the target on a seam route.  \nTransitions: He catches and pierces, and he obeys the path of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Arroyo can get his knees and feet high enough to work over low shots or hurdle his own fallen lineman. He alters \nstride length to set up blocks.  \nHe can transition downhill at the far-side edge with a long perimeter runway with 1-2 steps and/or with curvilinear speed.  \nVision: Arroyo is a patient runner who can alter his stride length or press inside/outside to set up a blocker before hitting the crease \ndecisively. He doesn’t take unnecessary risks and he works within the design of the play.  \nPower: Arroyo drops his pads into oncoming defenders and works through the contact. He wards off reaches with a stiff arm. He can \nrun through wraps to the lower body from a linebacker.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Arroyo bounces off direct shots from safeties.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Arroyo is agile enough to balance-touch through contact. He’ll at least keep his feet long enough to \nlunge forward and earn extra yardage while stumbling and leaning downhill.  \nArroyo bounces off glancing shots from cornerbacks.  \nBall Security: Arroyo tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm and high to his chest. He can take some raking at the ball from a \ndefender.  \nBlocking: As a stalk blocker, Arroyo gets within two yards of the assignment with a square and squat stance. When he and the \ndefender close, Arroyo extends his hands for the defender’s chest.  \nPre-snap, Arroyo must be more aware of the defenders who might pressure him. He may begin the play with a double-team, but he \nmust pay more attention to the potential of a delayed blitz or green dog from the linebacker.  \nArroyo not only makes a second effort with the double team, but he also overextends with his effort and loses sight of the linebacker \nuntil after the linebacker earns 2-3 steps Arroyo could have stopped.  \nArroyo routinely misses defenders who could possibility blitz when he helps with a double team and chooses a technique where he \nloses sight of the potential blitzer.  \n\n \n43 \nWhen blocking a defensive end on the backside of a run, Arroyo earns a square stance, keeps his hands tight, and uppercuts to the \nchest while rolling through his hips. He does this well and does it consistently in this scenario. He uses a one-arm technique \neffectively when the defender attempts to redirect and when the defender redirects a third time, Arroyo is in position to move his \nfeet and remain square.  \nHe has lapses where he overextends and the defender uses his hands to throw Arroyo aside.  \nArroyo has the quickness to develop skill with redirecting from a square and squat position, but he runs from one spot to the next \nwhen working laterally at the edge and it’s inefficient and leads to him overrunning his assignments.  \nWhen aligned as a fullback, Arroyo drops his pads into the chest of the defensive end beginning his rush. The pro of this technique is \nthat the hit can be substantial and slow the defender. The con is that Arroyo cannot sustain the contact because his hands and frame \nare out of position to do so.  \nAs a wind-back blocker, Arroyo delivers a standing cut block where he can earn a square position after the initial hit and then use his \nhands to push the defender further downhill. \nWith Most Dangerous Man assignments from the slot, Arroyo initially works toward the linebacker or slot defender but if he doesn’t \nhave the angle, he works downhill toward the safety.  \nAt this point of his career, Arroyo’s best fit as a blocker will be double-teaming the backside of a play and as a stalk blocker from a \ndetached alignment. If he earns one-on-one situations at the line of scrimmage, smaller linebackers and defensive backs will be his \nwheelhouse.  \nArroyo has quick hands and he’s combative. He understands aiming points for different blocks and he can keep his hands tight. He \nshould grow into a competent blocker who can do more than what I’m projecting for him immediately. This will depend on how much \nstrength and size he can develop.  \nDurability: Torn ACL cost him all but 11 games between 2022 and 2023. He also suffered a knee injury at the Senior Bowl, should \nwork out for his Pro Day. \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Jared Cook was one of those players whose final five seasons where better than his first eight. \nCook was an athletic freak with a 41-inch Vertical Leap and 4.49-second, 40-Yard Dash.  \n \nI don’t think Arroyo is in that tier of athlete, but he’s closer to it than any other option in this class. Fantasy GMs may pounce on \nArroyo’s athletic promise early in drafts and expect early returns. It could make Arroyo a worthwhile buy-low option in a year or two.  \n \nIf you’re drafting Arroyo, consider him a mid-round option after round two unless your format is 1.5 PPR for the position. If he falls \nto the fourth-round, he’s a potential bargain. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nMore awareness of potential blitzers needed  \n• \nLacking uniform attack with awkward target positions \n• \nElijah Arroyo Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n44",
        "analysis": "Elijah Arroyo is a TE prospect with exceptional athleticism (speed being his standout trait), ranking as the TE4 in the RSP rankings.  His size (6'5\", 250 lbs) and speed give him significant upside, drawing comparisons to players like Travis Kelce (high ceiling), Jared Cook (athletic build), and Todd Heap (realistic peak).  He also shares similarities with Luke Willson and Coby Fleener, indicating a potential role as a mismatch weapon.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Athleticism:**  Arroyo possesses elite speed for a tight end, making him a deep threat and a threat after the catch.  His agility and size allow him to run through contact and create yards after reception.\n* **Catch Radius:** He has good hands and can make catches in various positions, including high-pointing the ball and making low catches.\n* **Blocking Potential:** While his blocking needs refinement, he shows flashes of potential, especially in double teams and as a stalk blocker.  His quick hands and combative nature are assets.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Early Production:** His athletic ability could allow him to secure early playing time and production in a role designed to exploit his speed and mismatches.\n* **Scheme Versatility:**  Long-term, he has the potential to become a versatile tight end in a variety of offensive schemes.\n* **Improved Route Running:**  If he refines his route running technique (improving precision, pacing, and awareness), his ceiling is significantly higher.\n\n\n**Weaknesses/Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **Route Running:** His route running is currently inconsistent and lacks precision and subtlety.  He needs to develop more nuanced techniques to consistently create separation against NFL-level defenders.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** While possessing potential, his blocking is inconsistent, often overextending and missing assignments.\n* **Hand Placement:** He lacks uniformity in his hand placement when catching the ball, leading to dropped passes in certain situations.\n* **Awareness:** He needs to improve his awareness of potential blitzers.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparisons span a wide range of outcomes:\n\n* **High Ceiling:** Travis Kelce (extremely athletic, highly productive all-around tight end).  This is considered unrealistic, but highlights his potential.\n* **Realistic Peak:** Todd Heap (a productive tight end known for his receiving skills).\n* **Athletic Build Similarities:** Jared Cook and Luke Willson (both known for their athleticism and receiving abilities).\n* **Similar Role Potential:** Coby Fleener (a role player who could become a productive starter given the right system).\n\n**Overall:**\n\nArroyo is a high-risk, high-reward prospect.  His athleticism is undeniable, giving him the potential to become a valuable NFL tight end. However, significant development is needed in his route running, blocking consistency, and awareness to reach his full potential.

Warren is a skilled pass catcher who wins the ball in contested scenarios, he has moments where he looks like \na tank in the open field, and Penn State’s use of Warren in the backfield adds tantalizing seconds to the television and Internet \nhighlight packages.  \n \nHowever, if you give me a choice of any Penn State tight end currently in the league, I’d take Pat Freiermuth eight days out of \nseven, especially if I can get Freiermuth out of Pittsburgh. Now, If you remove the blocking duties from the equation, I’d have a far \nmore difficult decision that might lean frequently Warren’s direction.  \n \n\n \n45 \nThe reasons I’m not as high on Warren as others: blocking and route running. As a blocker, Warren overextends too much, \ntelegraphing his intentions and allowing defenders to dictate the action. Warren also doesn’t use his hands nearly enough in \nsituations where a blocker in the NFL can’t throw haymakers with his body.  \n \nWarren must learn to punch and keep his pads up so he can dictate the action, use good leverage, and create a chain of sound \ntechniques that lead to the next technique. Stack these skills together and Warren learns to create good processes that lead to more \ngood results than bad.  \n \nRight now, Warren is overwhelming defenders with size and aggression. That works on Saturdays, it’s a lot less consistent on \nSundays.  \n \nWarren’s route running is also a work in progress. There’s no artistry with releases from the line—everything is performed at the \nsame predictable pace.  \n \nWarren doesn’t set up defenders well as a route runner. He must develop more feel for how to maximize his attempts to do so.  \n \nWarren can drop his weight for effective deceleration but he must learn to do it with a greater variety of break types and accelerate \ninto the weight drop so he’s maximizing the potential outcomes with sudden deceleration at the top of stems into breaks.  \n \nWarren also rounds off speed turns too often. This allows opponents to cut off breaks from over the top or undercut breaks from a \ntrail or underneath position.  \n \nNone of these things are difficult for Warren to address case by case. Doing so in the scheme of his transition to the NFL and all that \nit portends could take time. So will taking these individual skills and integrating them into his overall blocking and route game.  \n \nAs is the case for most prospects, it’s not whether Warren lacks the skills to improve, but if he has the smarts, maturity, and wisdom \nto work consistently and intelligently at solving these problems. If he does, Warren can become a good NFL starter—think Tyler Kraft \nwith a better game at the catch point and more to offer after it.   \n \nWarren has viable short-area quickness and smooth acceleration, but he’s not an elite mover at his position by NFL standards. The \nwork from Penn State’s backfield shouldn’t fool you just as their fanbase proclaimed in Pat “Slowkoswki” Freiermuth “Baby Gronk.”  \n \nHe’s a good runner—patient, savvy with his footwork, and an efficient mover—but not as dynamic as advertised. His talents with the \nball will help him break tackles, make defenders miss, and bleed yardage that doesn’t appear there, but it won’t lead to breakaway \nruns that we saw at Penn State.  \n \nIf Warren earns a Tucker Kraft role early on in a scheme, he could gain enough early success that he’ll become a bigger part of the \ngame plan by year’s end or in Year Two. If he’s asked to do more against man-to-man coverage and as a blocker, it might take a \nyear or two more.  \n \nUntil then, Warren’s prowess at the catch point is good enough that another path to early success will be as a red-zone specialist as \na contested-catch athlete, a runner or a trick-play option quarterback inside the five.  \nWarren is a good prospect, but he’s not in the Kittle-Gronkowski tier. He’s also a notch below the Hockenson tier. Think David Njoku, \nJonnu Smith, and Kraft—all capable of delivering 700-900 yards and 6-8 scores as zone specialists who get open field to rumble \nthanks to superior receiving talent stretching the back-end of a secondary.  \nWhere has the player improved? He’s incorporating more route setups but he must continue refining his execution to make them \nviable. \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Speed turns aren’t flat enough and he doesn’t apply weight drop into hard breaks with the full \nrange of routes where he should.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? A team with a creative coordinator that wants to maximize his scheme versatility in the red zone \nwhile he develops the baseline skills of route running and blocking. Think teams that will use two tight end sets and Warren can \nbegin as the second option and leverage his potential as an H-Back.  \nEarly on, his best work will come as a receiver leaking to the flats and working the seams or boundaries against zone coverage.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Warren shores up his lapses, refines his game, and becomes a modern-day Dallas Clark who can \nbecome a wise quarterback’s all-purpose option with 800-1,100-yard potential.  \n\n \n46 \nWhat is his floor scenario? Warren never addresses the fine points of receiving and blocking, and the fad of him running \nconstraint plays that opponents catch up to fades Warren’s viability into Bolivia – as Mike Tyson would say.  \nPhysical: Warren is more earth mover than wrecking ball. He can carry defenders with him.  \nTechnical: Penn State uses Warren as a quarterback and he’s an effective runner and short-yardage thrower. He’s a left-handed \nthrower with pinpoint accuracy with swing passes to the near-side numbers within 10 yards of his release.  \nConceptual: Warren must incorporate good pacing contrasts into his footwork as a route runner and ball carrier. He could \nmanipulate opponents a lot more. \nIntuitive: Warren has a good feel for combining moves as a runner and feel for pursuit in the open field.  \nBuild: Warren has prototypical size for a receiver-first tight end who has some in-line value—provided his short wingspan isn’t too \nproblematic.  \nReleases: When split from the box, Warren has a staggered two-point stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. \nHis hands hang at either side of his front knee.  \nWhen Warren begins his release, he sinks into his stance, leans forward and rolls off his front foot without wasted motion.  \nHe uses a read step against outside leverage to set up breaks inside. He uses a two-quick to attack outside leverage and counters \nwith a wipe or shed. He’ll reduce the shoulder from inside shade leverage midway through his stem. He uses a lean-in at the top of \nhis stem on shallow out-breaking routes.  \nAt the line of scrimmage, Warren has a double up with a swat counter. None of his footwork has a contrast between patience and \nsuddenness. All of it requires greater artistry.  \nPenn State used Warren on delayed releases where he earned position against an edge defender as if he was blocking before \nallowing the defender past him and releasing into the open zone. Warren will also make contact, hold the block for a brief moment \nand release the defender.  \nWarren does this effectively as a backside blocker on sprint-pass packages and front-side edge blocks during the play-action phase \nof the play, setting up a release across the middle.  \nSeparation: Warren has short area quickness and smooth acceleration, but he’s neither a dynamic accelerator nor a breakaway \nspeedster. He has enough acceleration to turn the far-side corner on defensive ends.  \nRoute Stems: Warren will dive his stems against inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: With over routes there’s some attempt to dive inside, straighten out and then break inside on the over, but this \neffort to stair-step a route isn’t thorough enough for a defender to buy. He must straighten out his stem for a longer period and run \nat the defender longer before the break.  \nWarren has an inset at the top of his stems up the seam against off-coverage. He can do more with his upper body to sell the inside.  \nWarren is effective varying the pacing of his stems on shallow routes where he’s aligned as the inside man in a trips look and the \noutside two receivers are running off the secondary for Warren.  \nRoute Breaks: Warren gets his head around to the quarterback as he begins his break. He has a flat drive step with intermediate \nbreaks to the outside. His line step is rounded.  \nWarren presents a friendly target to the ball and runs out his breaks.  \nHis pop and drop breaks need more pop and more drop so he can deliver sudden deceleration and a sudden turn. Warren can drop \nhis weight into whip routes and he’s smooth with his exit from the weight drop in the opposite direction.  \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, he continues to work to an open area.  \nZone Routes: Warren identifies the second-level of the defense, works to depth, and tempos his break between the zone. He’ll also \nthrottle down to the open spot.  \nRoute Boundary: Warren is aware of the boundary and drags his feet to remain in bounds or drops to his knees in tight coverage.  \n\n \n47 \nPass Tracking: Warren extends for the ball over his head without leaving his feet. He tracks the ball over his shoulder with \noverhand position.  \nWarren can also track the ball over his shoulder and behind the back of the defender at his chest.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Warren uses overhand position at the numbers, catching the ball tight to his chest while taking hard contact \nfrom multiple defenders. He can extend his arms from his frame on short out-breaking routes arriving at the numbers.  \nWarren can high point and retract the ball quickly. He extends his arms to an early point away from his frame to catch targets.  \nHe has lapses with clap-attacking targets with underhand position when he should be attacking with overhand position. He also has \nlapses with clap-attacks when high pointing.  \nPosition: Warren can jump and extend his arms over the coverage’s shoulders to catch the target at the defender’s back and pull \nthe ball away (pull back) before hitting the ground. He must work on embracing the fall with targets he extends for when parallel \nwith the ground.   \nFocus: Warren takes hard contact to his chest and back while catching targets on the numbers. He’s comfortable earning targets \nwith defenders tight to his back. He can win high points between defenders – high and low – and execute pull-backs.   \nTransitions: Warren will catch and pierce as a runner. He obeys the path of the ball to determine the direction of his transition.  \nElusiveness: Warren has enough quickness to sidestep a cornerback or linebacker playing over the top of him. He can decelerate \nwith two quick steps to cut inside pursuit over the top of him in close quarters. He can also layer a spin off it.  \nWarren executes a nice double up to press inside traffic and bounce toward his lead blocker’s leverage.  \nVision: Warren finds cutback lanes and gets downhill once he accesses them. As a runner between the tackles. Warren has the \npatience to set up pullers on Counter as well as blockers downfield leading a convoy along the boundary. He can open his hips with \nthe point of the front toe to the boundary.  \nIn the open field, Warren runs to open space and veers away from pursuit.  \nPower: As a short-yardage runner, Warren works between the tackles with low pad level and keeps his feet moving through contact. \nHe pulls through reaches from defensive linemen in the open field. \nWarren has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He’ll pull through multiple reaches and bounce off a hit during a \nrun. Or, he’ll pull through a reach and a wrap.  \nWarren can keep his feet through high wraps and push forward against multiple tacklers.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Warren wins collisions with linebackers and safeties thanks to his low pad level when he meets them with \na downhill runway.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Warren bounces off indirect contact to his chest from safeties and defensive linemen in backside pursuit.  \nBall Security: Warren tucks the ball high to his chest. His elbow is loose from his side. His default arm for carrying the ball is his left \nand that includes touches where he’s outside the right hash. Warren will tuck the ball to his right arm after defaulting it to his left but \nit’s a secondary act and it should be a primary act.  \nWarren wraps both arms around the ball when running through heavy traffic.  \nBlocking: Warren can deliver a hard strike from the wing as a backside blocker. He closes the gap and delivers his hands with an \nuppercut position without the actual uppercut motion/strike.  \nHe can improve his position into the backside edge defenders so he’s walling them off from pursuing down the line. The same is true \nwith his cut blocks of edge defenders. He gets across the frame of the opponent but he doesn’t shoot through the frame of the \ndefender. He tries to roll through the defender after he has already hit the ground.  \nWhen his cut blocks are dives for the inside leg between the tackles, he can strike through the frame of the opponent, but he times \nthe effort too early and he’s not high enough with the cut.  \nWarren is mobile enough as a lead blocker to press one crease and bounce around guard or tackle to the next crease. He \noverextends as a lead blocker with the hope of delivering a hit on a force defender and continue downhill, but his overextension tips \noff the defender and he can miss the block and the defender can earn the tackle.  \n\n \n48 \nWhen Warren isn’t overextending, he’s leading with a forearm and walling off with his back rather than striking with both hands and \nearning position to control the defender face-up.  \nAt the line of scrimmage as a front-side blocker, Warren overextends into defensive ends, but he has the strength to anchor his feet \nand use a one-arm technique to stand up the edge defender long enough to get help from the tackle on a double team. He can work \nto the second level and hook a linebacker long enough to turn the defender on a quick-hitting run.  \nHe overextends against edge defenders as a cut blocker and it leads to him telegraphing his blocks. Defenders can avoid much of the \ncontact when this happens.  \nWarren can handle edge defenders one-on-one as a backside blocker. He bends his hips, maintains a wide stance, and moves his \nfeet. The overextension can place him at an early disadvantage that he can have difficulty overcoming.  \nWhen a defender works away from the block, Warren’s position is tight enough to move his feet and send the defender past his line \nof pursuit.  \nWarren can miss a corner blitz when part of the backside edge protection and he’s not quick enough to slide from a downhill \nalignment to the edge. Warren will also miss safety blitzes from inside the tackle as a lead blocker to that side. He has quick enough \nfeet as the backside blocker to fan outside and redirect inside against some box defenders.  \nWarren is effective as a stalk blocker who can accelerate into the opponent, overwhelm defensive backs with his size and enough \nhand position to lock on and run his feet to turn the defender. He can shield block and double-team at the line of scrimmage. \nHowever, Warren’s aggression can get the better of him as a stalk blocker. He can over-pursue when he should get within two yards \nand let the defender meet him halfway.  \nHe can handle front-side linebackers and some backside edge defenders if he earns the initial contact. If a defender meets Warren’s \npunch, they can dictate terms and win the interaction early.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If “Big Draft” is in on Warren as the top prospect, he’s likely to get overrated in early fantasy \ndrafts before the NFL’s draft and in Yahoo! and ESPN leagues where there are a lot more casual players.  \n \nLike Fannin, Warren is a safer investment post-draft.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPass tracking and pad level \n• \nAcrobatic catch vs. tight coverage \n• \nEmbracing the fall is lacking \n• \nPartial inset – intermediate route running needs work \n• \nHigh-point between DBs, pullback, and boundary awareness \n• \nLacking optimal technique as a lead blocker \n• \nTyler Warren 2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n49",
        "analysis": "Tyler Warren is a TE prospect with a high ceiling but significant areas needing improvement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Catch Point Skills:**  Warren excels at winning contested catches, showcasing impressive high-pointing ability, body control, and the capacity to pull the ball away from defenders.  He boasts a near-perfect pinpoint catch percentage.\n* **Red Zone Threat:** His size, catching ability, and surprising running skills make him a dangerous weapon inside the 20-yard line.  He could thrive early in his career as a red-zone specialist.\n* **Versatility:** Penn State used him in various roles, including as a runner and even a short-yardage passer, demonstrating adaptability.\n* **Physicality:** Warren possesses the size (6'5\", 256 lbs) and strength to overpower defenders at the college level.  He can run through tackles and make defenders miss.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:** His route running is currently inconsistent, lacking artistry and precise execution.  Developing better breaks, stems, and releases would unlock a much higher level of production.\n* **Blocking Technique Refinement:**  Warren's blocking needs significant improvement. He overextends, telegraphing his intentions and failing to utilize proper hand placement and leverage.  Consistent, fundamental improvement here is crucial for NFL success.\n* **Maximizing Athleticism:** While possessing viable short-area quickness and acceleration, he's not an elite mover.  Further refinement of his movement skills could significantly enhance his overall game.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares Warren to a spectrum of players:\n\n* **High Ceiling:** Dallas Clark (all-around talent) – represents his potential if he significantly improves his weaknesses.\n* **Likely Outcome:** Tucker Kraft –  a more realistic comparison, reflecting his strengths in receiving and red zone play, but also highlighting the need for development in blocking and route running.\n* **Similar Skill Sets:**  David Njoku, Jonnu Smith –  players who have thrived in specific roles using their receiving talents, but have limitations in blocking.\n\nThe report suggests he's not at the elite level of players like Travis Kelce or Rob Gronkowski, but has the potential to be a solid starter in the NFL, akin to a Kraft or even a Clark, if he makes the necessary improvements.  His floor is significantly lower, potentially rendering him ineffective if he doesn't address his technical flaws.\n"

He’s \ngood at a lot of things, but nothing about him as an athlete, blocker, route runner, receiver, or ball carrier makes him a mismatch \nagainst defenses.  \n \nHelm’s dimensions and athletic ability places him in a similar archetype as Harrison Bryant, a capable H-Back in two-tight end sets \nwho lacks the explosion and size to present mismatches against man-to-man coverage. By the way, this assessment of Helm’s \nathletic ability is based on his film and not Combine measurements Helm earned after badly spraining his ankle while committing a \nfalse start in his first attempt of the 40-Yard Dash.  \n \n\n \n50 \nHelm has enough acceleration and short-area quickness to earn separation with man-to-man routes and challenge zone defenders up \nthe seams. He lacks the explosion to pull away from the secondary—he may flip the field but more times than not, Helm doesn’t \nbreakaway to the end zone.  \n \nHelm must develop a wider variety of release techniques from the line of scrimmage and learn to perform them with greater artistry. \nOtherwise, he’s not setting up his moves to leverage his quickness and acceleration.  \n \nSimilarly, Helm has learned some techniques with stems to manipulate defenders facing him in zone coverage. However, his lack of \nartistry with pacing makes the techniques too predictable.  \n \nOnce Helm develops greater master with the front half of routes it will only enhance the quality of his breaks. Helm can drop his \nweight into hard breaks and deliver flat speed turns.  \n \nHelm attacks the ball effectively at a variety of angles and uses the appropriate attack. There are lapses with judgment and \ntechnique were Helm clap-attacks targets and leaves his feet for targets where jumping is unnecessary. Even so, Helm has the \ncatch-point toughness to produce in the NFL.    \n \nAfter the catch, Helm is a decisive, straight-line runner who attacks downhill but has a good feel for pursuit angles over the top and \nhow to avoid that opponent. He doesn’t take unnecessary risks as a decision-maker, but he can set up defenders into back pursuit \nangles and exploit them.  \nHe has just enough agility and footwork to sidestep blocks and balance and power to bounce off glancing shots. Helm is a chain \nmover with the ball in his hands.  \n \nOverall, Helm lacks the size and technique to win as a blocker against NFL-sized athletes along the defensive front and at strong side \nlinebacker. He also lacks the acceleration to work laterally against smaller and more athletic NFL athletes as a perimeter blocker.  \nHis position and punch are lacking. It leads to Helm overextending and losing position before he ever has a chance to gain it.  \nPlace Helm in a rotation with 2-3 tight ends, and there’s enough reliability and versatility for him to perform what’s asked. Unless he \nhas a late growth spurt and adds quick-twitch muscle, Helm is bumping his head against his game’s ceiling more than anyone ranked \nahead of him and potentially the 5-7 options behind him.  \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Helm has occasional lapses where he clap-traps targets to his chest and fights the ball. \nWhat is the best scheme fit? As a second tight end who learns to lead block and leak into the shallow zone. \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Helm makes significant gains as an athlete and/or technician to become a reliable middle-of-the-field \npresence in a passing game where he has undeniable rapport with a quarterback.   \nWhat is his floor scenario? An unutilized reserve who must play special teams to maintain an active roster spot. \nPhysical: Helm takes contact to earn targets.  \nTechnical: He’s a hugger more than a puncher against edge pressure and this allows defenders quicker position around the corner. \nIt also gives defenders an easier opportunity to redirect without adequate resistance.  \nConceptual: He has occasional lapses where he doesn’t obey the ball and makes a poor decision with where to transition downhill \nafter the catch.  \nIntuitive: He’s a decisive, straight-line runner who attacks downhill but has a good feel for pursuit angles over the top and how to \navoid that opponent.  \nBuild: Undersized for a move tight end who lacks game-changing technical and/or athletic skills to compensate. \nReleases: From a three-point stance, Helm uses a read step off the line to set up a Most Dangerous Man assignment downhill to the \nsafety. He’ll dive his stem and reduce the shoulder from the shallow defender. Helm can also combine a read step with a shoulder \nreduction to earn separation from coverage during the stem of an over route. His shed counter is also effective.  \nWhen used as a detached receiver, Helm has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms rest \nwith his hands uncrossed at the top of his front knee.  \nWhen Helm begins his release, he rocks off his back foot and takes an unnecessary step with his front foot. He must cut out the \nwasted motion with his feet.  \n\n \n51 \nHe has an effective swat-swim against off-coverage.  \nSeparation: Helm can work up the intermediate seam and beat linebackers. He’s not going to separate from deep safeties or \ncorners.  \nRoute Stems: Helm attacks the inside leverage of zone coverage with a dive of the stem. He widens outside leverage with his \nstems.  \nRoute Setups: Helm dips his head inside along with a stick to deliver an inset against the safety over the top. The pacing variation \nis lacking. He could do more to set up the move.  \nRoute Breaks: When running speed out at half speed, his drive and line steps are flat. He gets his head around early and presents a \nfriendly target.  \nHelm uses a long break step into a drop and pop break with effective weight drop.  \nWhen Helm’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he continues working to find an open area.  \nZone Routes: Helm identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks for his quarterback. He also knows \nwhere to settle into the open area when not working across the field.  \nRoute Boundary: He can toe-tap the endline as he backs his way toward it after high-pointing a target.  \nPass Tracking: Helm leaves his feet unnecessarily for short targets at or above his helmet.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Helm can high point the ball—even if leaving his feet was potentially unnecessary. He extends to the earliest \npoint with underhand attack for targets at his waist. He turns behind his break path to catch targets at his back hip.  \nHelm has occasional lapses where he clap-traps targets to his chest and fights the ball. Helm can extend one arm wide of his frame \nand snare the ball on screens.  \nPosition: Helm can embrace the fall after high pointing against coverage. He has an effective pull-back through a high point with a \ndefender in his chest.  \nFocus: Helm can earn the high point with a defender’s hand swatting at the ball between his hands as he makes the catch. He can \nalso take a hit to his chest while landing from a high point across the middle.  \nTransitions: Helm catches and pierces downhill. He obeys the ball and adjusts his frame to catch the target while heading downhill. \nHe has occasional lapses where he doesn’t obey the ball and makes a poor decision with where to transition.  \nElusiveness: Helm can side step defenders and spin through contact. He has a small jump cut in open space. He alters his stride \nlength to set up blocks downfield and then hits the lane decisively.  \nHe can layer a two-quick with a hurdle at the boundary and land on his feet over the cornerback shooting for his thighs \nVision: Helm can set up defenders in open space with small moves to press an unblocked opponent and bounce or cut back. Helm \ndoesn’t take any unnecessary risks as a decision-maker that will cost him yardage.  \nOverall, he’s a decisive, straight-line runner who attacks downhill but has a good feel for pursuit angles over the top and how to \navoid that opponent.  \nPower: Helm wards off reaches to his frame with his stiff arm, and he can pull through reaches. He keeps his feet moving through \nwraps to his frame until thrown off balance.  \nHelm initiates contact downhill and leads with his pads and forearm.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Helm bounces off direct shots to his legs from cornerbacks, forcing them to wrap up.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Helm bounces off hits to his side from cornerbacks and linebackers and continues forward.  \nBall Security: Helm carries the ball under his boundary-side arm and close to his chest. The elbow is loose from his side and he has \nlost control of the ball when a defender makes precise contact with the ball inside Helm’s elbow. \nBlocking: Helm has good timing, height, and position to work across and shoot through the edge defender on a wind-back cut block.  \n\n \n52 \nAs a pass protector, Helm shuffles his feet well from a square and squat position so he can remain in position with an assignment. \nHe’s a hugger more than a puncher against edge pressure and this allows defenders quicker position around the corner. It also gives \ndefenders an easier opportunity to redirect without adequate resistance.  \nHelm identifies corner blitzes and can drive the defender outside the pocket after fanning outside to attack the opponent.  \nWith cut-off blocks, Helms hands can be tighter. His overall position isn’t tight enough to the defender and it forces him to lean \nforward and overextend with his head into the effort.  \nWith Most Dangerous Man assignments, Helm approaches safeties as if he’s running an over route and then turns and walls off the \ndefender from the ball carrier. \nHelm has quick feet to adjust with linebackers and safeties on Most Dangerous Man assignments.  \nWhen Helm punches, he jabs both arms rather than uppercuts. This limits his potential to punch with meaningful power. Combined \nwith his head dropping into collisions, and Helm’s potential as an inline blocker is limited until he corrects these issues.  \nAs a puller, Helm can get his hands tight and deliver an uppercut, but he’s too far away to roll through the hips  when he lands the \npunch. He can get tight to a defender and take the air out of the interaction as well as take tine inside shoulder of the defender to \npush the defender outside.  \nOverall, Helm lacks the size and technique to win against NFL-sized athletes along the defensive front and at strong side linebacker. \nHe also lacks the acceleration to work laterally against smaller and more athletic NFL athletes as a perimeter blocker.  \nDurability: No significant injuries. \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Unless you’re in a 1.5 PPR league for tight ends and have a large roster, Helm is one of those \noptions who might prove good enough to deliver fantasy value off the waiver wire whenever injuries strike, but won’t hang onto an \nNFL starting role long-term. He has nearly maximized his potential, which means he’ll need a special relationship with an excellent \nquarterback to earn a starting role with weekly value. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nGunnar Helm Every 2024 Target & Touch \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n53",
        "analysis": "Gunnar Helm is a TE prospect with a projected NFL role as a rotational player, unlikely to become a long-term starter.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Reliable hands:**  Helm boasts excellent catch-point skills, displaying a high catch percentage and rarely dropping passes, even in tight coverage.  He effectively attacks the ball at various angles.\n* **After-the-catch ability:** He's a decisive, downhill runner who shows good vision and awareness of pursuit angles, making him a chain-mover.  He possesses enough agility and power to elude tacklers.\n* **Route running (potential):** He demonstrates short-area quickness to create separation on man-to-man routes, particularly against linebackers.  He has a good understanding of route concepts and identifying open zones.\n* **Physicality:**  He's willing to take contact to secure targets and shows some strength in breaking tackles.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved route running technique:** While possessing the speed and quickness for success, his technique needs refinement. Developing more diverse release techniques and improved pacing would significantly enhance his separation ability.\n* **Blocking improvement:** His blocking needs significant work.  He's undersized and lacks the necessary punch and technique to consistently compete against NFL-level defenders.  Improving his hand placement and leverage would make him a more valuable contributor.\n* **Athleticism:** While his ankle injury hampered his Combine performance, further development in overall athleticism, especially explosion, could boost his ceiling.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Undersized:** He lacks the size to consistently win one-on-one matchups against NFL-caliber defenders, both as a receiver and blocker.\n* **Blocking technique:**  His blocking is his biggest weakness, currently insufficient for a regular role.\n* **Lack of elite athleticism:** He lacks the breakaway speed and agility to consistently win against top-tier NFL defensive backs.\n* **Consistency:** Occasional lapses in technique, like \"clap-trapping\" the ball, need to be eliminated.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** Harrison Bryant and Jake Butt are cited as comparable players.  Both are/were solid receiving tight ends who played a role in their offenses but weren’t dominant forces.  The comparison highlights Helm's potential as a valuable contributor but not a star.  His lack of elite athleticism and blocking skills prevents him from reaching the level of a top-tier NFL tight end.\n"

The complicating factor is \nwhether they have enough qualities from one of the two archetypes at the position or they are too much of a bad mix of the two to \ndeliver in the NFL.  \n \n\n \n54 \nI’ll share more about his with Gavin Bartholomew and Luke Lachey. Fidone appears to be the exception who could adjust his body to \nbecome a move tight end or an inline tight end whereas Bartholomew and Lachey could be in an athletic limbo that won’t work as \nwell in the NFL as it does in college football.  \n \nFidone, a former four-star recruit who suffered two ACL injuries early in his college career, leads the trio by a narrow margin and has \nthe most compelling upside. The common refrain colleagues share about Fidone is that his low quality of quarterbacking makes his \nevaluation more difficult.  \n \nIf the quarterback couldn’t get the ball within a mile of Fidone, that would prove true. At the same time, a less than stellar passer \nthrows a lot of targets that require the receiver to compensate for throws that aren’t pinpoint accurate.  \n \nFidone’s tape is filled with him catching targets at every angle and window. Maybe it’s an argument in favor of this situation some \nscouts lament.  \n \nFidone also positions his body well to earn the ball away from tight coverage and when contact is imminent, Fidone wins those \ntargets, too.  \n \nWhat impressed me more about Fidone than his pass-catching was his routes. He may not have a packed toolbox of tools for selling \na stem to set up a break but he executes the handful of ways he knows at a high level and they are interchangeable with a variety of \nroutes. The setups have the right amount of emphasis to sell the movement. \n \nFidone’s breaks are also clean and crisp. He can drop his weight, make flat turns, and there’s snap to his turns. This is something \nyou don’t usually see with NFL prospects who run routes until their third or fourth year in the league, if ever.  \n \nAlthough Fidone has twice dealt with a torn ACL, he has sharp lateral cuts, efficient footwork, and NFL starter-level control to \ntransition downhill from a perimeter path within two steps. Fidone applies these tools well. He’s patient, decisive, and creative in \ntraffic.  \n \nFidone has success with box defenders in the running game as a blocker. He can stand-up defensive linemen and keep them from \nshedding early in the play. As a lead blocker on the edge, Fidone can turn his hips while locked onto a defensive back and turn the \ndefender’s back to the boundary and then push the defender out of the play \nWhen Fidone makes errors, they are usually conceptual miscues instead of some lack of technique. The one exception is the \noccasional desire to blow up opponents with his pads instead of hitting and controlling with his hands.  \n \nIf Fidone is past his injuries, he could emerge as an NFL starter by the end of his rookie contract. The biggest question I have about \nFidone is what kind of tight end will he be?  \n \nFidone’s weight at the NFL Combine was 243 pounds. His listed weight at Nebraska was 255 pounds. While it’s commonplace for \ncollege teams to fudge height and weight for their programs, there’s reason to believe Fidone lost weight to enhance his performance \nat the Combine.  \n \nThe logical assumption is that Fidone won’t play at 243 pounds because he’s one of the better run blockers in this class, and the 12-\n15 pounds of muscle at 255-260 pounds is valuable. If he plays at this weight, which is likely the weight he was on Saturdays, \nthere’s concern that he won’t be as explosive as he was in Indianapolis.  \n \nFidone had a starter grade in the 20-Shuttle (4.26), a borderline elite grade in the 3-Cone (7.01) and a borderline starter grade in \nthe 40-Yard Dash (4.7). When watching his film, his on-field athletic ability didn’t appear out of step with his workouts. I recalled \nbeing surprised by his acceleration and quickness before seeing his workout results.  \n \nEven so, if Fidone cheated to the test maybe the added weight will impact his athletic ability a small amount. It might limit him in \nthe intermediate and vertical ranges as a route runner. At the same time, perhaps Fidone cut the weight because he knew he’d be \nmore explosive and his knees might feel better without that weight.  \n \nConsidering the work I’ve seen from him as a receiver and route runner, there is a viable path for Fidone to succeed as an H-Back \nwho can block better than the average receiving tight end in the 240-pound range. In this respect, Fidone reminds me a bit of what \nmy friend, Ryan Riddle, told me about Keenan Allen.  \n \nRiddle, the single-season sack record holder for the Cal Bears, told me years ago that Allen was a fascinating prospect because he \ncould be two vastly different types of receivers. Riddle said Allen had the body to bulk up and deliver as a boundary-winning outside \nreceiver, but also the ability to slim down and be as sudden as a deer who could run all day.  \n \n\n \n55 \nFidone may never have the tight end equivalent of Allen’s receiving career, but there’s skill and versatility with his game that his \ninjuries, program, and the buzz of other talents in this rich class have covered up.  \n \nWhere has the player improved? Fidone has become more experienced with combo blocks, and he has developed a good feel for \nspotting a second-level player who poses the biggest threat to the play’s development and forgoing the assignment on paper that \nisn’t as important to the reality of the situation.  \nReleases: Fidone has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront leg. When he begins his release, Fidone sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot with no wasted motion.  \nFidone uses a read step against off-coverage to attack outside leverage. He also uses a two-quick against inside leverage. Fidone \npairs a hesitation with a double up off the line.  \nHe counters with a shed that’s violent but would be better off using a double swat against the position of the coverage. When the \nshed doesn’t work, Fidone is patient enough to wait until the top of the stem and use a wipe to set up his break.  \nFidone has a swat and wipe combination as well as a swat-swim countering a two-quick. He also reduces the shoulder from a three-\npoint stance.  \nHe combines a double-up and a two-quick to set up outside leverage. Neither move had the artistry to bait an opponent. He has a \nhip shift against off-coverage but it needs more artistry with pacing to work well.  \nFidone sells the vertical potential of his routes with pads of his knees and attacks the leverage of an off-coverage defender at full \nspeed.  \nSeparation: He can beat linebackers and threaten some safeties up the seam.  \nRoute Stems: Fidone dives inside against outside leverage. He’ll also widen stems against off-coverage to set up inside breaks.  \nRoute Setups: Fidone will sell the inset against tight man-to-man coverage to set up the out-breaking route—he’s adept at using \nthis maneuver. He delivers violent head fakes inside to set up off-coverage at the top of his stem.  \nRoute Breaks: Fidone has a quick speed turn with flat drive and line steps – even with routes in the intermediate range of the field. \nHe also works back to the quarterback.  \nFidone snaps his turns and gets his head around quickly out of the break.  \nZone Routes: Fidone identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He earns snap on the turn \nto present a friendly target quickly to the quarterback.  \nWhen breaking across zones, Fidone tempos his breaks and doesn’t show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender. \nWhen his first break doesn’t earn a target, Fidone will work with the quarterback to create open space.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary. He can toe-tap both feet inbounds with a defender wrapping his back. He can also \nhigh point and drag his feet.  \nPass Tracking: Fidone tracks the ball over his shoulder with overhand attack on routes breaking outside and away from the \nquarterback.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Fidone can high-point targets when breaking across the zone. He can also dig out low throws near the \nboundary as long as he’s more aware of the boundary.  \nFidone makes catches behind his break path at his back hip with underhand attack. He also extends past the break path with \ncoverage tight.  \nFidone attacks targets arriving at his numbers at the earliest point. He can also make full-extension catches behind his break path \nwith overhand attack. \nFidone extends to his knees with underhand position to earn a target.  \nPosition: Fidone will embrace the fall to avoid landing on a low target he dug out. He has an effective pull-back against trail \ncoverage.  \nFocus: Fidone can extend for targets against tight coverage at his back. He can catch the ball with hard contact to his chest.  \n\n \n56 \nTransitions: Fidone practices effective catch-and-pierce principles. He also obeys the ball—letting the target direct his transition \ndownhill.  \nElusiveness: Fidone can execute a sharp lateral cut to slip inside pursuit from over the top. He only needs two steps to transition \ndownhill on a route break to the short-side numbers.  \nVision: Fidone displays patience, decisiveness, and creativity in traffic. He sets up blocks and he creates space without blockers. \nPower: Fidone pulls through reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Fidone can run through hits to his lower legs from cornerbacks. He stalemates linebackers head-on.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He stalemates linebackers delivering glancing shots.  \nBall Security: Fidone tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm after the catch. The elbow is loose, but he carries the ball high to his \nchest.  \nBlocking: Fidone moves well laterally with a wide stance when he’s stalk blocking.  \nWhen working inline, Fidone closes the gap, earns a wide stance with good bend, and keeps his feet moving after contacting the \ndefender with his hands tight and elbows bent.  \nFidone will work outside-in as a combo blocker or when he spots a bigger immediate threat to the play’s development.  \nAgainst edge defenders, Fidone delivers an uppercut punch and rolls his hips through the contact. He can neutralize edge defenders \nwith his punch, position, and movement of his feet.  \nEdge defenders—including defensive ends—can attempt to shed Fidone to one side or the other and Fidone maintains his center of \ngravity.  \nAs a windback blocker, Fidone executes timely cut blocks. He works across the defender’s frame, earns good height, and shoots \nthrough the opponent.  \nAs a lead blocker/puller, Fidone leads with his shoulder and goes for the big hit rather than a two-handed uppercut punch. This \nmakes him a one-and-one blocker in these scenarios.  \nFidone can shuffle his feet with a wide stance to fan out against edge pressure. He anticipates swim moves and slides with the swim \nto prevent it from working. His hands are tight into the chest of the defender which helps him control the opponent.  \nHe can slide too far outside against a double team and allow the defender to split the double team and reach the pocket, but that’s a \nconceptual matter more than physical or technical. He’s quick enough to get outside as a lead blocker to seal a defensive back \noutside on a perimeter run.  \nWhen attacking the linebacker at the second level, Fidone can work inside-out and turn the linebacker away from the ball carrier’s \npath. If the defender tries to redirect, Fidone’s tight position into the linebacker’s body can lead to pancakes.  \nFidone has success with box defenders in the running game as a blocker. He can stand-up defensive linemen and keep them from \nshedding early in the play. As a lead blocker on the edge, Fidone can turn his hips while locked onto a defensive back and turn the \ndefender’s back to the boundary and then push the defender out of the play \nHe has missed edge pressure that was indicated pre-snap, but it’s hard to tell whether he was assigned elsewhere or didn’t see it. \nDurability: ACL injury before the 2021 season as a freshman that forced him to redshirt. He missed 2022 recovering another ACL \ninjury.   \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you miss out on the big names in this class because you focused on other positions, Fidone could \nbe that bargain worth a later investment. He’ll likely be a favorite sleeper among my peers after his workouts, but the tape also \nsupports it.  \n \nIn fact, if Fidone plays at 255-260 pounds and doesn’t lose his athletic explosion, Fidone’s Depth of Talent Score could be 3 points \nhigher, which would make him TE3 on my board. Even if you compensate for some loss of speed and quickness with the weight gain, \nFidone’s score would be 1.6 points higher, which would make him TE6 with a score nearly identical to TE5, Tyler Warren.  \n \n\n \n57 \nHe might be one of the quiet gems of this class—maybe never a fantasy star, but think of a combination of Zach Ertz, Pat \nFreiermuth, Tucker Kraft, and Hunter Henry – last year’s TE8-TE11 in fantasy leagues. As shown in the Comparison Spectrums at the \ntop of this report, the combinations depend on Fidone’s playing weight.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nRelease, stem, flat speed turn, snaps the turn, works back to the quarterback \n• \nFlat break, extension vs tight coverage, boundary awareness \n• \nQuick and elusive footwork after the catch in traffic \n• \nThomas Fidone Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n58",
        "analysis": "Thomas Fidone II is a tight end prospect with a high ceiling but also some uncertainty surrounding his optimal playing weight and resulting NFL role.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Route Running:**  Fidone possesses surprisingly polished route-running skills for a prospect, showcasing clean breaks, crisp turns, and an understanding of leverage against defenders.  His route running is a significant strength, potentially NFL-ready.\n* **Strong Hands and Catch Radius:** He demonstrates the ability to high-point the ball, make catches in tight coverage, and secure low throws. He's adept at adjusting to poorly thrown balls.\n* **Above-Average Blocking:** Fidone is a capable blocker, particularly in run blocking. He displays good technique, power, and awareness in both inline and perimeter blocking situations.  He excels at sustaining blocks and identifying key blockers.\n* **Athleticism:** Despite two ACL injuries, he possesses impressive athleticism, showing good acceleration, quickness, and agility in both his testing numbers and on-field performance.\n* **Versatility:** Fidone's skillset allows him to potentially excel in multiple roles, from an inline blocker to a move tight end. This versatility makes him a valuable asset.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Weight and Athleticism:**  His ideal playing weight is uncertain.  Playing heavier (255-260 lbs) might enhance his blocking but potentially decrease his athleticism, while a lighter weight (240-250 lbs) could favor his receiving skills.  Finding the right balance is crucial.\n* **Improving Consistency:** While skilled, occasional conceptual errors and a tendency to rely on power over finesse in blocking need refinement.\n* **High-Level Competition:**  The quality of his college quarterback play may have impacted his statistics and overall evaluation. Proving himself against consistently strong NFL talent will be key.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nHis comparison depends heavily on his weight:\n\n* **Version A (255-260 lbs):** Pat Freiermuth (strong blocking, receiving ability), Tucker Kraft (versatile tight end). This suggests a more traditional, well-rounded tight end role.\n* **Version B (240-250 lbs):** Zach Ertz (receiving specialist), Hunter Henry (combination of receiving and blocking). This points to a more receiving-focused tight end role.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nFidone is a high-potential tight end prospect with the potential to be a rotational starter or even a full-time starter depending on his weight and development.  His exceptional route running and blocking skills are his biggest assets.  The NFL team that drafts him will need to determine his optimal weight and maximize his strengths accordingly. His success hinges on managing his weight, refining his consistency, and proving his ability to translate his college success against top-tier NFL competition.\n"

After watching an exhaustive amount of his work as a receiver, Briningstool’s great moments don’t compensate enough for \nhis lapses as a pass-catcher.   \nThis includes targets against contact where there’s little question he should have won the ball. It also includes the most difficult \ntargets where focus and toughness are needed, but Briningstool’s skills fail him.  \n\n \n59 \nBecause of the highs I’ve seen with Briningstool as a pass catcher, I wouldn’t be surprised if he emerges as the best ball-winner in \nthis tight end class. At the same time, there’s enough holding him back that he could fail to emerge and get stuck in his own head \nwhen facing difficult targets.  \nThe baseline skills are good enough for Briningstool to make teams and contribute, but the variance with his pass-catching may \nprove too great for a team to rely on him as anything more than a No. 2 or a playable No. 3 tight end in the rotation.  \nBriningstool is a good ball carrier who can deliver in the open field as well as on screens. This could be a path to a role for \nBriningstool as a playable reserve because he’s a good blocker for his size. Pair him with a larger in-line option in a good running \ngame with an effective screen game – Kevin Stefanski’s original schemes in Minnesota and Cleveland – and Briningstool’s work as a \nblocker will be a good set up for the short passing game with open space ahead.  \nAlthough Briningstool has effective releases against coverage at the line of scrimmage, his route breaks need more work. For now, \nhe’s a bigger asset against zone coverage than man-to-man.  \nWhen you add it up, Briningstool’s size, routes, hands, and ball-carrying skills make him a viable contributor against zone defenses, \nbut an inconsistent option lacking mismatch qualities against man-to-man. If he can develop the man-to-man skills and curtail the \nlapses with his hands against tight coverage, he could surprise.  \nI wouldn’t count on those ifs happening. He’s an intriguing player with a high floor, but a difficult path to his ceiling.  \nWhere has the player improved? His setups as a blocker at the line of scrimmage. His stance is wider, hands are tighter, and \nposition has little air between himself and the opponent.  \nWhere is the player inconsistent? Catching the ball against contact and tight coverage. If he solves this, look out.  \nWhat is the best scheme fit? A Kubiak-inspired variant of the West Coast offense where Briningstool can develop into an H-Back \nwho earns targets with room to run against zone defenses.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Think Garrett Graham’s 49-catch, 545-yard, 5-score peak in 2013 if he doesn’t develop his man-to-\nman game, but he earns a viable role in a Kubiak offense as an injury replacement for a starter.  \nIf he becomes a better man-to-man option, consider Dalton Kincaid’s 73-catch, 673-yard output as a rookie just before Buffalo’s \nRicky-Bobby QB told Kincaid that only one of them could win.    \nWhat is his floor scenario? A career reserve or high-end CFL performer.  \nPhysical: Briningstool attacks with his elbows bent and aims for the defender’s chest. He’ll attack the outside shoulder of the \ndefender if he’s blocking the force player. He has defeated defensive ends one-on-one, turning them inside. He attacks the inside \nshoulder when he can seal a defender outside on a run up the middle. This probably won’t happen with reliable frequency in the NFL, \nbut the effort and techniques are good enough to translate to succeed against some linebackers.   \nTechnical: He’s skilled at winning the ball with jump up and through techniques. Briningstool has an effective pull-back. His timing \nand positioning with the jump up and through is good. He can pull the ball back with a defender’s hand on the ball. He embraces the \nfall effectively. \nConceptual: When executing TE screens, Briningstool settles into the open space but if needed, he’ll slide further into open space, \ntempoing his break while maintaining a friendly position to the quarterback. He’ll work to an open spot when his first break doesn’t \nearn a target. Many receivers self-destruct in traffic when screens don’t work immediately. \nIntuitive: Briningstool has quick reactions to unanticipated pursuit angles. He’s a patient runner who will allow pursuit to overrun its \nangles and then hit an open crease decisively. He doesn’t take unnecessary risks and he can create with or without blockers.  \nBuild: He’s about 10 pounds lighter than the baseline for what teams seek from a receiver-first tight end and he lacks upper echelon \nskills and/or athletic ability that compensates. If he gets his hands right (see above), he might.  \nReleases: Briningstool has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of \nhis front knee.  \nWhen he begins his release, Briningstool sinks a little in his stance and rolls off the front foot without wasted motion.  \nHe counters the hands of a defender with a wipe. From a three-point stance, Briningstool uses a read step outside and counters the \ndefender’s hands with a swim.  \nBriningstool executes the double up with patience and suddenness. He uses a hesitation at the top of his stem on shallow speed turn.  \n\n \n60 \nBriningstool uses a stick to set up in-breaking routes. He counters the defender’s hands with a wipe. \nHe uses a two-quick to set up a break at the top of stem. He also uses a swat-swim combination to counter a defender’s hands off \nthe two-quick.  \nBriningstool has an effective hip shift with a wipe counter against off-coverage. He’ll steal a release in the red zone with a two-quick.  \nSeparation: Briningstool has enough acceleration to beat linebackers up the seam, but only enough long speed to pull a step past \nthe near-side safety.  \nRoute Stems: Briningstool dives inside to attack inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: After diving inside against an off-man defender, Briningstool will take the back of the defender to set up a vertical \nroute. He’ll also dive inside as part of a stairstep of off coverage.  \nBriningstool widens stems out of a three-point stance.  \nRoute Breaks: Briningstool snaps his head around fast on stop routes, but must learn to punch the boundary-side arm and snap the \nturn of his body.  \nBriningstool’s speed turns have a flat drive step, but the line step is rounded and he drifts out of his breaks. This is the case with \nshort and intermediate routes. \nHe has effective weight drop into whip routes. Briningstool has a long break step but could cultivate that weight drop into a drop and \npop break or a three-step break. His drop and pop break needs more precise footwork and the weight drop.  \nHe has some weight drop into his three-step break when he begins it with a long break step. More is needed to optimize the \ndeceleration into the break.  \nZone Routes: Briningstool identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly \nposition to the quarterback.  \nWhen executing TE screens, Briningstool settles into the open space but if needed, he’ll slide further into open space, tempoing his \nbreak while maintaining a friendly position to the quarterback. He’ll work to an open spot when his first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nRoute Boundary: Briningstool is aware of the boundary on out-breaking routes, shortens his stride length, and toe-taps inbounds. \nHe can turn through the catch point near the boundary and get both feet in bounds. He can also drag the knee.  \nPass Tracking: Briningstool tracks the ball over his shoulder and takes contact to his back. He also displays late hands, waiting to \nattack the ball until it is overhead.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Briningstool digs out low throws, sliding toward coverage with underhand position to earn the ball. He \nextends his arms away from his waist with an underhand attack to earn the ball in stride on a vertical route. His high points are \neffective.  \nPosition: Briningstool has an effective pull-back. His timing and positioning with the jump up and through is good. He can pull the \nball back with a defender’s hand on the ball. He embraces the fall effectively.  \nFocus: When Briningstool extends his arms away from his waist with an underhand attack to earn the ball in stride on a vertical \nroute, he has the focus to catch the ball with a safety closing fast and within inches of the catch point. He retracts the ball fast and \nhas a quick spin to avoid the contact—a good pull-back.   \nOverall, Briningstool’s work against contact has too many highs and lows to elevate this area of his game to the opt tier. His highs \ninclude jump up and throughs with a defender tight to his side with a one-handed high-point with a back-handed grab.  \nHis lows include targets where he should make the catch despite the contact and he has as many failures as successes. The most \ndifficult target where focus and toughness are needed are the line where Briningstool’s technique and focus fail him too often. While I \nwouldn’t be surprised if he emerges as the best pass-catcher in this tight end class, there’s enough holding him back to differentiate \nhim from several of his peers.  \nTransitions: Bringingstool catches and pierces downhill efficiently. He obeys the direction of the ball, letting it dictate the path of his \ncatch and pierce.  \n\n \n61 \nElusiveness: Briningstool has a quick and efficient spin to avoid oncoming contact up the seam. He has good stop-start footwork to \nforce defensive linemen to overrun their pursuit angles. He needs only two quick steps to transition downhill from a perimeter \napproach.  \nVision: Briningstool has quick reactions to unanticipated pursuit angles. He’s a patient runner who will allow pursuit to overrun its \nangles and then hit an open crease decisively. He doesn’t take unnecessary risks and he can create with or without blockers.  \nPower: Briningstool finishes with low pad level and can extend through contact. He uses a stiff arm to swat past defender’s \noverrunning their angles after Briningstool decelerated in the open field. He can pull through multiple reaches and pushes to his \nupper body during a run.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Briningstool can drop his pads into a corner’s direct contact and ride over the top, extending 2-3 yards, \nwhich can be the difference between a reception and a touchdown. \nIndirect Contact Balance: Briningstool bounces off glancing shots to his side from safeties and outside linebackers. \nBall Security: Briningstool carries the ball close to his chest. The elbow is loose from his side. He can take contact to the ball-\ncarrying arm. He uses his boundary-side arm to carry the ball.  \nBlocking: When facing an edge defender as a pass protector on a quick game throw, Briningstool slide inside to eliminate that gap \nbetween himself and the tackle before fanning out to take the edge defender’s inside shoulder to push the opponent around the \npocket. Briningstool’s hands are tight and he shuffles his feet well laterally with a wide stance. \nBriningstool attacks with his elbows bent and aims for the defender’s chest. He’ll attack the outside shoulder of the defender if he’s \nblocking the force player. He has defeated defensive ends one-on-one, turning them inside. He attacks the inside shoulder when he \ncan seal a defender outside on a run up the middle. \nBriningstool moves his feet after contact and generates a push. He has success against linebackers and safeties. He can get beaten \nto the punch by a linebacker and anchor effectively to minimize the push into the pocket.  \nBriningstool can earn leverage as a short yardage reach blocker to get under the pads of a defensive end or outside linebacker, turn \nthe defender, and drop the opponent to the ground.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Briningstool works within two yards of the assignment and attacks with tight hands. He can secure his hands to \nthe chest of the opponent, close the gap further, and move his feet. He can be difficult for a defensive back to shed.  \nHe can cut the edge defender on a wind-back block. He delivers his cut with good timing. He keeps his eyes up to see what he’s \nhitting, and he across and through the target. Briningstool can improve the height of the cut—even if the outcome was effective.  \nWhen working against a linebacker who wants to redirect inside, Briningstool has an effective one-arm technique to keep the \ndefender from getting inside, and he pushes the opponent downhill with the leverage he gained.  \nAs a wind-back blocker, Briningstool has lapses where he overextends into contact.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Unless you’re in a 1.5 PPR league for tight ends and have a large roster, Briningstool is one of \nthose options who might prove good enough to deliver fantasy value off the waiver wire whenever injuries strike, but won’t hang \nonto an NFL starting role long-term.  \n \nUnless he develops a special relationship with an excellent quarterback to earn a starting role with weekly value, there are better \nshots at upside value in the middle rounds at other positions.  \n \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDives stem, extension vs oncoming contact, pull-back, contact balance/finish \n• \nTempos stem, settles into triangle, catch and pull-back from contact \n• \nJump up and through, pull-back, contested high point, boundary, embrace fall \n• \nIndirect balance vs Edge defender, obeys ball, pylon awareness, patience \n• \nJump up and through, one-handed and back-handed \n• \nJake Briningstool 2024 Highlights \n \n \n\n \n62",
        "analysis": "Jake Briningstool is a TE prospect with intriguing potential but significant inconsistencies.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Blocking:**  Briningstool possesses good blocking technique and effort, showing the ability to handle linebackers and even some defensive ends. His improved stance and hand placement are notable advancements.  He excels as a lead blocker and in short-yardage situations.\n* **Athleticism/Ball Carrying:** He's a capable ball carrier, showcasing elusiveness and power after the catch.  His vision and ability to create space are assets.  He efficiently transitions from catching to running.\n* **Route Running (Zone):**  Effective against zone coverages, he identifies openings and positions himself well for the quarterback. His releases from the line of scrimmage are strong.\n* **High-Point Catches:** He demonstrates the ability to make impressive acrobatic catches, particularly against tight coverage, showcasing good jump and body control.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Consistency:** His biggest weakness is inconsistency in catching the ball, especially when facing contact or tight coverage. Improving his hand strength and focus in these situations is crucial for his NFL success.\n* **Route Running (Man):** His route breaks need refinement, especially against man coverage, hindering his ability to create separation.\n* **Man Coverage:**  He needs to significantly improve his ability to win against man coverage.  Currently, he is a greater asset against zone defenses.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report provides a comparison spectrum ranging from high-ceiling players like Dalton Kincaid to lower-ceiling players like Brycen Hopkins and Jack Westover.  His ceiling is likened to Garrett Graham (a solid but not spectacular player), while his potential, *if* he improves his weaknesses, could reach the level of a rookie-year Dalton Kincaid.  The large range reflects his inconsistent performance and the significant room for improvement.  The comparison to Ja'Tavion Sanders is also notable.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nBriningstool projects as a potential rotational player or a high-end backup in the NFL. His blocking ability and occasional flashes of playmaking potential give him a high floor, but his inconsistent hands and struggles against man coverage are significant obstacles preventing him from becoming a reliable starter. His success hinges on drastically improving his ball-catching in contested situations.\n"

Big Draft likely has Bartholomew as a \nUDFA option hoping to make a practice squad because he’s not big enough for serious work as an inline blocker and not explosive \nenough as a receiving mismatch.  \nI have a lot of doubts about this working theory I’m about to propose, but I’m beginning to wonder if Big Draft analysts who spend \nso much time looking at offensive linemen—a position that’s rigid with his standards for height and weight relative to skill position \nprospects – become too rigid with how they assess skill talent. There’s logic for doing this with tight ends because they have \nresponsibilities along the line of scrimmage.  \n\n \n63 \nI also imagine most experienced analysts from the Big Draft set grade tight ends after splitting them into two categories: 1) Those \nwho do a lot of inline work and 2) Those who are more H-Backs and receivers.  \nStill, there are times when I see commentary where I wonder if this happens or if the standards given for each category are too \nrigid. The next time I go to an all-star game and run into some of these guys, it’s a conversation I’ll start. Theory aside, \nBartholomew strikes me as one of those potential UDFAs who not only makes a team, but also develops into quality second-string \ntight end who could deliver receiving production when called upon. \nBartholomew lacks the high-end athletic ability Big Draft seeks from tight ends that weigh less than 255 pounds. Although he’s one \nof the more technically sound blockers in this class, Big Draft will dismiss a 246-pound tight end outright as a factor at the line of \nscrimmage – and in most cases, rightfully so.  \nIt means Bartholomew’s game is in that limbo where he’s not quite explosive enough for one role and not big and strong enough for \nthe other. Then again, I’m looking at Zach Ertz’s player page at Pro Football Reference and at 249 pounds, he ran a 4.76-second 40 \nand has delivered a strong career as a starter. \nTo add to the point, Ertz’s Shuttle, 3-Cone, and Vertical performances were starter-grade, but not remotely elite tier. I’m not even \nbringing up Ertz as a 1:1 point of comparison for Bartholomew. The point is that prototypes, models, and cliché rules can remove \nsome of the subtlety and craft that has value. \nBartholomew is on par with Ertz as an athlete. He’s a little faster and he’s a promising route runner. Bartholomew as a healthy \nrepertoire of release moves and he executes many of them with violence. He also combines moves efficiently.  \nOnce into his stem, Bartholomew’s route setups are among the best in this class. He attacks leverage at full speed, which a lot of his \npeers don’t. This allows Bartholomew to deliver setups techniques with greater impact – stairsteps, peeks, and insets.  \nAlthough Bartholomew’s weight-drop into hard breaks isn’t optimal with specific break types, it’s present and there’s reason to \nbelieve it will improve when looking at other types where the drop has optimal depth. Bartholomew also enters his breaks at his top \nspeed, which many of the high-end athletes on this board don’t do at all.  \nSpeed doesn’t matter if you don’t use it in the right situations to manipulate opponents. Bartholomew’s speed meets the baseline for \ncompeting on an NFL field and how he uses it optimizes the raw material it is with route running.  \nBartholomew has no problem delivering flat speed turns. There’s also evidence at the end of the season that he’s developing a \nsudden snap with his breaks that I generally see only from the elite prospects or NFL veterans. There’s details in Bartholomew’s \nroute game.  \nThe layers of those details could narrow the margin between UDFA prospect we never hear about again and a long-time contributor \nwho may surprise us with starting production when called upon.  \nIt’s the pass-catching that could prove the tipping point for that thin margin between viable contributor and perennially practice \nsquad hopeful. Bartholomew tracks the ball well, especially over his shoulder. When the target is pinpoint or requires a small \nadjustment Bartholomew makes the play.  \nIt’s the extreme athletic adjustments that trip-up Bartholomew’s receiving game. When forced to fully extend his arms, his hands get \nwide and he’s prone to clap-attacking. This leads to drops.  \nThese are the plays that could determine Bartholomew’s chances to make an active roster. It depends on the experience of the \ncoach and executives.  \nThe blocking will be a hidden bonus. Bartholomew’s hands can get a little wide when stalk blocking, but as an inline blocker, he can \ndeliver sound strikes that help him control box defenders. He’s good at hooking opponents and turning them away from the ball \ncarrier. He’s also versatile with the type of blocks he can make and he counters the counters of his opponents.  \nIf Bartholomew was 10 pounds heavier with the same athletic ability and refined with full extensions for the ball, he might be a \nsleeper as an every-down starter who could be one of the 3-4 leaders in a passing offense.  \nAs it stands, Bartholomew is a deep sleeper from an NFL perspective because the skills are there to develop into a fixture on a roster \n– a reliable reserve who could grow into a niche role.  \nWhere has the player improved? By the end of the 2024 season, Bartholomew was snapping turns on routes that he wasn’t doing \nearlier in his career.  \nWhere is the player inconsistent? As a blocker and pass catcher, his hands get too wide when he extends them outward.  \n\n \n64 \nWhat is the best scheme fit? A spread offense where Bartholomew can ply his trade as a short and intermediate route runner \nagainst zone coverage at the boundary and man coverage in the middle of the field.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? Bartholomew improves his work at the catch point and delivers along the lines of Cade Otton – a \ngood blocker and underrated route runner coming out of Washington who stepped up when Baker Mayfield’s receiving corps dealt \nwith injury. \nWhat is his floor scenario? A perennial practice squad hopeful until he retires from football or plays in another league.  \nPhysical: Bartholomew is a good striker who has held his own with college linemen in the run game.  \nTechnical: His hand width is too wide when extending as a blocker and pass catcher.  \nConceptual: Bartholomew executes good counters with his hands as a route runner and inline blocker.  \nIntuitive: The subtleties of his setups are believable and not as robotic as most young tight end prospects.  \nBuild: Think Zach Ertz and Cade Otton. \nReleases: Bartholomew has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of \nhis front knee.  \nWhen releasing from the line of scrimmage, Bartholomew takes a step with his front foot. There is no other wasted motion.  \nWhen he doesn’t take a step with the front foot, he rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front foot. It would benefit him to \nlearn to sink into his stance and roll off the front foot. \nBartholomew comes off the line with his pads over his knees, selling the vertical potential of the route.  \nHe uses a double up at the top of stems to set up breaks on shallow routes. He counters the defender’s hands with a wipe when \napproaching the defender with a deep cushion in off-coverage. When releasing from an inline stance, he uses a read step to set up \ncoverage.  \nBartholomew reduces his shoulder from off-coverage to work inside. He combines a two-quick with a wipe when working up the \nseam. He also possesses a shed counter.  \nBartholomew delivers a stick inside and a swat counter to get outside on intermediate routes breaking downfield. He also has a swat-\nswim counter.  \nHe counters defenders’ hands with a double swat when facing them downfield in off-coverage. He uses a violent rip near the line of \nscrimmage when releasing from a three-point stance.  \nSeparation: He has enough speed to threaten linebackers up the seam, but he won’t overtake a safety playing a deep cushion 10-\n15 yards from the line of scrimmage.  \nRoute Stems: Bartholomew dives inside against inside leverage or uses the dive to set up a safety with a stairstep of the route. He \nalso widens stems to set up out-breaking routes as part of a stairstep.  \nRoute Setups: Bartholomew uses the stair-step technique against zone coverage. He has a subtle inset against off coverage playing \noutside shade up the seam. He attacks the leverage with good speed so the subtlety of the head fake and lean is believable. He then \ntakes the back of the defender into his speed turn.  \nHe also attacks the peek at full speed to sell the potential flag route or corner fade before breaking inside.  \nRoute Breaks: Bartholomew has a three-step break with a long break step preceding it. There is some weight drop into his break, \nbut not enough to achieve sudden deceleration. His weight drop is deeper when executing a three-step break at the top of an \nintermediate-range stem without the long break step. \nWith speed turns, Bartholomew delivers flat drive and line steps when using this turn as part of a double move for a vertical break. \nHe also delivers flat drive and line steps on intermediate speed turns and works back to the ball.  \nBartholomew doesn’t do this enough, but I’ve seen two reps in the Boston College game where he punches his boundary arm and \nsnaps his turn back to the quarterback.  \nBartholomew creates a friendly target for the quarterback.  \n\n \n65 \nZone Routes: Bartholomew identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly \ntarget to the quarterback. He’ll also tempo his breaks between zone defenders, showing his eyes only after he has crossed the \nbuzz/rollover defender.  \nIf his break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work downfield to help his quarterback as a receiver until the quarterback needs a blocker.  \nRoute Boundary: Bartholomew is aware of the boundary and turn his frame into the field of play when forced to leave his feet for a \ntarget.  \nPass Tracking: Bartholomew has a good eye for tracking the height of a target. He only leaves his feet when necessary to reach the \nball with a good attack with the exception of isolated lapses where there’s a small bunny hop with targets at chest level on in-\nbreaking routes.  \nBartholomew tracks the ball over his shoulder up the seam. One of his best skills as a receiver is tracking the ball over his shoulder \nand adjusting to targets of this type.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Bartholomew attacks targets at the earliest point of availability when the target is at chest or helmet level. \nHis overhand attack is sound.  \nWhen high-pointing targets, Bartholomew is prone to clap-attacking and it has led to dropped passes. He digs out low throws below \nhis knees with underhand attack, but when forced to make an athletic adjustment such as a full lay-out, Bartholomew’s hands are \ntoo far apart and he clap-attacks.  \nIt’s likely Bartholomey has difficulty keeping his hands together when an extreme athletic adjustment forces him to extend his arms \nfully to the ball. \nPosition: Bartholomew reinforces his position on vertical routes during his break to maintain distance between himself and the \ndefender. When he makes the catch away from his frame, he embraces the fall and is wise to turn so he’s falling in the field of play \nwhen he’s near the boundary.  \nFocus: He can take a cut to his legs as he finishes securing a target he tracked over his shoulder. He takes hits to his back while \ncatching a target near the boundary with overhand attack away from his frame.  \nTransitions: Bartholomew catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: Bartholomew can stick and bounce away from pursuit. He also has a good stick and spin combo.  \nVision: Although not used much on routes where there’s a yards component after the catch, Bartholomew is a patient and creative \nrunner in open space where there are more defenders than blockers. Bartholomew can press inside to collapse the coverage triangle \ntoward him and then use a single outside blocker to bounce the play to the boundary.  \nPower: Bartholomew has an accurate stiff arm and can push a defensive back to the ground with force. He pulls through reaches \nand leads with his pads in traffic. Bartholomew keeps his feet moving through wraps to drag or push box defenders downhill.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Bartholomew bounces off direct hits from cornerbacks in the open field.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Bartholomew bounces off glancing shots to his frame from safeties and linebackers. \nBall Security: Bartholomew secures targets to the boundary-side arm and keeps the ball high to his chest. His elbow is loose from \nhis side.  \nBlocking: As a stalk blocker, Bartholomew earns a square and squat stance, breaking down within two yards of the opponent. He \noverextends to the point that he’s off-balance and tipping off the defender. His hands are prone to being too wide.  \nAs an inline blocker, Bartholomew can hook a defensive end and turn him away from the path of the ball carrier. When he latches on \nwith a reach block, his hands can get wide, but he can keep his feet moving and sustain contact with the end’s pads to wall-off the \ndefender.  \nMore often as an inline blocker, Bartholomew’s hands are tight and he delivers them with an uppercut motion and closes the gap \nwith the edge defender. Bartholomew can deliver an uppercut off the line and roll his hips through the motion, standing up a \ndefensive end and driving the opponent off the line of scrimmage long enough for the running back to gain a small crease. He does \nthis well against defensive ends and other larger edge defenders on a repeatable scale.  \n\n \n66 \nBartholomew is skilled at taking the inside or outside shoulder of the defender at the line of scrimmage or as a stalk blocker and \nturning the defender away from the rushing lane. He’ll often turn the defender enough to take them off balance and pancake them to \nthe ground.  \nAs a windback blocker, Bartholomew can adjust to the flow of the edge defender down the line, bending inside to cut off the \ndefender. He’ll strike with his pads on the defender’s outside shoulder, turn the defender and transition to using his hands to keep \nthe defender in place.  \nAs a pass protector against edge defenders, Bartholomew earns square position with a strike. He’s also adept with chips as a part of \na double team. He’s forceful without overdoing the strike. His overextensions can get the better of him early.  \nWhen the defender redirects to the outside, Bartholomew redirects with the defender, getting his hands into the frame of the \ndefender while remaining tight to the opponent’s body. He moves well laterally to maintain leverage and push the defender around \nthe pocket.  \nAs a route runner, Bartholomew identifies when to transition from a receiver to a blocker. He’ll run off a defender as he’s working the \nscramble drill. When he sees the quarterback break the pocket, Bartholomew tilts into the defender and becomes a lead blocker.  \nDurability: Missed the final two games of 2023 with a lower leg injury that forced him to use crutches.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: There’s no need to draft Bartholomew unless he’s a surprise pick in the fourth round or higher and \nthat’s doubtful. He’s a player to monitor to see if he makes an active roster.  \n \nIf he earns the No. 2 role, the starter gets hurt, and you need a cheap play off waivers, Bartholomew could be a candidate for a \nspeculative addition. Think of Bartholomew as the Chris Brooks of tight ends this year – a better player than his draft status who \ncould show that he belongs in the league, even if it’s not in your fantasy format. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nInline blocker: uppercut and rolls hips  \n• \nWipe, reinforces separation, tracking, embraces fall, and turns away from boundary \n• \nStair-step, attacks leverage at full speed, subtle inset, flat speed turn back to QB \n• \nGavin Bartholomew Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n67",
        "analysis": "Gavin Bartholomew is a tight end prospect with a unique profile.  While his size (6'4\", 246 lbs) and athletic testing scores might not meet typical NFL standards for the position, his technical skills and nuanced route running give him a chance to make an NFL roster.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Technical Route Running:** Bartholomew possesses a refined set of release moves, excellent route setups (stair-steps, peeks, insets), and the ability to attack leverage effectively. He shows a surprising understanding of route nuances for a player of his experience level.  His speed, while not elite, is used efficiently to manipulate defenders. He demonstrates a developing \"snap\" in his breaks, a hallmark of elite players.\n* **Pass-Catching (Pinpoint Targets):**  He excels at catching pinpoint targets, demonstrating excellent ball tracking, particularly over his shoulder. His overhand attack is strong for targets at chest or helmet level.\n* **Blocking Prowess (Inline):**  Despite his weight, Bartholomew is a surprisingly effective inline blocker. He demonstrates sound striking technique, good leverage, and the ability to hook and turn defenders. He's particularly adept at uppercut blocks and driving larger defenders off the line.\n* **Versatility:**  He can transition smoothly from receiving to blocking, demonstrating an understanding of the game beyond his physical attributes.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Under-the-Radar Potential:**  Bartholomew's lack of elite athleticism might cause him to go undrafted, presenting an opportunity for a team to acquire a technically skilled player with upside.  His skillset defies simple categorization, potentially giving him an edge once he's in a system.\n* **Development Potential:**  His strengths in route running and blocking provide a solid foundation for development. Improvement in high-pointing the ball and hand placement during catches and blocks would significantly enhance his chances.  His late-season development of the \"snap\" in his breaks indicates a capacity for continued growth.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Size and Athleticism:** His weight is on the lower end for NFL tight ends, and he lacks the explosive athleticism typically sought after. This limits his potential as a dominant blocker in certain situations and might make him vulnerable in contested catches.\n* **Pass-Catching (Athletic Adjustments):** His hands get wide when making extreme athletic adjustments, leading to drops.  This is a significant area that needs refinement to improve his consistency as a receiver.\n* **Hand Placement:**  His tendency to overextend and have wide hands impacts both his blocking and receiving consistency.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report cites Zach Ertz and Cade Otton as potential comparisons.  This comparison highlights the potential for Bartholomew to succeed despite not fitting a traditional prototype.  He is more athletically similar to Zach Ertz than other TE prospects while mirroring Cade Otton's underrated route running and blocking ability.  However, it's important to note that this is not a direct 1:1 comparison; he needs significant development to reach their level of play.  The comparison emphasizes the potential for a player with a refined skillset to overcome physical limitations.  The Chris Brooks comparison highlights a player exceeding expectations despite a lower draft position.\n"

He has build-up speed, but his acceleration and quickness are not quite enough for him to earn the runway necessary \nto reach that top gear unless it’s the rare, slow-developing play-action target.  \nOn the other end of the spectrum, Lachey has a lot of effective skills as a blocker, but he ultimately has difficulty matching up with \nNFL-caliber edge defenders on his own as an in-line run blocker and pass protector. Teams want tight ends who can do what they \nneed from Column A (inline options) and hope for some bonus skills from Column B (receiving-heavy options) or vice versa.  \n\n \n68 \nWhere they have more difficulty is finding fits for tight ends who have some of Column A and some of Column B but not enough of \neither. This is where the grades for Lachey and Gavin Bartholomew are higher than the reality of their NFL assessment.  \nWhen looking purely and skills and athletic ability, they have solid grades. If I were to divide the position and grade them against \nstandards for Column A and Column B – which may eventually be my solution, Lachey and Bartholomew’s scores may be good as \ntalents, but not conducive for positional fits in the NFL.  \nLachey’s size fits the receiver archetype and he has competent hands, but his release work against man-to-man coverage needs \nmore tools. His hard breaks lack the sharpness and deceleration to win in the NFL, but he shows the physical skills to do so as a ball \ncarrier in the open field and with work, he can translate it to route running.  \nHe’s competent after the catch, but not a weapon that presents mismatches on the field. This is essentially the best way to sum up \nLachey. There are many areas where he could prove competent as a backup, but his complement of skills are a little bit of Column A-\nColumn B when there are a lot more talents who are full-fledged square or round pegs instead of a pentagon or octagon.  \nWhere has the player improved? His effectiveness as a combo blocker. \nWhere is the player inconsistent? His attack of targets can lack uniformity of hand position with specific target types. \nWhat is the best scheme fit? A second or third tight end in an offense that uses multiple tight ends.  \nWhat is his ceiling scenario? A second tight end capable of stop-gap production in the passing game.  \nWhat is his floor scenario? A practice squad hopeful.  \nPhysical: He can drop his weight, but he must apply it to route running.  \nReleases: Lachey has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee. \nWhen Lachey begins his release, he’s prone to raising the heel of his back foot before rolling off his front foot. If he can curtail the \nwasted motion and sink into his stance, Lachey could sell his stems more effectively because there will be greater urgency of \nmovement.  \nLachey dives his stems against inside leverage. He counters the hands of the defender with a wipe. His counters lack violence and \nprecision. He also should develop more—especially footwork to set up the hand counters.  \nFrom a three-point stance, Lachey uses a read step to begin his release off the line.  \nLachey uses a two-quick at the top of stems where he breaks inside. He’ll set it up with a shoulder reduction. Usually you see the \nfeet precede the upper-body move.  \nLachey combines a read step with a shed against coverage from his three-point stance. As a detached receiver, Lachey uses a read \nstep with a lean-in. \nSeparation: Lachey has shown starter speed based on in-game speed tracking.  \nHis best work downfield is attacking intermediate and vertical seams against zone coverage. He beats many linebackers. If a safety \ngets sucked into a play fake, that safety isn’t catching Lachey unless the target is underthrown. \nRoute Stems: Lachey will dive or widen his stems to attack leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Lachey can take the defender’s back after stemming to turn the defender’s hips downhill.  \nRoute Breaks: Lachey has a quick three-step break into a speed turn when running intermediate routes. The three-step break lacks \nweight drop that could help him decelerate quicker.  \nLachey has shown as an open-field runner that he can drop his weight and decelerate fast. He must apply this to route running. The \nfact he does it as a runner is promising.  \nThe speed turn has flat drive and line steps. He gets his head around early and creates a friendly target to the quarterback.  \nZone Routes: Lachey identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across zones. He doesn’t show his \neyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \n\n \n69 \nLachey also settles into open zones when the breaks are back to the quarterback. If the first area closes up, he shuffles his feet to \nmaintain a friendly target while working to the next open area.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary and toe-taps to get his feet inbounds.  \nPass Tracking: Lachey tracks the ball over his shoulder with overhand position.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Lachey turns effectively behind his break path and catches targets. He can use underhand attack close to his \nframe at the beltline. With targets that would require underhand attack with a track over the shoulder, Lachey is prone to using high-\nlow hand position to clap-attack the ball.  \nLachey can also attack the ball away from his frame when the targets is at his beltline. When breaking across the field, Lachey can \nextend his arms below his knees to pluck the ball. Lachey also high points effectively.  \nPosition: Lachey can embrace the fall when forced off his feet to complete a catch. He has an effective pull-back against tight \ncoverage.  \nFocus: Lachey can take hits and wraps to his back as he catches targets facing the quarterback in the shallow zone. He also makes \ncatches against tight coverage where the defender can pull at his hands near his chest.  \nLachey high points and takes hits to his chest or back as he does so.  \nTransitions: Lachey catches and pierces. He also obeys the direction of the pass to transition downhill according to the target.  \nElusiveness: Lachey spins through contact to get his frame downfield so he can at least extend forward through tackles. Lachey \nonly needs two quick steps with weight drop to decelerate in the open field and force backside pursuit to overrun it’s angle.  \nVision: Lachey is aware of the sticks and works through contact to extend for the marker. He tracks pursuit on the periphery and \ncan set up cutbacks against them.  \nPower: He keeps his feet moving when linebackers wrap him high. He can generate some downhill push or pull through contact. He \ncan earn 5-7 yards when he has momentum into gang tackle attempts from linebackers and secondary defenders.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He bounces off safeties delivering glancing shots.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Lachey can drop the pads and win a collision with a cornerback in the open field, running the defender \nover and earning yardage after the catch. He can balance-touch through the contact.  \nBall Security: Lachey carries the ball high to his chest. He tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm, but there are lapses where he \ndefaults to his right arm. His elbow is too loose from his frame unless he’s running toward heavy traffic.  \nBlocking: Lachey is quick enough to hook the outside shoulder of a force linebacker and run him inside the ball carrier on a \nperimeter play.  \nWhen combo blocking where he peels off a double team of the defensive end to the linebacker or safety, Lachey doesn’t overwork \nthe double-team if his teammate has the block under control and this prevents Lachey from overrunning his assignment against the \nsecond-level defender.  \nLachey is also wise about avoiding the defensive end’s penetration on a lead block where working downfield toward the safety or \ncornerback is more helpful. Taking on the end would have clogged the rush lane whereas Lachey’s choice gave the running back an \neasier path to avoid the penetrating box defender.  \nAs a backside blocker cutting off a linebacker, Lachey can overextend his frame as he delivers a meaningful uppercut punch with \ntight hands into the defender’s chest. Lachey would improve his efforts if he closed the gap tighter before throwing the uppercut and \nalso rolling through the hips when he delivered the strike. He’d have more control because he’d be in a tighter position to the \nopponent.  \nDefensive ends can throw Lachey around when he attempts cutoff blocks. He’s not going to win one-on-one in these settings with \nedge defenders.  \nAs a pass protector, Lachey moves his feet laterally with a wide stance and can remain square with a box defender at about the \nwidth of one gap. He slides effectively to the edge of the pocket against edge pressure that lacks deep bend of corners you see from \nNFL starters.  \nLachey can pull across the box and wall-off a pass rusher on a play-action pass.  \n\n \n70 \nWhen blocking the front-side defensive end on sprint passes, Lachey can take a shot to the chest and anchor his stance well enough \nto redirect and put up a battle for at least a few steps.  \nLachey’s overextensions off the line as an inline blocker can give edge defenders an early jump to avoid Lachey altogether.  \nLachey is an effective stalk blocker on RPOs and screens. He has the size and technique to win against most defensive backs at the \ncollege level, sustaining his efforts long enough for holes to open up along his path.  \nLachey makes quick and accurate decisions with Most Dangerous Man assignments. If he knows he can’t reach his primary \nassignment, he peels off to the next Most Dangerous Man and reaches it.  \nDurability: Right ankle injury in 2023 that cost him all but three games and required surgery.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: There’s no need to draft Lachey. He may get drafted because of logo scouting compared to a \nslightly better player with more upside potential in Gavin Bartholomew. He’s a player to monitor to see if he can earn an opportunity \nto grow into a stop-gap contributor.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLuke Lachey Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n71",
        "analysis": "Luke Lachey is a TE prospect with a unique profile, making him a difficult evaluation.  His strengths lie in his size (6'5\", 251 lbs), competent hands, and ability to make plays after the catch. He displays starter-level speed in game situations, particularly excelling at attacking intermediate and vertical seams against zone coverage.  He's also a capable combo blocker, showing awareness and making smart decisions in avoiding overcommitment.  However, his weaknesses are significant. His route running needs refinement, lacking the sharpness and deceleration to consistently win against NFL-level defenders in man coverage. His blocking, while competent in certain situations (combo blocks, stalk blocks), is insufficient for consistent one-on-one matchups against NFL edge rushers.  He's also had injury concerns, missing most of the 2023 season due to ankle surgery.\n\n**Opportunities:**  Lachey's athleticism and size give him a foundation to build upon.  Improving his route running technique and adding more violence to his hand counters could significantly enhance his receiving ability.  Further development of his pass protection skills could also raise his floor.  He is best suited for a team utilizing multiple tight ends, allowing him to focus on specific roles where his strengths are most applicable.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:** The report compares him to Zach Ertz, Cade Otton, and Gavin Bartholomew. This comparison highlights his in-between status:  not quite the complete receiving threat of Ertz, not as polished a blocker as Otton, and similarly possessing the blend of receiving and blocking skills (but not enough of either to excel) as Bartholomew. The report emphasizes that while his skillset is solid, the lack of dominance in either receiving or blocking could limit his NFL success.\n\n**Summary:** Lachey is a developmental prospect who could potentially carve a niche as a rotational player or backup tight end. However, his ceiling is limited due to the lack of a clearly defined strength in receiving or blocking. His NFL future will heavily depend on coaching and the ability to polish his existing skill set, addressing the fundamental weaknesses in his game. He's a high-risk, low-reward draft pick, making him more of a project player than a guaranteed contributor.\n"

His \nceiling is likely capped as a second or third tight end because he’s not a dominant receiver.  \nMatavao builds speed, but like Luke Lachey, it takes too long for him to reach a pace where he can earn separation from coverage. \nThis limits Matavao’s viable routes to zone coverage in the underneath passing game as well as intermediate routes breaking to the \nboundary. \nHe’s a technically-sound route runner at this stage of his development, and he could grow into a skilled zone receiver who can \nmanipulate off-coverage defenders before settling into open space or tempoing his breaks across the field.  \n\n \n72 \nAfter the catch, Matavao looks like an imposing runner but he goes down easily—even when smaller defenders wrap him high. Unless \nMatavao was playing through a difficult injury, his work as a ball carrier is disappointing for his size.  \nGive Matavao space to operate and blockers, and he’s patient and creative within the bounds of his athletic limitations.  \nAs a blocker, Matavao operates well inline. When forced to close distance with opponents, Matavao is guilty of overextending and his \nhands can get too wide at the point of attack.  \nThe exception is as a lead blocker. Matavao is patient and adjusts well to changing angles of pursuit to reach his assignment. He also \ntakes good angles to hook and turn defenders.  \nMatavao won’t be lighting up box scores as a receiver, but he could become a valued special teams option and second or third tight \nend who can help the run and operate in space.  \nReleases: Matavao has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee. When he begins his release, Matavao sinks into his stance and rolls off his front foot. His back foot may have the slightest \nrocking motion before he rolls off the front foot, but it’s so indiscernible that it’s probably not worth mentioning unless he \ndemonstrates lapses with far more pronounced rocking motion.  \nMatavao has a violent swat to counter the hands of coverage. He also uses the swat-swim to work outside the off-coverage. He sets \nthe swat-swim counter up with a stick to the inside. He has a two-quick to attack outside leverage and setup and inside release.  \nMatavao also uses a wipe at the top of stems. He reduces his shoulder from reaches.  \nMatavao uses a read step inside to set up shallow out-breaking routes. He uses a feet-switch against tight coverage at the line to \nrelease inside. He can counter the defender’s hands with a shed.  \nMatavao has an effective double up on a quick slant. He uses a stick with a lean-in counter for a quick out. He likes the stick-and-\nswat combo, too.  \nSeparation: Matavao lacks short-area acceleration and quickness, but he can build speed. Give him an unfettered runway and he \ncan challenge a high safety sliding toward the boundary to cover him.  \nRoute Stems: Matavao dives inside with stems against off-coverage with inside shade.  \nRoute Setups: Matavao can stairstep an off-coverage defender with a dive inside and then straightening the rest of the stem before \nbreaking back to the inside.  \nRoute Breaks: When executing speed turns, Matavao earns flat drive and line steps and gets his head around early in the break. He \ndrops his weight effectively with breaks back to the quarterback, including at the end of a three-step break. Matavao also drops his \nweight effectively into the flat speed turn as well as a drop and pop break. \nZone Routes: Matavao identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He creates a friendly \ntarget for his quarterback.  \nWhen Matavao’s first route doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work with his quarterback when his quarterback breaks the pocket. He’s \neffective at earning depth in an open zone as he tempos his breaks across the field to maximize his position.  \nMatavao snaps his turns on breaks back to the quarterback and it’s sudden thanks to him punching the boundary-side arm.  \nRoute Boundary: Although called out of bounds for illegal touching on a 3rd and 9 pass against Washington, I didn’t see Matavao \nstep out of bounds. In fact, he showed the awareness to keep his heel off the boundary and stay inbounds. \nPass Tracking: Matavao tracks shallow targets over his shoulder and uses overhand attack to do so.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Matavao attacks targets on the numbers with overhand position. He catches targets at this height with his \nhands away from his chest and at the earliest point of arrival. He can also attack high and away from his frame.  \nMatavao attacks targets at the beltline with underhand position. He earns targets at his back shoulder with overhand attack.  \nPosition: I didn’t see him in scenarios where he had to create position against a defender to win a target.  \nFocus: Matavao can take contact to his chest as he secures the ball. He can catch shallow targets against tight coverage while facing \nthe quarterback.  \n\n \n73 \nTransitions: Matavao obeys the ball and catches and pierces downhill.  \nElusiveness: In the open field, Matavao can give a leg to a downfield pursuer with a stick and then take it away with a spin – \nlayering the two moves in succession. Matavao only needs 2-3 steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway.  \nVision: Matavao is a patient runner on TE screens, setting up blocks on linebackers and/or defensive backs, but he’s mostly a \nstraight-line ball carrier who barrels downhill. He’s not going to make a lot of stop-start movements or set up runs that require \nlateral cuts.  \nPower: Matavao uses a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame and forces opponents to go low. He keeps his feet moving through \nwraps and, if he has momentum, he forces linebackers and safeties to slide down to his lower legs to wrap up or get dragged for 5-6 \nyards.  \nHis body type makes him appear more powerful than he is. Defensive backs often wrap him at his power base and limit him to \nminimal gains.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Matavao bounces off hits to his chest from cornerbacks and can continue downhill. He can run over a \nsafety.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Matavao bounces off glancing shots to his lower legs from safeties.  \nBall Security: Matavao carries the ball under his boundary-side arm and high to his chest. He can take a hit to the ball-carrying arm \nand maintain possession. Matavao has lapses where he tucks the ball to his right arm by default despite working outside the left \nhash and pursuit to his right arm.  \nBlocking: From a three-point stance at the line, Matavao closes the gap with his opponent, getting chest to chest with the defender \nand driving the opponent backward with his hands under the defender’s arms and balanced footwork. \nMatavao’s stance has a wide base that helps him anchor against linemen. He overextends against box defender coming off the line \nfrom a three-point stance, but he can redirect and earn the side of the defender who beat him with the first move and drive that \ndefender out of the play.  \nMatavao reaches the second-level of the defense quickly as a combo blocker and earns a square position against linebackers. His \nhands should be tighter at the point of attack, but he eliminates the gap between himself and the defender. \nMatavao is nimble enough from a three-point stance to work his way to the inside shoulder of the force linebacker and turn the \ndefender away from the path of the play.  \nMatavao has a patient approach as a lead blocker and closes steadily against defensive backs, earning good position.  \nWhen working across as a wind-back blocker or puller, Matavao works to the inside shoulder of the force player to turn him away \nfrom the crease.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Matavao breaks down within two yards of a defensive back, but he can take an extra step or two that overruns \nthe angle that would force the defender to work through Matavao rather than around him.   \nMatavao transitions well from route runner to blocker. He’ll also run off a defender and tilt into him.  \nDurability: Missed the Iowa game in 2024. Played in every other game. No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Matavao could have waiver-wire appeal as a stopgap fantasy option one day as the poor man’s Will \nDissly who earns some play-action targets in open space against teams that are focusing on Matavao’s teammates. Monitor from \nafar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nStance, release, speed turn, obeys the ball, contact and contact balance \n• \nSnaps turn with punch of boundary-side arm on route breaking back to QB \n• \nBack shoulder, good tracking, contact, and embracing the fall  \n• \nMoliki Matavao Highlights \n \n \n \n \n\n \n74",
        "analysis": "Moliki Matavao is a tight end prospect projected as a potential contributor/starter in a limited role (Depth of Talent Score: 78).  His NFL comparison is John Bates.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Reliable Pass Catcher:** Matavao is a technically sound route runner with a high catch percentage, particularly on pinpoint targets. He excels at manipulating off-coverage defenders in zone situations and finding open space.  He displays good tracking and secures the catch even with contact.\n* **Solid Inline Blocker:** He's effective as an inline blocker, demonstrating good technique and the ability to drive defenders backward.  He's particularly strong as a lead blocker, showing patience and adjusting well to changing angles.\n* **Good Size and Build:** His 6'6\", 263-pound frame makes him a presence both as a receiver and blocker, though his power doesn't always translate to effective running after the catch.\n* **Transition from Route to Block:**  Matavao shows a smooth transition between his pass-catching and blocking duties.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improving Run After Catch:** While he shows some power, he goes down easily, even against smaller defenders. Improving his ball-carrying ability would significantly boost his overall value.\n* **Developing Short-Area Quickness:** His lack of short-area quickness limits his route tree. Improving his acceleration would open up more opportunities to create separation.\n* **Special Teams Contributions:**  He has the potential to contribute significantly on special teams, adding to his overall value.\n* **Becoming a Versatile Tight End:** His skillset allows for the possibility of becoming a more complete tight end if he improves his run after catch and short-area quickness.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Elite Receiving Ability:**  His ceiling is likely limited to a second or third tight end role due to his lack of elite receiving skills and separation ability.  He struggles to consistently create separation from coverage, especially in man situations.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** While generally a good blocker, he sometimes overextends and his hand placement needs refinement.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison (John Bates):** This comparison highlights Matavao's strengths as a reliable pass catcher and inline blocker, but suggests he lacks the dynamic athleticism and receiving upside of a top-tier tight end.  Bates carved out a role in the NFL with his blocking ability and consistency, mirroring Matavao's projected path.\n"

Technically skilled with releases against coverage, Nesbit has potential value as a man-to-man receiver in a big slot role or \nmatched up with less athletic defenders on the perimeter.  \nNesbit has route skills to build on with releases, stems, setups, and breaks. He isn’t an elite pass-catcher, but he’s firmly in the \nstarter tier and reliable enough to earn targets in the NFL.  \nAs a blocker, Nesbit has potential to assist the inline tight end on double teams or deliver as an H-Back. He has upside as a lead \nblocker or wind-back blocker once he curbs his tendency to throw his body around recklessly.  \n\n \n75 \nThe ultimate problem with Nesbit is that he’s athletic enough to be on a team, but lacks a skill that elevates his game to a starting \nrole. He’s neither big nor fast enough to thrive as a primary weapon at tight end and some teams may prefer one of their receivers \nplay the big slot role because they offer as much there and more outside.  \nHe’ll need the right system fit, rapid development, and a great rapport with a proven quarterback to emerge as anything more than \nan option competing for a spot at the end of the roster.  \nReleases: Nesbit has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands hang at either side of his \nfront knee.  \nWhen Nesbit releases from the line, he rocks off the back foot before rolling off the front food. He can sink into his stance, but he \nalso rocks off his back foot. He has reps where he doesn’t rock off the back foot and there’s no wasted motion at all, but they are \nfewer than the ones with wasted motion.  \nNesbit uses a double up at the top of his stem to set up an in-breaking route. He uses a shed to counter the defender’s hands who is \nplaying outside shade.  \nNesbit uses a three-quick break to set up an inside break. He uses a two-quick to set up an outside release.  \nNesbit can improve his selection of counters to a defender’s hands. He combines a shoulder reduction with a swat from the opposite \nhand when it would be more efficient to use a blade release with the inside arm.  \nNesbit sells the vertical with his pads over his knees. At the top of his first break, Nesbit delivers an effective shed. He reduces his \nshoulder from outside leverage.  \nNesbit uses a feet-switch at the line to set up an inside release. He combines a stick mid-step with a wipe at the top of the stem. If \nthe wipe doesn’t work, he’ll follow up with a swim with the other arm.  \nNesbit combines a dive inside, a double up, and a lean-in to set up a break outside against off coverage.  \nHe’ll steal a release in the run game with a stutter or a two-quick.  \nSeparation: Nesbit can get a step up the seam against a safety in the intermediate and vertical ranges of the field. On deep \ncrossers, he can earn a step on a cornerback. He can beat near-side safeties and cornerbacks with angles over the top of him as he \nworks up the boundary. His 40-Yard-Dash number does not match his film. \nRoute Stems: Nesbit dives inside and then stairsteps vertical routes. He widens outside leverage on vertical routes.  \nRoute Setups: Nesbit stair-steps vertical routes against off-coverage. He’ll deliver a stick and head fake to the inside against \ncoverage over the top on a vertical route.  \nNesbit has a quick but well-executed peek to the fade against off-coverage. He turns his head, pads, and chest outside two steps \nnear the top of his stem.  \nNesbit does the same with an inset in the red zone.  \nRoute Breaks: Nesbit has flat drive and line steps on speed turns and snaps the turn, getting his head around out of the break and \npresenting a friendly position to the quarterback. He runs speed outs at a good pace.  \nWhen Nesbit’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he can uncover quickly against a defender shading him across the field.  \nNesbit has a long break step into a drop and pop with good weight drop. There are occasional lapses where he doesn’t drop his \nweight into this type of break.  \nHe also has weight drop when he delivers a long break step into a three-step break. Nesbit also slides back toward the quarterback \nout of the break.  \nZone Routes: Nesbit identifies the second level of the zone, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the zone between the \ndefenders. Nesbit also knows when to settle into the open area.  \nWhen the first break doesn’t earn a target, Nesbit works with the quarterback to a different area. When tempoing his breaks, Nesbit \nshows his eyes too early. He doesn’t wait to clear the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Nesbit drags his feet as he falls to the ground near the boundary.  \n\n \n76 \nPass Tracking: Nesbit tracks with overhand position over the shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Nesbit uses overhand and underhand attack effectively. He high points and extends his arms to the earliest \npoint of the target’s arrival. He also catches targets at his chest at the earliest point of arrival. He has difficulty digging out low \nthrows.  \nPosition: Nesbit embraces the fall.  \nFocus: Nesbit can take a hit to his back while catching a target at his chest with overhand position.  \nTransitions: Nesbit catches and pierces downhill.   \nElusiveness: Nesbit gets his feet over low shots and reaches to his ankles. He uses a spin to work away from impending contact. \nVision: Nesbit is a decisive runner who can make the first unblocked man miss but he’s more of a straight-line guy once he has built \nmomentum downhill. He may have patience but after watching three years of his tape, most of his work after the catch is open-field \nwork where no nuance is needed.  \nPower: Nesbit runs through reaches to his lower body. His stiff-arm wards off reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Nesbit drops his pads and runs through direct contact to his legs and chest from a cornerback.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Nesbit runs through the cut of his legs to fall forward into the end zone.  \nBall Security: Nesbit carries the ball close to his chest but has lapses where he swings the ball as he runs, so the elbow is loose \nfrom his side. When these lapses aren’t present, Nesbitt keeps the elbow tight to his side.  \nNesbit uses his boundary-side arm to carry the ball.  \nBlocking: Nesbitt will work to the inside shoulder against the force defender, but using a one-arm technique in this situation is a bad \nchoice and costs Nesbitt his balance.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Nesbit overextends into the collision, but he has an uppercut and rolls through his hips when he lands it. He keeps \nhis feet moving after contact. He can turn the defender at the inside shoulder and move the defender outside the path of the ball \ncarrier.  \nHe can keep his hands tight when he uppercuts into a defender’s chest on a reach block.  \nNesbit executes wind-backs to the force player, aiming for the inside shoulder to turn the opponent when he strikes with his pads. \nNesbit uses the same approach and strike as a lead blocker to the play-side edge on a linebacker.  \nNesbit transitions smoothly from vertical route runner to blocker, setting up the defender over him with a stairstep and then tilting \ninto the opponent he ran off. He earns tight position on the defender and gets his hands inside.  \nFor good and for bad, Nesbit isn’t afraid to throw his body around. He’ll peel off an assignment inside to fan out and throw his \nshoulder into an edge defender earning penetration.  \nHe sets up second-level and edge defenders with his initial approach to earn position to seal them inside or outside.  \nDurability: Nesbit suffered a wrist fracture in 2024 that required surgery and cost him games after mid-October. Missed 2023 bowl \ngame due to injury.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nOut and up with good release, speed turn, shed, tracking, and contact balance  \n• \nSpeed out, flat break, embraces fall, boundary awareness and execution \n• \nTE Screen: High point at earliest window, agility, stiff arm, and contact balance \n• \nBryson Nesbit 2024 Highlights \n• \nBryson Nesbit 2023 Highlights \n \n \n \n\n \n77",
        "analysis": "Bryson Nesbit is a TE prospect with intriguing athleticism but inconsistencies in his game.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Athleticism and Speed:** Nesbit's speed is a significant asset, exceeding what his combine numbers might suggest.  He displays good agility and elusiveness after the catch.\n* **Route Running:** Possesses solid route-running skills, showing proficiency in releases, stems, setups, and breaks. He's particularly effective at creating separation on deep crossers and against safeties. He demonstrates an understanding of zone coverage.\n* **Blocking Potential:** Shows potential as a blocker, capable of double-teaming and acting as an H-back.  He has the tools to be a lead or wind-back blocker with improved technique.\n* **Hands and Catch Radius:**  He effectively uses both overhand and underhand techniques, high-pointing the ball and extending his arms.  He's capable of catching at his chest with good focus even under contact.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Refinement of Blocking Technique:**  He needs to refine his blocking technique to minimize reckless body throws and improve his hand usage.\n* **Consistency in Route Running:** While possessing good route-running skills,  he needs to improve his counter moves against defenders' hands and avoid showing his eyes too early in zone routes.\n* **Improving Ball Security:** While typically carrying the ball well, he occasionally exhibits lapses in securing the ball during runs.\n* **Finding the Right System:** His success hinges on finding the right NFL system that fits his skillset and allows him to contribute effectively.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lacks Elite Skill:**  He doesn't possess an elite trait that would propel him to a clear starting role. He isn't exceptionally big or fast enough to dominate at tight end.  Some teams may prefer a receiver in the big slot role due to versatility.\n* **Durability Concerns:**  He has a history of injuries, including a wrist fracture requiring surgery.\n* **Catching Low Throws:** He struggles with catching low throws.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Jordan Reed.  This comparison highlights Nesbit's athleticism and receiving potential, but also implies a similar injury history and potential inconsistency that may limit his overall impact.  However, this comparison should be considered cautiously, as Reed's skill set was ultimately more refined than what is presently observed in Nesbit.  He could potentially develop into a role player in a system that capitalizes on his athleticism.\n"

Scroll down to the Durability section and you’ll learn why.  \nNeville is more likely to show his badassery as a special teamer than an offensive weapon. However, I wouldn’t put it past Neville to \ndevelop into a competent backup who can serve as a stopgap H-Back for a team that uses this role in its scheme.  \nNeville’s route game is still a work in progress but he is developing in a way that could one day become acceptable for the NFL. He’s \nnot elite athletically, but his speed is good enough to compete and win against underneath coverage – zone and man-to-man.  \nNeville catches the ball well. He wins targets that require athletic adjustments. He earns position against tight coverage to win the \nball, and he can take contact to make the play.  \n\n \n78 \nNeville is patient, determined, and rugged enough after the catch to move the chains against off-ball linebackers and defensive \nbacks. He’s a smart decision maker who can create against unblocked defenders within the realm of his athletic gifts.  \nHe’s effective as a lead blocker, stalk blocker, and part of double teams. He earns good angles, has good grip strength for these \nplays, and moves well.  \nIt’s unlikely Neville ever becomes a box score factor with any level of predictability, but he could emerge as a valued reserve or \nspecial teams ace.  \nReleases: Neville has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg when detached from the offensive \nline. He sinks into his stance to begin his release and he rolls off his front foot without wasted motion.  \nHe uses a read step with a wipe counter against off-coverage. He reduces his shoulder when working from a three-point stance.  \nNeville has a two-quick against off-coverage and will attempt a swat-swim counter to the defender’s hands. He’s more successful \nwhen working out of a three-point stance against a safety instead of linebacker.  \nNeville’s feet-switch is effective when operating as a detached receiver. He also uses it to steal a release in the run game.  \nSeparation: Neville can work up the seam and beat some linebackers. He may challenge safeties who are out of position.  \nRoute Stems: This is an area of his game where he can add techniques and concepts to improve his routes.  \nRoute Setups: There is some pace variation with Neville’s routes at the top of his stems. He can deliver a compact stair-step \nagainst shallow off-coverage on a shallow out route.  \nRoute Breaks: Neville uses a two-step break with intermediate in-breaking routes. There’s not enough weight drop to decelerate \nquickly. His speed turns aren’t flat with this break type.  \nWhen he executes a speed turn without the two- or three-step break/deceleration, his drive and line steps are flat.  \nNeville has the makings of a drop-and-pop break, but he must deliver it with weight drop to generate effective deceleration if it’s \ngoing to work against tight coverage or a defender in zone with position to jump the route if the deceleration isn’t effective. He has \nexecuted the drop-and-pop break with a long break step into the drop-and-pop turn.  \nNeville executed breaks with more weight drop as the season progressed. In the Notre Dame game, his weight drop into this three-\nstep break was nearly acceptable.  \nZone Routes: Neville identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He presents a friendly \ntarget with a quick turn. The turn could be sudden if he punched the boundary-side arm through the turn.  \nWhen working between zone defenders, he tempos his breaks and doesn’t show his eyes until he has passed the zone/rollover \ndefender.  \nWhen his initial break doesn’t earn a target, Neville works with the quarterback to find an open space and maintains a friendly target \nposition so he can be read for the ball when he reaches open space.  \nRoute Boundary: Neville is aware of the boundary and can toe-tap at the catch to remain in the field of play. \nPass Tracking: Neville tracks the ball over his shoulder with overhand position on shallow routes.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Neville high points the ball effectively. He digs out low throws with underhand attack. He extends for targets \naway from his frame with overhand attack and can make catches with his fingertips, including targets far enough from his frame that \nhe can get a gentler second-chance opportunity after the initial attempt was just off his fingertips.  \nHe attacks targets at the earliest window of arrival when he can use overhand attack.  \nPosition: Neville can deliver a pull back when high-pointing against tight coverage. He must learn to embrace the fall after a high \npoint. He can do it when digging out low throws below his knees.  \nFocus: Nevile an take contact to his back as he secures the football. He can win against contact with high points and extensions \naway from his frame that leads him a little further than pinpoint.  \nTransitions: Neville will catch and pierce after catching a target while facing the quarterback. He obeys the trajectory of the ball to \ndetermine the direction of his catch and pierce.  \n\n \n79 \nElusiveness: Neville has a nice two-quick move in the open field to freeze a linebacker or safety and work past. He’ll spin through \ncontact to extend forward or continue downhill. He only needs two steps to transition from a perimeter approach to the far side of \nthe field to a downhill path.  \nVision: Neville splits defenders in the open field and shows the patience to set up on before making his move downhill. He takes \nsmart risks to move the chains in the open field.  \nPower: Neville keeps his feet moving when wrapped high. He has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He can pull \nthrough wraps to his leg from box defenders. He can keep his feet when multiple defenders gang tackle high, giving his teammates a \nchance to rally to him and generate a push. \nHe’ll drag linebackers wrapped around his torso when he has some downhill momentum and they are attacking from a trail position.   \nDirect Contact Balance: Neville can bounce off direct contact from an off-ball linebacker and force the defender to wrap up.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Neville bounces off glancing shots to his shoulder and side from a safety and continues forward. He has \nan effective balance-touch to at least generate forward lean after losing his balance.  \nBall Security: Neville secures the ball high to his chest, but the elbow is loose from his frame. He can take contact to the ball-\ncarrying arm. He tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: Neville sinks his hips into a wide stance, shuffles his feet effectively when moving laterally, and earns a tight position into \na defender’s side or chest. He moves well enough to lead block when he can take one side of a linebacker or defensive back and \ngenerate a push.  \nAs a pass protector, Neville fits best as a blocker in a double-team with box defenders. He moves well enough laterally to deliver \nquick punches to wall off a defender and redirect the opponent into an offensive lineman. He also spots delayed pressure from the \nsecond level and knows when to peel off his double-team to square the delayed pressure working around the edge.  \nWhen stalk blocking as a detached receiver, Neville can work inside-out—aiming for the inside shoulder—and turn the defender’s \nback to the boundary.  \nWhen working to the second level of the defense as a run blocker, Neville attacks with force, but strikes with his forearms rather \nthan his open hands. He overextends into the strike.  \nWhen leading the way with perimeter runs as a reach blocker, Neville spots the leverage point with a force defender and exploits it \nwith one-arm technique into the arm pit of the defender. This knocks the defender off-balance and allows Neville to push the \ndefender out of the play.   \nNeville earns a square position in the crease against a linebacker as a puller on Counter. He delivers an uppercut punch and rolls \nthrough his hips to generate movement off the linebacker’s spot.  \nWhen he locks onto a defender with his hands, he’s difficult to dislodge at the line of scrimmage.  \nDurability: Neville has a long story in regard to his health, including more than 20 childhood surgeries and Stage 2 Hodgkin’s \nLymphoma diagnosis in high school. He played in every game at Harvard and UVA.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nHigh point, pull-back vs tight coverage \n• \nPuller on Counter: Square position, uppercut strike, rolls through hips, and walks LB out \n• \nDigs out low throw and embraces the fall vs contact \n• \nTakes on two defenders at once to buy time for puller \n• \nTyler Neville Harvard Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n80",
        "analysis": "## Tyler Neville Player Profile Summary:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Reliable hands and catch radius:**  Neville consistently catches the ball well, excels at high-pointing, and makes difficult catches, even extending his frame to secure targets. He shows good ball tracking, especially on shallow routes.\n* **Toughness and contact balance:** He's incredibly durable, having overcome significant health challenges, and plays through contact effectively. He maintains balance after taking hits, showcasing good strength and body control after the catch.\n* **Blocking ability:**  Neville is a solid blocker, effective in lead, stalk, and double-team situations. He shows good technique and leverage, demonstrating potential as a run blocker and pass protector.\n* **Good route running potential:** While his route running needs refinement, he shows flashes of good technique, especially in zone routes where he identifies openings and presents a good target. He displays some effective release techniques.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route running development:** This is a key area for improvement. Refining his route stems, breaks, and deceleration will significantly increase his effectiveness as a receiver.\n* **Increased athleticism:** While his speed is adequate, improving his overall athleticism could elevate his playmaking ability.\n* **Special teams value:** His toughness and blocking skills make him a valuable asset on special teams, potentially securing a roster spot through that avenue.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Inconsistency in route running:** His route breaks are inconsistent, and he needs to improve his weight transfer to generate effective deceleration.\n* **Not an elite athlete:** While tough and capable, he lacks elite athletic traits that would separate him as a top-tier receiving threat.\n* **Limited box score impact:** He's unlikely to be a high-volume receiver, meaning his contributions will be less about flashy stats and more about consistent reliability.\n\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided comparison spectrum (Colt Lyerla - Noah Gray - X) suggests a range of potential outcomes.  \n\n* **Colt Lyerla:** Represents a high-ceiling, but high-risk comparison.  Lyerla possessed exceptional athleticism and potential but was hampered by off-field issues.  This comparison suggests Neville *could* have a high impact if he overcomes challenges.\n\n* **Noah Gray:** This is a more likely and realistic comparison.  Gray is a solid, dependable tight end known for his blocking skills and reliability as a receiver, though not a high-volume target. This suggests Neville will likely fill a similar role as a solid backup and special teamer.\n\n\nThe \"X\" suggests an unknown factor, representing the possibility of an unpredictable development trajectory.  Neville's unique durability story and determined play style add to the variability of projecting his future.  He could develop into something greater, but a reliable backup/special teamer seems most probable given his current skillset.\n"

If he does, there’s potential for him to develop into a contributor in \nshort-yardage scenarios.  \n\n \n81 \nReleases: Latu has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot and his arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee. When he begins his release there’s a slight sink into his stance, and he rolls off his front foot without wasted motion.  \nLatu uses a wipe at the top of his stem against off-coverage with the defender shoots his hands. He uses a two-quick release at the \ntop of his stem against off-coverage—sometimes selling the idea that he’s about to stalk block. In the same scenario, Latu also uses \na double up.  \nHe has an effective double swat as his counter to a stick. From a three-point stance, Latu has a violent shed counter to a defender’s \nhands. He can swim downfield and swim through a turn inside.  \nNone of the footwork has the patient-but-sudden artistry with pacing to bait the coverage effectively.  \nSeparation: Latu has the speed to separate from all but the speediest linebackers. If he’s target downfield, he wins more with his \nheight, length, and size than his speed. \nRoute Stems: Latu will widen a stem to influence a linebacker to slide outside and set up a break inside.  \nRoute Setups: This is an area where Latu can acquire skill.  \nRoute Breaks: Latu can punch is boundary-side arm to snap his breaks back to the quarterback. He does this well on TE screens. \nHis speed turns lack great pace and suddenness, but with the shorter turns he can execute flat drive and line steps.  \nWhen Latu’s first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work to an open spot and settle for the quarterback.  \nZone Routes: Latu identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. He must wait until he has \npassed the buzz/rollover defender before he shows his eyes to the quarterback. He has shown he can do this, but he has lapses.  \nLatu has given the quarterback the indication that he’s open when the linebacker is in great position to drop and undercut the target. \nLatu influenced an interception against Michigan because of this.  \nRoute Boundary: Latu is aware of the boundary and he toe-taps as he catches out-breaking routes.  \nPass Tracking: Latu tracks targets over his shoulder and he can use overhand position to catch them at the earliest point of arrival.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Latu can turn behind his break path to catch targets at his back hip. He traps targets to his stomach with \nunderhand attack.  \nLatu clap-attacks with overhand position at his chest on shallow-breaking routes. Latu can high point over his shoulder up the seam.  \nPosition: I didn’t see Latu earn targets where he had to create position between himself and the defender to win the ball. \nFocus: Latu has the hand strength to attack the ball with overhand technique away from his frame against tight coverage at his back \nthat makes contact at his back and swats at the ball as Latu makes the initial catch. He can take hard contact to his hip and back as \nhe catches targets.  \nLatu can high point over his shoulder up the seam and withstand hard contact to his chest and pads from the safety over the top—\neven run through the defender for additional yardage.  \nTransitions: Latu catches and pierces and he obeys the direction of the ball.  \nElusiveness: Latu spins off contact in the open field.  \nVision: Latu is a decisive runner with blockers ahead of him on TE screens. He’ll also press blockers and get tight to the block before \nmaking his cut off the blocker’s leverage.  \nPower: Latu drops his pads into oncoming shots and can limit the impact of the hit to his legs. He wards off reaches to his frame \nwith his stiff arm. He pulls through wraps and forces gang-tackling in the secondary. He can push/pull multiple defenders for 5-10 \nyards.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He wins direct collisions with safeties in the open field. He stalemates linebackers.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off shots to his thighs and knees from a linebacker working across the field to cut him. \nHe has an effective balance-touch to maintain his footing and continue forward. He takes hard contact to his hip from a cornerback \nwith momentum.  \n\n \n82 \nBall Security: Latu carries the ball close to his chest. He can take some contact to the ball and ball-carrying arm. His elbow is loose \nfrom his side. He uses his boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: With Man Over Me assignments, Latu earns a squat and square stance and shuffles his feet well to move laterally. He can \nanchor his stance enough to prevent anything more than a minor push against smaller edge defenders.  \nHe’s skilled and keeping his hands tight so he’s striking the chest of the opponent. If he doesn’t get his hands inside, he works \nquickly to remedy that. He redirects well enough to take the opponent in the direction the opponent wants to go but farther than \ndesired.  \nWhen executing wind backs, Latu lowers his shoulder and aims for the chest of the edge defender, striking with the pad or the \nforearm. As the season progressed, Latu showed he could deliver a tight uppercut punch with hip roll on wind back against a \ndefensive end.  \nHe’ll also wind back with a cut block. He works across the frame of the opponent, but not fully across. He’s also too high to shoot \nthrough the opponent without meeting the opponent’s forearm or hands. To his credit, Latu can keep his feet to move with the \ndefender and wall him off when this happens.  \nThere are other cut block attempts on wind backs where he begins his shoot too early and he’s too high, which allows the defender \nto use his hands to defend his frame from the block. Then, there are other wind back reps where he doesn’t take the optimal angle \nto get across the defender and in his attempts to shoot through the opponent, Latu only grazes one leg with his frame.  \nLatu lacks a good feel for where and when to attack with cut blocks on wind backs.  \nWhen lead blocking, Latu earns a square and squat stance, keeps his elbows tight, and aims for the defender’s chest. He can have \nmore success if he attacks the shoulder of the defender that can turn the opponent away from the designed path of the running play.  \nRight now, he’s giving the defender quick opportunities to strike, shed, and shoot the gap. When executing wind backs, Latu will \nattack the inside shoulder and have more success with sustaining the block. He also does well with the force player to his side of the \nfield. He can take the outside shoulder and turn the opponent into the line to seal the edge for his runner.  \nLatu transitions effectively from route runner to blocker, tilting into the defensive back after forcing the coverage to get depth from \nthe play design.  \nAs a pass protector, Latu has an effective one-arm technique as the defender gets wide and he moves his feet well enough to \nredirect with the defender working back to the inside. He can work inside with the tackle on a double team and peel outside to pick \nup a delayed edge blitz. \nAs a run blocker, he can combo block with a double team inside and peel to the linebacker with a square position and strike.  \nDurability: Fractured fibula against UNLV in October 2023. He had a knee injury in August of 2024 but only missed a scrimmage. \nPlayed 11 of 12 games in 2021 as a freshman. Played 20 games in his first two years of college football.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPress and cut and contact balance \n• \nHighlights vs. Michigan 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n83",
        "analysis": "Keleki Latu is a TE prospect with a high ceiling but needs refinement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Athleticism:**  At 6'7\", 244 lbs, Latu possesses impressive size and displays the speed to separate from linebackers. His length and height are significant advantages in contested catches.\n* **Blocking Prowess:**  His strongest asset is his blocking ability. He's a good striker, effectively earning optimal position as an inline blocker and excelling in man-over-me assignments.  He shows potential as a lead blocker and pass protector, although technique needs improvement.\n* **Catch Radius and Hands:** He possesses a large catch radius and generally reliable hands, evidenced by a high percentage of pinpoint catches, although he does occasionally \"clap-attack\" targets.  He's shown the ability to high-point the ball and make catches in traffic.\n* **Run After Catch:** When he builds momentum, he's a powerful runner and can gain significant yardage after the catch.  He shows good balance and power in breaking tackles.\n* **Physicality:** He's not afraid of contact and consistently wins collisions against safeties and stalemates linebackers.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route Running:** While he can separate, his route running needs significant improvement. He lacks the artistry and pacing to consistently create separation against top-level coverage. His route setups and breaks require refinement.  He sometimes gives the quarterback misleading indications of his openness.\n* **Blocking Technique:**  Although powerful, his blocking technique, particularly wind-back and cut blocking, needs work. He lacks timing and feel in these areas, resulting in missed opportunities.  Improvement in angle knowledge is crucial.\n* **Weight:**  Adding 15-20 pounds of muscle could significantly enhance his contributions in short-yardage situations.\n* **Consistency:** While he shows flashes of brilliance, consistency is key to his development. He needs to improve his decision-making on routes and his execution on blocks.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** C.J. Fiedorowicz is a reasonable comparison, highlighting Latu's potential as a strong blocker with decent receiving skills. However, Fiedorowicz was a more polished route runner coming out of college.  Latu needs development to reach that level.  Another comparison might be a less refined version of a player like  Darren Waller (before his peak) – strong size and athleticism, but relying more on physicality initially than refined route running.\n\n\n**Overall:** Latu is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His physical tools and blocking ability are evident, but his route running and blocking technique need significant refinement.  He projects as a potential contributor in a limited role, but reaching starter status depends heavily on his development.  Teams will need to be patient and invest in his coaching.\n"

He’s a quick athlete, but his lack of refined footwork gets in the way of him playing as explosively \nas he could against man-to-man coverage.  \nWhen facing zone coverage, Conyers has room to operate. It’s in this climate where Conyers is effective with route setups and \nbreaks that are common to zone.  \nConyers is rugged at the catch point and a good rebounder who times his flights for the target and earns position on his opponents. \nHe has lapses with awkward target placements that lead to clap-attacking the ball and/or using attacks that lack uniformity with his \nhands.  \n\n \n84 \nConyers also uses his size effectively after the catch. He also has some feel for setting up blocks. As a blocker, Conyers can throw a \npunch with good technique and control his opponent. Yet, he also has frequent lapses where he overextends into contact and loses \nthe battle early.  \nOverall, Conyers has four areas where he could clean up his game:  \n• \nRelease footwork \n• \nDeveloping hard breaks with good weight drop against man-to-man coverage \n• \nLimiting lapses with attacking the ball  \n• \nCurtailing his overextensions as a blocker \n \nIf he can improve 2-3 of these areas, he could have similar promise as the tight ends in the second tier of the RSP’s rankings. He \nmay be near the bottom of the third tier, but he has the most realistic path to climb into the second tier and have a meaningful \ncareer with legitimate receiving production.  \nIf he can improve all four of these areas, he could become a starter with weekly statistical value.  \nReleases: Conyers has a staggered stance when detached from the line of scrimmage. His stance is a little too wide for his footwork \noff the line. His weight distribution is 80/20 in favor of his front leg. His hands rest at either side of his front knee.  \nWhen he begins his release, Conyers rolls off his front foot without wasted motion. His pads are over his knees.   \nHe uses a read step off the line—stepping backward rather than outside and forward. This step could also be wasted movement and \ninterpreted as an extra step rather than a read step. There are reps it looks like a functional read step and other moments where it \nlooks like wasted motion.  \nConyers counters the hands of coverage with the reduction of his shoulder. He also counters with a wipe or combines a read step or \ntwo-quick with a wipe. \nSeparation: Conyers has enough acceleration to work to the corner to the far sideline and turn the corner past box defenders and \nsome defensive backs.  \nRoute Stems: He attacks outside leverage with the widening of a stem. He dives inside against inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Conyers delivers a peek against off coverage that includes a hard stick. Conyers’ peek also includes turning his torso \noutside along with his head and eyes.  \nRoute Breaks: With shallow speed turns, Conyers can deliver flat drive and line steps. He earns good snap at the top of his stem for \nhis speed turns. He gets his head around early and runs out the break.  \nZone Routes: Conyers identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. If a trailing zone \ndefender blocks the open lane of that first break, Conyers immediately shuffles his feet with his frame in a friendly position to the \nquarterback so he’s in an open throwing lane.  \nWhen working across zones, he’ll tempo his break. He doesn’t show his eyes until he has cleared the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Conyers is aware of the boundary when performing jump-up-and-through high points for the ball against tight \ncoverage.  \nPass Tracking: Conyers can track the ball over his shoulder. He clap-attacks with underhand technique.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Conyers attacks targets at his numbers with overhand position. He extends away from his frame for the ball \nbut he has lapses with clap-attacks as well as attacks that aren’t uniform.   \nConyers can dig out low throws with a defender on his back. He attacks the ball at the earliest point with targets arriving at the \nnumbers.  \nPosition: Conyers can jump up and through for an underthrown target. He also has an effective pull-back and he’ll embrace the fall. \nHe can do better to embrace the fall with more targets.  \nFocus: Conyers can high point with a defender in tight coverage to his back and side. He can take contact to his back and chest. He \nalso digs out low throws against tight coverage.  \nTransitions: Conyers will catch and pierce downhill.  \n\n \n85 \nElusiveness: Conyers will attempt to spin away from pursuit after establishing contact with a stiff arm. He only needs two small \ntransition steps to get downhill to turn the short corner inside a force defender. He can hurdle low shots in the open field.  \nVision: Conyers runs to open space and he can make defenders miss or mitigate contact with them in one-on-one situations. He’s \naware of pursuit at the catch point to work away from it as he transitions.  \nHe presses and cuts back against unblocked defenders, setting up blocks to the backside. He works toward the boundary where the \ngame script demands.  \nPower: Conyers has a stiff arm to ward off reaches to his upper body. He’ll drop his pads into contact and keep his feet moving. He \ncan pull through reaches to his thighs.  \nDirect Contact Balance: I didn’t see any direct collisions.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Conyers bounces off indirect shots from safeties when he has downhill momentum in the open field.  \nBall Security: Conyers tucks the ball under his right arm even when catching a target with a break taking him outside the left hash \nand with pursuit on his right side. He will switch the ball to his left arm as soon as he can. He can take contact to the ball, carrying it \nhigh to his chest but with the elbow lose from his side.  \nBlocking: When facing linebackers at the line, he can pin a slanting linebacker inside with an uppercut and tight position to the \nopponent’s frame. In the open field, he’ll take the outside shoulder of a cornerback and turn the opponent to the boundary.  \nConyers moves well to the perimeter as a lead blocker from the backside wing working to the frontside edge. He earns the outside \nshoulder of the linebacker or safety and keeps his feet moving. When the defender turns to reach for the runner, Conyer’s footwork \nand position helps him pancake the opponent.  \nConyers delivers hard strikes with his forearm and shoulder as a lead blocker double-teaming a linebacker shooting the gap into an \ninterior crease. As a lead blocker to the edge, he’ll sell out for his runner and extend fully to the inside shoulder of a force player to \nturn the defender out of the rushing lane.  \nAs a puller on Counter, Conyers will identify backside pursuit at the second or third level and earn the depth downhill to attack and \nseal that defender inside.  \nAs a stalk blocker or lead blocker, Conyers earns a squat and square position with a wide stance that’s balanced. When on the move \nas a lead blocker, Conyers is adept and working his hands into position after the first contact and getting into the defender’s body, \nwhich often leads to Conyers knocking the defender off balance.  \nWhen working across the formation as a wind-back blocker, Conyers can roll through the hips after making contact, but he’s not \nstriking with an uppercut motion as much as he’s overextending into the opponent and then rolling the hips.  \nWhen working downfield as a receiver, Conyers will transition as a blocker after running off the defender. He tilts into the opponent \nwith good position and keeps his feet moving.  \nAs a pass protect from the wing, Conyers identifies A-Gap pressure and works deep into the pocket to the meet the linebacker.  \nConyers can work across the formation and cut edge pursuit. His timing is good. He works across the defender with good height and \nshoots through the opponent.  \nDurability: Broken foot sometime between 2023 season and spring of 2024. Team officials couldn’t pinpoint when the injury \nhappened. He missed spring practices in 2024.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Conyers may not be a developmental project by NFL standards, but for fantasy standards it will \nqualify. If he improves 2-3 of the areas listed, Conyers could become a bye-week option who can earn value against zone defenses \nwhen it’s a good matchup. If he improves all four, he could become a weekly starter with big-play potential.  \n \nIf you’re in a 1.5 PPR format with deep rosters, Conyers is worth a late pick for stashing on a practice squad for a year or two. \nMonitor from afar in other formats.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nPeek, stick, extension, and clap-attack with no embracing of the fall \n• \nJump up and through, pull-back, embrace the fall \n• \nClap-attacking targets \n• \nJalin Conyers 2024 Highlights \n• \nJalin Conyers Career Highlights \n\n \n86",
        "analysis": "Jalin Conyers is a tight end prospect with a high ceiling but needs refinement to reach his full potential.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Ball Winning Ability:**  Conyers excels at winning contested catches, showing strength and a knack for timing his jumps to secure the ball, even in tight coverage. He's effective at high-pointing the ball and digging out low throws.  He's also strong after the catch, using his size and power to break tackles.\n* **Zone Coverage Proficiency:** He demonstrates good route-running skills and understanding of zone coverages, allowing him to find open spaces and create separation. His route setups and breaks are effective against zone defenses.\n* **Blocking Potential:** He shows flashes of good blocking technique, particularly with his punch and control.  He can effectively seal off defenders and create running lanes.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:** Refining his footwork and developing harder breaks against man coverage could unlock more explosive plays.  His current footwork occasionally hinders his explosiveness.\n* **Consistent Catch Technique:**  He needs to eliminate inconsistent hand placement and clap-attacking the ball, which leads to drops.  Improving his hand usage and embracing the fall consistently will improve his catch rate.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** While he possesses potential as a blocker, he needs to reduce overextensions that lead to him losing battles early.  Greater consistency in his blocking technique is key.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Footwork/Man Coverage:** His footwork needs significant improvement to consistently create separation against man-to-man coverage.\n* **Hand Usage/Ball Security:**  Inconsistent hand technique and occasional lapses in ball security are areas requiring improvement.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** He demonstrates inconsistency in his blocking, frequently overextending and losing leverage.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The comparison spectrum of Alge Crumpler to Dwayne Allen suggests a player with potential as a receiving and blocking tight end, but perhaps lacking the elite athleticism of top-tier prospects.  Crumpler was a solid all-around tight end with reliable hands, and Allen was a more balanced player with both receiving and blocking ability, although neither were known for exceptional athleticism.  Conyers' profile aligns with this range, leaning more toward the Allen archetype given his blocking potential.  He needs significant improvement to reach the higher end of that spectrum.\n"

Get Ferguson on a well-blocked screen or out in space, and he’ll rumble up to full speed and generate \nchunk plays. Work Ferguson up the seam on a well-devised play-action pass and he will track the ball over his shoulder or have time \nto fully turn to the ball and make the catch.  \n \nThere’s value in players who can perform these scenarios, but if that’s all there is, that value is too limited. At best, it translates to \nboom-bust production. \n \n\n \n87 \nFerugson has these skills, but his short-area quickness and bend aren’t on par with the linear athletic ability. He’s at a disadvantage \nfor a lot of baseline skills required of NFL tight ends:  \n \n• \nWinning releases against tight coverage at the line. \n• \nSetting up tight man-to-man coverage during his stems. \n• \nWinning breaks against man-to-man. \n• \nMaking defenders miss in the open field.  \n• \nRedirecting his position against defenders as a run blocker.  \n \nThose are a lot of core skills required of tight ends in the NFL. \n \nAs is the case with many stiff athletes whose job is to catch the ball, Ferguson has a radius of mobility with his upper body that helps \nhim adjust to the ball as long as extensive footwork or lower-body bend is involved in the process. He wins back-shoulder targets \nand makes late adjustments to errant throws when the lower body isn’t involved, but the level of difficulty with these targets is about \nto rise a notch.  \n \nMike Gesicki is a high-end version of this linear athlete at the position. The difference between Gesicki and Ferguson is that Gesicki \ncatches the ball with strong technique, and Ferguson has a penchant for clap-attacking targets when required to extend his arms and \nbody to the ball.  \n \nThe segment of the public that has only seen Ferguson’s highlight packages will see impressive catches, including adjustments while \nairborne against contact. It’s stuff that might lead you to believe Ferguson belongs in the top two tiers of this tight end class.  \n \nA more detailed examination of Ferguson reveals that he drops a lot more passes in these scenarios than he catches. A lack of \ntechnique and focus are the issues. While the technique is addressable for most, it could prove more complicated for Ferguson’s \nlinear game.  \n \nThis was the case for Michael Egnew, a third-round pick for Miami in 2012 whose linear game was a legitimate concern. Like Egnew, \nFerguson will also discover that blocking in the NFL is a massive jump in skill.  \n \nFerguson overextends against opponents on a regular basis as an inline blocker. As a result, he’s never close enough to assignment \nto effectively redirect or make a capable second effort.  \nFerguson lacks effective change-of-direction quickness so his reaction to the first move gives the defender an easy countermove \nbecause Ferguson isn’t quick enough to redirect and he’s out of position. He also has difficulty making adjustments to reach his \nassignments as a lead blocker.  \nIf Ferguson can work through his issues as pass catcher, he could emerge as a situational receiving threat in a passing offense that \ncan find favorable mismatches thanks to the strength of its offensive nucleus. That’s a big if.  \n \nTechnically, Ferguson could have graded out in the starter tier as a route runner if going by the letter of the criteria. Projecting to the \nNFL is more important than checking boxes of what a player does in college. Ferguson’s linear athletic ability inhibits his ability to \nperform releases and breaks effectively at the next level and limits his range opportunities as a receiver.  \n \nIf I’m incorrect about Ferguson in this respect, I would have had him 11th on my TE board instead of 16th and closer to the top end of \nthe contributor tier instead of near the bottom range.   \n \nReleases: Ferguson has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg when he’s in a detached alignment \nfrom the offensive line. His arms hang at either side of his knee.  \nWhen Ferguson begins his release, he leans forward and rolls off the front foot. There are reps without wasted motion—usually when \nfacing deep zone cushions.  \nAgainst shallow cushions, Ferguson uses a two-quick release before rolling off the front foot, but the steps are so small that they \nseem more like wasted motion than a cogent release move designed to manipulate the defender.  \nAgainst an open zone, Ferguson sinks into this stance and leans forward but he takes a small step with his front foot rather than \nrolling off it.  \nHis stick outside and wipe counter is effective against outside-shade defenders playing off coverage. Ferguson also counters with a \nswat-swim combo.  \n\n \n88 \nWhen split wide, Ferguson has delivered a feet-switch with a wipe counter to work inside. His double up has effective patience and \nsuddenness against coverage playing a three-yard cushion. He has a forceful throw-by counter.  \nFerguson also uses a two-quick, but the move lacks the artistry it needs to be effective.  \nHe uses a double-swat at the top of his stems to work outside or inside coverage over the top. He reduces his shoulder from off-\ncoverage defenders.  \nSeparation: Ferguson is a long strider who can earn separation up the intermediate seam against zone coverage that bites on play \naction. He may lack short-area agility/quickness, but he builds speed and can generate separation against box defenders and some \nsafeties when he earns a long enough runway.  \nRoute Stems: Ferguson will dive inside to attack inside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: One of the most effective ways to use Ferguson as a receiver is with delayed releases where he blocks down and \nallows the defender to work past him after the initial interaction at the line.  \nFerguson will dive inside to attack inside leverage but he doesn’t straighten out enough to sell the safety over the top of that shallow \ndefender on the idea of a vertical route. If he did, Ferguson would have an effective stair-step.  \nFerguson has an effective inset against trail coverage when working up the seam and setting up an out-breaking route.  \nRoute Breaks: Ferguson has a long break step and flat drive and line steps on speed turns. He doesn’t snap the turn enough \nagainst tight coverage. He attempts to punch and turn, which limits his reaction time to quick targets out of the break. This can \nmake him late to attack the ball.  \nFerguson is also a beat late to turn his head to the quarterback and this can also lead to complications with targets.  \nHard breaks aren’t fluid. He has a three-step break but the weight bend comes after the three-step deceleration and it’s not a \nsudden bend.  \nWhen his first route breaking across the field doesn’t earn a target, he will work to an open spot with his quarterback.  \nZone Routes: Ferguson identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the open zone. He turns \nhis head when he has cleared the buzz/rollover defender. He’ll also settle into the open area on routes breaking to the quarterback. \nWhen breaking back to the quarterback, he finishes with a friendly target position for the passer.  \nRoute Boundary: He’s aware of the boundary when making back-shoulder plays.  \nPass Tracking: He can track the ball over his shoulder and back shoulder.   \nHands/Catch Radius: Ferguson can turn behind his break path and catch the target away from his numbers with overhand \nposition. He can also work back shoulder while falling to the ground to catch a low-and-away target on a vertical break near the \nboundary.  \nWhen extending wide of his frame with an overhand attack, Ferguson is prone to clap-attacking that has led to dropped passes. \nCompounding matters, Ferguson lacks focus when there’s the flash of a defender across his sightline as he attacks a target.  \nWhen he isn’t dropping the ball, eh can extend wide and at knee-height to clap-catch the back of the ball and pull it to his frame. He \ndigs out low throws in front of his break path but uses high-low attack.  \nPosition: Ferguson can embrace the fall.  \nFocus: Ferguson earns out-breaking targets with tight coverage wrapping his back. He also earns targets across the middle with a \ndefending coming from the opposite path to swat at the ball or strike Feguson’s chest with his arm.  \nHe can high-point away from his frame and take shots to his chest.  \nHe drops more contested targets than he catches and it’s a combination of him lacking focus and sound attack technique.  \nTransitions: Ferguson obeys the direction of the ball when catching a target outside the numbers and within a few yards of the \nboundary. He will catch and pierce.  \n\n \n89 \nElusiveness: Ferguson is not effective with stop-start movement but when he has room to build speed, he has just enough \ncurvilinear speed bend around downhill pursuit with minimal slowing of his pace. He can make defenders miss with this side \nstepping.   \nFerguson will spin off glancing shots to his frame when another defender has him wrapped low. He needs 3-4 steps to cut back inside \nand downhill from a perimeter approach.  \nVision: Ferguson sees the field well and sets up pursuit over the top with presses downhill and small dips away from them. He’s \npatient, decisive, and doesn’t take unnecessary risks. He has been successful with cutbacks against 2-3 unblocked defenders after he \npressed them to the outside.  \nPower: Ferguson has an effective stiff arm to ward off reaches to his frame. He can pull through reaches to his lower legs. He \nfinishes runs with his pads and keeps his feet moving when wrapped high.  \nHe can pull through wraps to his torse from off-ball linebackers and bounce off a hit from a defensive back during the same play.  \nDirect Contact Balance: Ferguson can run over cornerbacks, forcing them to wrap up. He’ll stalemate an off-ball linebacker in the \nhole.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Ferguson has an effective balance-touch to regain his balance. He bounces off glancing shots to his \nframe from safeties and linebackers.  \nBall Security: Ferguson carries the ball within proximity of his chest, but not high enough to say it’s close. His elbow is tight to his \nframe unless forced to make dynamic movements to work through or away from contact. At that point, the elbow flies free of his \nside.  \nBlocking: As an inline blocker, Ferguson closes the gap between himself and the defender, his hands are tight when they attack the \ndefender, and his elbows are bent. Ferguson aims for the inside shoulder of his edge assignments so he can turn the defender \noutside, moving his feet effectively to make this happen.  \nHe overextends early on a regular basis as an inline blocker. As a result, he’s never close enough to assignment to effectively \nredirect or make a capable second effort.  \nFerguson has a square and squat stance as a stalk blocker. He breaks down within two yards of the opponent and waits for the \ndefender to declare his position. However, Ferguson lacks effective change-of-direction quickness so his reaction to the first move \ngives the defender an easy countermove because Ferguson isn’t quick enough to redirect and he’s out of position.  \nAs a combo blocker, Ferguson can deliver a hard shot with his pads into the chest of the linebacker. He overextends into the \ncollision, but when he earns clean contact, the hit is substantial. Ferguson can work his hands into the body of the defender and turn \nthem inside or outside.  \nWhen lead blocking at the edge on plays where he’s sent in motion to the play side while the ball is snapped, Ferguson lacks the \nagility to bend inside and seal the linebacker. He has to run past that defender and go after the safety downhill, hoping that the \nrunning back can get outside the linebacker into the flat.   \nWhen Ferguson gets his hands on a linebacker or safety and has his hips aligned with the target, he can lock on to the defender and \ngenerate a significant push downhill.  \nAt the line of scrimmage, Ferguson is effective against linebackers and some defensive ends.  \nWhen attempting to cut block edge defenders on the backside of runs, Ferguson’s timing is good. So is the height of the cut and \nworking across the frame of the opponent. Ferguson tips off his blocks because he drops his head and can’t see what he’s hitting. He \nalso doesn’t shoot through the contact.  \nFerguson’s tip-offs allow defenders to use their hands to work around the attempt.  \nDurability: Other than surgery for appendicitis that cost him a week in 2024, he’s had no serious injuries or missed time.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: A highlight package star who could get drafted too early in most leagues because there’s a \nwidespread lack of knowledge about the limitations of linear athletes in a non-linear sport.  \n \nFor Ferguson’s sake, I hope I’m wrong about his potential for development, but I’ll need to see proof before I try to buy into him \nlater in his career. \n \nI’m not sure there’s a scenario where I can recommend drafting Ferguson.  \n\n \n90 \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nLong-developing misdirection play with a big runway downhill \n• \nBack-shoulder dig-out near boundary \n• \nOverextension as a run blocker \n• \nClap-attacking, stiff arm in open field \n• \nTelegraphed cut block \n• \nClap-drop in tight zone triangle \n• \nDouble up, throw-by, inset, digs out low throw \n• \nTerrance Ferguson Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n91",
        "analysis": "Terrance Ferguson is a TE prospect with a TE16 ranking.  His profile reveals a player with significant athletic upside but considerable technical flaws that limit his NFL potential.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Linear Speed and Vertical Jump:** Ferguson possesses impressive straight-line speed and a strong vertical leap, enabling him to excel on deep routes and high-point the ball.  He can create separation downfield, especially when given a long runway.\n* **Back-Shoulder Catches:**  He demonstrates an ability to make catches away from his body, particularly on back-shoulder throws.\n* **Pass Tracking:** He can effectively track the ball over his shoulder.\n* **Stiff Arm:**  He possesses a useful stiff arm to break tackles in the open field.\n* **Power:** Shows some ability to run over defenders.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:**  His linear athleticism is a double-edged sword. While it helps him on deep routes, it hinders his ability to create separation with quick cuts and sharp breaks.  Improving his route running technique is crucial.\n* **Blocking Technique:**  He severely struggles with blocking, consistently overextending and failing to effectively engage defenders. This needs significant improvement to be an NFL-level contributor.\n* **Hand Technique:** His \"clap-attacking\" style of catching, while occasionally effective, leads to many drops. Refinement of his hand technique is paramount.\n* **Focus and Concentration:** He lacks focus, leading to dropped passes, especially in contested situations.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Short-Area Quickness and Agility:**  His lack of agility and short-area quickness significantly hampers his ability to win releases against tight coverage, make sharp cuts, and make defenders miss in the open field.\n* **Blocking:** Consistently poor blocking technique makes him a liability in this area.\n* **Catch Consistency:**  High drop rate, especially on contested catches, despite his ability to make impressive catches in specific situations.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report compares Ferguson to a spectrum of players, highlighting both the potential and the risk:\n\n* **High-End Comparison (Mike Gesicki):** Gesicki is presented as a high-end example of a linear athlete succeeding at the TE position. However, the key difference is Gesicki's superior catching technique.\n* **Mid-Range Comparison (Ed Dickson):** Dickson is not explicitly detailed as a comparison, but implied as a potential outcome if Ferguson improves his weaknesses.\n* **Low-End Comparison (Michael Egnew):** Egnew serves as a cautionary tale – a player with similar linear athleticism and technical flaws who ultimately failed to translate his college success to the NFL.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nFerguson possesses the raw athleticism to potentially be a contributor in the NFL, but his technical limitations, particularly in route running and blocking, significantly lower his ceiling.  He's a boom-or-bust prospect whose success hinges on significant improvements in his technique and focus.  His draft position should reflect the high risk involved.\n"

Even as an H-Back. \nGadsden has a small repertoire as a route runner that’s restricted to zone coverage. There’s zero craft with man-to-man coverage.  \nAt the catch point, Gadsden wins the ball against tight coverage and attacks the ball early. He has lapses with clap-attacks when \nhigh pointing. He can take hits to earn the ball.  \n\n \n92 \nAfter the catch, Gadsden has efficient moves to create space but he lacks dynamic athletic ability to create large gains. He’ll work \nthrough reaches and have success against some defensive backs.  \nGadsden could become a viable producer in another league as a big slot receiver, but he’s likely a reserve or special teams option in \nthe NFL.  \nReleases: Gadsden has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee.  \nGadsden leans downhill to begin his release, getting his pads over his knees. He doesn’t sink into his stance, but he rolls off his front \nfoot without wasted motion. Gadsden has lapses where he takes a small step with his front foot instead of rolling off it.  \nGadsden has a two-quick release. He counters with a wipe. He has an effective double up at the top of his stem against off-coverage \nto attack outside leverage and break inside.  \nGadsden reduces the shoulder from off-coverage when the defender attempts to put his hands on the receiver. He can also attack \nwith a wipe and duck under the defender to get inside. He has a shed against inside leverage at the top of stems for routes that \nbreak outside.  \nHis read step can be more effective if he introduces some artistry with pacing into the mix. He uses a lean-in to set up breaks inside.  \nHe uses a feet-switch to steal a release in the running game. He combines a read step with a two-quick against off-coverage to set \nup an out-breaking route.   \nGadsden has an effective blade release – a shoulder reduction and shed combination.  \nSeparation: Gadsen can challenge safeties with his speed, but he’s more of a big and slow receiver trying to be tight end than a \nnatural tight end with the speed of a receiver.  \nRoute Stems: Gadsden will widen a stem to attack outside leverage and set up a stop route between that defender and a linebacker \nat the same depth.  \nRoute Setups: He didn’t show any setups as a route runner and for a former receiver that’s disappointing.  \nRoute Breaks: Gadsden turns back to the quarterback have snap. He earns a friendly position to the quarterback. With speed turns, \nGadsden earns flat drive and line steps.  \nGadsden has a drop-and-pop break, but the weight drop can be deeper.  \nZone Routes: Gadsden identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When his break doesn’t \nearn a target, Gadsden works back to the quarterback or to an open area.  \nGadsden tempos his breaks across the open zone. He doesn’t show his eyes until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Gadsden is aware of the boundary, and he can high-point facing the quarterback while dragging his feet inbounds \nwhile backing his way to the sideline.  \nPass Tracking: Gadsden tracks targets over his shoulder with overhand position on shallow targets. He tracks the ball over his head \nwith full extension wide of his frame but in stride without leaving his feet with a defender tight to him.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Gadsden uses underhand attack for targets at his waist or back hip. He attacks targets at the numbers with \noverhand position. He can attack targets at the earliest point of arrival when arriving on his numbers.  \nGadsden clap-attacks targets when using overhand position and loses control of the ball. When facing tight coverage or contact, the \ncontact can lead to Gadsden dropping the ball.  \nGadsden high-points without clap-attacking. \nPosition: He can embrace the fall with a defender on his back. He has a timely pull-back against tight trail coverage on back-\nshoulder targets and he’ll embrace the fall through the rap of the defender.  \nFocus: Gadsden takes hits to his back while catching targets—including high points. Gadsden can take swats and other contact to \nhis hands and chest as he catches the ball.  \n\n \n93 \nTransitions: Gadsden catches and pierces downhill with targets facing the quarterback. It helps him pull through initial contact from \ncoverage after making the catch.  \nElusiveness: Gadsden delivers an effective stick to freeze pursuit as he’s working across the middle. He can spin away from pursuit.  \nVision: Gadsden is a straight-line runner who changes direction as a reaction to what’s in front of him more often than him setting \nup what might unfold ahead.  \nPower: Gadsden uses his stiff arm to swat away reaches to his frame in the open field. He pulls through reaches to his torso and \nwaist. He can pull through multiple reaches, but that’s the extent of his power. He finishes with pad level that helps him lean forward \nthrough contact in the open field.  \nDirect Contact Balance: I didn’t see instances of him winning direct collisions.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Gadsden bounces off indirect glancing shots to his frame from safeties.  \nBall Security: Gadsden tucks the ball under his sideline arm after the catch. He carries the ball high to his chest and tight to his \nframe when he knows trail coverage is bearing down on him. He can take contact to the ball.  \nBlocking: Gadsden remains a wide receiver in skill set as a blocker and it shows when he’s asked to do the work of a tight ends. He \nlacks the bend, stance, knowledge of angles, use of hands, and size for his new position. The bend and stance have gradually \nimproved over the course of the 2024 season when facing smaller defenders at the line of scrimmage.  \nGadsden gets his hands tight and aims for the defender’s chest on a double team. His stance isn’t wide enough to be balanced. He’s \nprone to locking his arms out. He must work on narrowing the distance between himself and the assignment.  \nWhen lead blocking from the wing with a pull to an interior gap, Gadsden drops his head and leads with a shoulder. He can’t see \nwhat he’s trying to hit and linebackers easily avoid him.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Gadsden works within a few yards of the high safety but his stance lacks width—he’s not prepared for contact. \nWhen he earns contact facing downhill, he keeps his feet moving and generates ap ush against smaller defensive backs.  \nGadsden keeps his head on a swivel. When a safety from over the top pursues from the backside of a play, Gadsden peels back and \nthrows his shoulder into the chest of the opponent.  \nWhen sliding laterally with a pass rusher, Gadsden’s knees and hips aren’t in a squat position and he overextends. He has difficulty \nkeeping pacing with this position.  \nWhen setting up at the edge as a backside blocker on a run play, he will earn a wide stance. He can anchor and generate a push \nagainst defensive backs and small off-ball linebackers.  \nHe’s a collider with his elbows bent instead of a puncher at this stage of his in-line blocking career.  \nDurability: Gadsden suffered a season-ending foot injury in 2023 (Lisfranc to right foot) that cost him all but two games. He had \ntwo surgeries on the foot – one for screws and the other to remove them. He missed a month in 2021 due to undisclosed injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from far.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nDouble-up, stick, tempos break, YAC \n• \nHigh point vs contact and embraces the fall \n• \nClap-drops \n• \nHigh point, boundary awareness, dragging feet \n• \nOronde Gadsden 2024 Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n94",
        "analysis": "Oronde Gadsden is a 6'5\", 236-pound tight end prospect from Syracuse, ranked TE17 by RSP.  His profile presents a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses, making his NFL future uncertain.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Catch Radius and Contested Catches:** Gadsden possesses a large catch radius and excels at winning jump balls, particularly in tight coverage. He's willing to take hits to secure the reception.\n* **After the Catch (YAC):** He shows efficiency in creating space after the catch, using effective moves to evade defenders, though his athleticism limits his ability to consistently generate big gains.\n* **Route Running (Zone):** He's effective running routes against zone coverages, identifying open areas and working back to the quarterback if his initial break isn't targeted.\n* **High-Pointing:** He demonstrates the ability to high-point the ball effectively without consistently resorting to the less-reliable \"clap-attack\" technique.\n* **Boundary Awareness:**  He shows awareness of the sideline and consistently keeps his feet in bounds while making catches near the boundary.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Blocking:** This is his biggest weakness. He lacks the necessary technique, bend, and strength to be a consistently effective blocker at the tight end position.  Improvement here is crucial for his NFL viability.\n* **Route Running (Man):** His route running is currently limited to zone coverages. Developing the craft to beat man-to-man coverage is essential for NFL success.\n* **Overall Athleticism:** While he can create separation against safeties with his speed, he lacks the dynamic athleticism needed to consistently create significant separation against faster NFL defenders.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Blocking:**  As mentioned above, his blocking skills are severely deficient.\n* **Route Running Variety:**  His route tree is limited, relying heavily on zone concepts.\n* **Clap-Attacking:** Though he can high-point effectively, his reliance on the clap-attack technique leads to dropped passes, particularly under contact.\n* **Durability:** He has a history of injuries, including a significant Lisfranc injury in 2023.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scouting report lists a comparison spectrum of Boo Williams, Grant Calcaterra, and Dedrick Epps. This suggests a player who might be a versatile, big-bodied receiver but lacks the elite athleticism and blocking skills of a top-tier tight end.  He could potentially fill a role as a big slot receiver or H-back in the NFL, but his success hinges on significant improvement in blocking and route running diversity.  The comparison to players like Calcaterra indicates a potential for a limited role if his blocking doesn't improve.  He's likely a long shot to become a starter but may find a niche role on a team.  His ceiling is likely a backup or special teams contributor.\n"

Fairweather is a good athlete with the speed to stretch zones and beat man-to-man \ncoverage. He must develop artistry with footwork and pacing with his releases and setups during stems to become a legitimate \nthreat against man coverage.  \nFairweather gets open working across the shallow zones of the field and between zone defenders at the intermediate boundary. His \nbreaks need additional work for him to become an effective route runner against zone and man coverages.  \nFairweather is a good pass tracker and has many of the tools to win against tight coverage. He must improve his grip stretch, focus, \nand retraction of the ball. He also has lapses with attacking with uniform hands position or the ideal attack type for the trajectory of \nthe target.  \n\n \n95 \nOnce he earns the ball, Fairweather is a patient runner who is aware of pursuit, the sticks, and the boundary. He bounces off \nglancing shots and he can pull through lesser forms of contact.  \nFairweather has good strength for his size. He’s quick and he’s willing at the point of attack. He must learn about angles, footwork, \nand positioning to become a viable H-Back. He’ll have to add 10 pounds to do extensive work at the line of scrimmage.  \nExpect Fairweather’s athletic ability to earn him favor as a potential practice squad option a team hopes to develop.  \nTechnical: He can punt the ball 45-50 yards—something he did in high school.  \nReleases: Fairweather has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of \nhis front leg.  \nFairweather begins his release by sinking into his stance. He rocks off the back foot before rolling off his front foot. This is wasted \nmotion he can address. He has limited reps where he doesn’t rock off the back foot but he takes an unnecessary step with the front \nfoot.  \nFairweather has a three-quick release at the top of his stem against off-coverage playing above him on intermediate routes. He uses \na double up against shallow coverage at the line. None of these moves have artistry with pacing.  \nWhen a defender shoots his hands, Fairweather counters with a shed. He reduces his shoulder to avoid the hands of an off-coverage \ndefender. His stick and wipe is effective.  \nSeparation: Fairweather has the speed up the seam to beat linebackers on vertical routes. He can stack a defender at 15 yards. \nRoute Stems: Fairweather attacks inside leverage with a dive of his stem.  \nRoute Setups: Fairweather must develop setups.  \nRoute Breaks: Fairweather’s drive steps and line steps aren’t flat enough out of his breaks and he drifts downfield on out-breaking \nroutes. His drop and pop breaks need a revamping of footwork so he’s delivering a long break step with weight drop so he can \nmaximize acceleration and deceleration in and out of breaks.  \nFairweather can drop his weight. He does it effectively with whip routes, but he must apply this skill with other breaks. There’s some \nweight drop with his three-step break but it can be deeper. If he incorporated a long break step so he could accelerate into the break \nstep and then drop his weight out of the break step, he could earn more separation.  \nZone Routes: Fairweather identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles in the open area with a friendly target to \nthe quarterback. When working across the field and between zone defenders, Fairweather tempos his breaks and waits to turn his \nhead until he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: Fairweather can make full extension attacks of the ball over his head, tracking it over his shoulder and dragging \nhis feet to insure he remains in bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Fairweather tracks the ball over his head and extends his arms to the highest point without leaving his feet to attack \nthe target in stride.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Fairweather extends away from his frame for the ball and catches it at its earliest window of arrival in front \nof him. He uses overhand attack for targets at chest and helmet-height.  \nFairweather catches targets behind his break path with good extension of his arms. He’s a mobile athlete and he can turn back for \nthe ball, extend his arms below his knees, and dig out a target while still on his feet. He uses a high-low attack that could become \nproblematic in the NFL against tighter coverage.  \nPosition: Fairweather can jump up and through but uses underhand position when he should be high-pointing.  \nFocus: Fairweather can take a solid hit to the back while extending for a target above his head. He can take a hard strike to his back \nas he earns a target wide and behind his break path. He can take a hard shot to his chest at the boundary.  \nFairweather can track the ball over his shoulder and extend past tight coverage to make the catch. I’d like to see him improve his \nhand strength and retraction speed of targets. He has had multiple targets knocked out of his hands after the initial catch. \nTransitions: Fairweather catches and pierces downhill with breaks that leave him facing the quarterback. He obeys the path of the \nball.  \n\n \n96 \nElusiveness: Fairweather has quick stop-start movement. He can bend around pursuit shooting for his feet as he’s working \ndownhill. He has an effective spin to work away from pursuit trying to cut off his path. He only needs two steps to transition downhill \nfrom a perimeter approach.  \nVision: Fairweather is patient with setting up unblocked defenders in the open field. He’s aware of the sticks and the pylon. He \nadjusts his frame to extend for the pylon late in a run.  \nPower: Fairweather can extend 2-3 yards forward through low wraps to get the ball across the first-down marker or pylon. His stiff-\narm wards off reaches to his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He can bounce off a direct shot from a safety. \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots to his hips and back from safeties with a runway downhill.  \nBall Security: Fairweather tucks the ball to his boundary-side arm. The ball is close to his chest but the elbow is loose from his side. \nThis carriage has allowed defenders to wrap their arms around the back of the ball and yank it loose when Fairweather is fighting \nmultiple defenders for yardage.  \nBlocking: Fairweather earns a squat and square stance as a blocker in the second level. He shuffles his feet well enough to move \nlaterally with a wide and balanced stance. He can earn a flat lead to cut off Most Dangerous Man assignments inside.  \nWhen pass protecting as part of a double team with a tackle, Fairweather’s lateral movement helps him wall-off edge defenders who \nonly want to engage in hand fighting from a distance and it encourages the defender to work back to the inside toward the tackle.  \nFairweather is prone to overextending as a run blocker and it limits his punch, leverage, and ability to earn a tighter position on \ndefenders. He also gets cast aside early in an assignment.  \nWhen he can get his hands on a defender with good position—usually as a stalk blocker against defensive backs—Fairweather moves \nhis feet and generates a push. He has had success closing the gap with his head up to handle an edge defender in the short passing \ngame.  \nFairweather can overrun his lead blocking assignments when winding back to the play side tackle from a fullback alignment offset the \nquarterback. It forces him to reach for the linebacker and risk a holding penalty.  \nFairweather has the strength to anchor against smaller edge defenders but lacks the footwork and knowledge of angles to \nconsistently do so. He gets pushed into the quarterback’s lap in scenarios he had the potential to avoid. Defenders with a good one-\narm technique or hand counters can turn the corner on Fairweather or generate a push as they work the corner.  \nFairweather anchors better against smaller edge defenders who try to bull-rush him. He drops his head into the interaction which \nmakes him vulnerable to hand counters from savvy pass rushers.  \nIn the open field as a lead blocker, Fairweather can peel off his front side path to address backside pursuit. He has hesitated about \ndoing so and this can cost him an angle in the NFL. His hands are often too wide against edge defenders in the run and passing \ngame.  \nFairweather must learn to strike. He swats and arm or throws a pad at a defender, but there’s no control or balance with the strike.  \nI’ve only seen Fairweather deliver an uppercut strike in one of three games charted. To his credit, he did it multiple times. When he \ndid, it helped him maintain a balanced stance, sustain his effort, and earn a second strike. He must do this more often and learn to \nroll through the hips with his strike.  \nOn sprint passes, he identifies a blitzing linebacker and shuffles inside to take the defender’s outside shoulder with a hard strike and \nmove the defender well outside the moving pocket.  \nDurability: No significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nTracking, extension, and drags feet at boundary \n• \nDig-out, mobility, YAC, pylon awareness \n• \nRivaldo Fairweather Auburn Highlights \n• \nRivaldo Fairweather FIU Highlights \n \n\n \n97",
        "analysis": "Rivaldo Fairweather is a TE prospect with intriguing athleticism but significant technical flaws.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Athleticism:**  Possesses good speed to stretch the field and beat man coverage, particularly up the seam.  He's also a quick, agile runner after the catch with good vision and the ability to extend for the pylon.  He shows good strength for his size, bouncing off glancing blows and capable of pushing through contact.\n* **Pass Tracking:**  Displays decent ball tracking skills, extending his arms to make catches over his head and even while contorting his body.  He's shown the ability to make catches in tight coverage.\n* **Zone Awareness:**  Effective at finding soft spots in zone coverages and working across the field to get open.  He understands how to time his breaks to avoid defenders.\n* **Blocking Potential (raw):** Shows flashes of potential as a run blocker with a good base and ability to generate some push when he gets his hands on the defender. He can successfully wall off edge rushers in pass protection with lateral movement.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running:**  Needs significant improvement in route running technique. His breaks are inconsistent, often drifting or lacking precision. Developing artistry in his releases and stems is crucial.  He must improve footwork and pacing to consistently create separation against man coverage.\n* **Hand Technique:**  While showing good extension, he needs to improve his grip strength, focus, and ball security. He has a tendency to drop passes and has had catches knocked loose after the initial catch. His hand placement and attack type often aren't ideal for the trajectory of the ball.\n* **Blocking Consistency:**  Needs to refine his blocking technique to become more reliable. His tendency to overextend and poor angles limit his effectiveness.  He needs to learn proper striking technique and leverage. Needs to add weight to be more effective at the line of scrimmage.\n* **Overall Refinement:** His game needs significant coaching to refine his skills and become a more consistent and well-rounded player.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe comparison spectrum (Ja'Tavion Sanders – Greg Dulcich – DeAngelo Peterson) highlights the range of potential outcomes.  He could be a developmental player with upside (Sanders), a solid contributor with limitations (Dulcich), or a player who struggles to make the roster (Peterson).  The elevator pitch suggesting a combination of Fairweather's best traits and Oronde Gadsden II's suggests a high-upside developmental player with a potential to start, but also a player who will require substantial work.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nFairweather is a high-risk, high-reward prospect. His athleticism and some positive traits suggest potential, but he requires extensive coaching and development to address significant technical deficiencies.  He's likely a practice squad candidate initially, with his future heavily dependent on his ability to improve his route running and blocking consistency.\n"

He has some positives as a blocker \nif he can stop overextending at the point of attack, giving up any chance to dictate terms at the beginning of the interaction. When \nhe doesn’t get beaten to the punch, Dippre has good feel for attack angles and does well at the second-level of the box or the edges.  \nDippre’s pass catching needs work. His technique is sloppy and it leads to too many unforced errors for the NFL. His route running is \nremedial for the pros, because he hasn’t developed the tools to manipulate coverage.  \nDippre’s potential fit in the NFL will be with special teams and as a third tight end who can work shallow zone routes if necessary.  \n\n \n98 \nReleases: Dippre has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front foot. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee. \nDippre releases stepping off his front foot and with no wasted motion from his back foot. It would benefit him to sink into his stance \nand roll off the front foot.  \nDippre counters the hands of defenders playing outside of him with a wipe or a shed. He uses a swat-swim combination against \noutside leverage playing off coverage.  \nDippre has a two-quick attacking outside leverage and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe. He uses a stick with a shed \ncounter to get inside.  \nSeparation: Dippre does not beat defensive backs downfield when they play man-to-man coverage, but he can win up the seam \nagainst linebackers and some safeties. \nRoute Stems: Dippre widens stems against outside leverage before dipping inside.  \nRoute Setups: Dippre must develop setup techniques against zone and man coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Dippre has as flat drive step on speed turns, but drifts with his line step. He presents a friendly target but doesn’t \nsnap the turn. With slower speed turns, he has flat drive and line steps.  \nDippre has a three-step break with weight drop. He breaks back to the quarterback.  \nZone Routes: Dippre identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open zone while presenting a friendly \ntarget.  \nDippre gets his eyes to the quarterback after he has cleared the buzz/rollover defender.  \nRoute Boundary: I didn’t see him operate near the boundary where he could show his skills in this area.  \nPass Tracking: Dippre tracks shallow targets over his shoulder.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Dippre attacks targets at his chest with overhand or underhand position. When targets arrive at torso height, \nDippre is prone to allow the ball into his frame when catching it at the earliest point would be best. He has juggled targets because \nof this behavior.  \nTurning behind his break path and attacking waist-high targets can be problematic for Dippre when he clap-attacks the ball. \nHe has lapses with clap-attacking targets at helmet level with overhand position.  \nDespite him being prone to allow targets into his frame unnecessarily, Dippre can extend for targets away from his frame and make \nthe catch when forced.  \nPosition: Dippre must develop a pull-back when he high-points in contested scenarios. He has dropped accurate targets he \notherwise would have caught.  \nFocus: Dippre can take hits to his back and waist while high pointing and earn the ball. He earns targets tight to his chest with \noverhand position while wrapped at the back.  \nTransitions: Dippre catches and pierces when earning targets where he faces the quarterback.  \nElusiveness: Dippre has an effective spin after taking contact downhill. He kicks his feet up and over low shots. He gets his knees \nhigh as well.  \nDippre has good curvilinear movement around the far-side corner at full speed. He bends around safeties and corners to earn the \nedge on them.  \nDippre can deliver small jump cuts away from pursuit over the top. He times hurdles effectively against defenders shooting low for \nhis legs in the open field.  \nVision: Dippre presses blocks to set up defenders into those blocks or freeze unblocked defenders. He’s a decisive downhill runner \nwhose movements are efficient.  \n\n \n99 \nPower: Dippre leads with his pads into collisions as a runner. He carries cornerbacks wrapped around his frame for additional \nyardage.  \nDippre uses the stiff arm to swat past defenders reaching for his frame.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He pounces off direct collisions with safeties coming downhill and spins off them.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Dippre runs through indirect shots to his torso from safeties coming downhill.  \nBall Security: Dippre carries the ball high to his chest and tight to his side in the open field. He takes contact to the ball and his \nball-carrying arm. He switches the ball to the arm that’s away from the nearest pursuit.  \nBlocking: When blocking a force player, Dippre earns a tight position to the outside shoulder and uses his hands with elbows bent. \nHe can turn smaller linebackers inside with his hands and stance.  \nHe takes the inside shoulder of edge defenders on wind backs and drops the pads in timely fashion not to tip off the effort.  \nDippre breaks down with a square and squat stance within two yards of his assignment on stalk blocks. He shoots his hands with an \nuppercut motion, but drops his head and overextends his pads as he does so. His hands are good enough to reach the opponent’s \nchest and when he has success doing so, he can bring his head and pads up while generating a push.  \nHowever, Dippre’s overextension leads to more bad results than good. He can get beaten to the punch on reach blocks and pushed \ninto the backfield by defenders his size or smaller. He allows opponents to get into his chest and his arms are locked out of \nmeaningful contact to control any part of the interaction.  \nDippre identifies cross blitzes and slides across the line to square the linebacker and delivers an uppercut. He identifies safety blitzes \nand does a good job with one-arm technique to hold and pass off his primary assignment to slide outside to the blitzer.  \nDippre reach-blocks second level defenders and hooks them inside or outside. After an initial strike of a linebacker at the second \nlevel, Dippre quickly switches position to the defender’s side and moves him out of the hole.  \nDurability: No significant injuries reported \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nCJ Dippre Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n100",
        "analysis": "**C.J. Dippre: NFL Draft Profile Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Blocking Potential:** Possesses the athleticism and strength to be a capable blocker at the NFL level, particularly at the second level.  He shows good feel for angles when he doesn't overextend.  Effective in using hands and stance to control smaller linebackers. Shows promise in identifying and reacting to blitzes.\n* **Special Teams Value:**  His athleticism and blocking ability make him a likely contributor on special teams.\n* **Run After Catch:** Shows some elusiveness with effective spins, jump cuts, and hurdle ability to create yards after the catch.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Pass-Catching:**  His pass-catching technique is significantly flawed, leading to dropped passes and inconsistent performance.  Developing improved route running, hand-eye coordination, and overall technique would dramatically increase his value.\n* **Consistency:**  While showing flashes of ability, he needs to consistently execute his blocking techniques to avoid being overwhelmed.  Reducing overextension at the point of attack is crucial.\n* **Overall Development:** He's currently projected as a reserve player or practice squad member, so significant improvement is needed to earn a larger role.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Pass-Catching Technique:** Sloppy technique leads to dropped passes and struggles to create separation against man coverage. Route running is underdeveloped.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** Prone to overextending, getting beaten to the punch, and allowing defenders to control the interaction.\n* **Route Running:** Remedial; lacks the skills to manipulate coverage effectively.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided text doesn't offer specific NFL player comparisons. However, based on his profile, Dippre projects as a player similar to a lower-tier blocking tight end who contributes primarily on special teams.  He might be compared to players who excel in a specific niche role, rather than those with all-around skills.  Think of a player who might be a third or fourth tight end on a roster, offering situational blocking and ST prowess rather than significant receiving production.  He likely won't be a featured player.\n"

He’s a skilled striker with good footwork and exploits leverage advantages well. He could \nmake a roster simply on the merits of his blocking.  \nWhen watching Hawes at Yale and Georgia Tech, he didn’t demonstrate advanced skills with route running. Still, Hawes could earn a \njob in the NFL on the basis of getting open against zones and serving as an outlet receiver. Hawes is a rugged ball carrier who breaks \ntackles.  \nHawes must improve his pass-catching. There are tracking and attack issues that may prove difficult to overcome. If he can, he may \nnever deliver reliable box score production as a receiver but he’ll pose enough of a threat that he can become a starter or frequent \ncontributor for a team on the merits of his blocking. \n\n \n101 \nReleases: Hawes has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee. When he releases, Hawes sinks into his stance and takes an unnecessary step with his front foot. There’s no wasted \nmotion with his back foot.  \nHawes uses a read step against off coverage and counters the defender’s hands with a wipe. He has an effective lean-in at the top of \nstems.  \nFrom a three-point stance, Hawes counters the hands of outside shade coverage with a double swat or a shed.  \nSeparation: Hawes has just enough speed to and acceleration to compete on the field as a middle-of-the-field receiver in the NFL. \nHis acceleration is starter grade, but his long speed is just outside the committee tier.   \nRoute Stems: Hawes must develop stem work. \nRoute Setups: Hawes must develop route setups.  \nRoute Breaks: Hawes has a three-step break but needs to drop his weight into the break. He has flat line and drive steps. He has a \ntwo-quick at the top of his stems on a speed turn with flat drive and line steps. He also snaps the turn.  \nZone Routes: Hawes identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and tempos his breaks across the open zone. He waits \nuntil he has crossed the buzz/rollover defender to show his eyes to the quarterback.  \nHawes works to open space if the first break doesn’t earn a target.  \nRoute Boundary: I didn’t see any routes where he worked near the boundary.  \nPass Tracking: Hawes tracks targets just above helmet level and way from his frame with full extension of his arms without leaving \nhis feet. He tracks targets over his shoulder. When tracking high targets to his back shoulder, he can leave his feet unnecessarily \nwhen the target isn’t above helmet level and the placement doesn’t require a leaping turn.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Hawes fully extends for targets with overhand or underhand position while on the move. He has focus drops \nas he tracks targets at his back shoulder but turns his head too early. \nHe can be guilty of clap-attacking targets when using overhand position. A lot of his drops are clap-attacks of targets using overhand \nposition.  \nPosition: Hawes can embrace the fall when extending away from his frame downfield for a target over his shoulder.  \nFocus: He can take hits to his back or chest and maintain possession of the ball.  \nTransitions: Hawes catches and pierces downhill. \nElusiveness: Hawes spins off contact with a tight motion. He gets his feet up through wraps—kicking his heels toward his backside. \nHe only needs two steps to transition downhill from a perimeter approach to the far-side of the field.  \nVision: He’s a decisive straight-line runner. He finds cutbacks in heavy traffic for additional yardage.  \nPower: Hawes drops his pads into contact in the open field and can keep his feet moving through wraps, pushing defenders \ndownfield. He pulls through reaches to his lower legs. He can drag safety wrapped around his waist more than 10 yards downfield.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He bounces off direct shots from cornerbacks.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off safety’s glancing shots.  \nBall Security: Hawes tucks the ball high to his chest. He can take a hit on the ball and ball carrying arm.  \nBlocking: As a wind-back blocker, Hawes can earn a tight position to his assignment, keep his hands gith and into the chest of the \nopponent, and move his feet after contact.  \nWhen pass protecting off a wind-back motion, Hawes aims for the outside shoulder when he has the potential for help inside. He \nshuffles his feet with a wide stance and keeps his hands tight.  \nWhen on an island as a pass protector, Hawes can overextend, tip his head, and telegraphs his position to edge defenders. A lot of it \nhas to do with him not having the same short-area quickness as pass rushers and if he’s forced to slide to the edge from the \nbackfield, he has little chance.  \n\n \n102 \nWith Man Over Me assignments, Hawes is a skilled striker with good footwork and leverage. He pushes defensive ends off their spots \nand controls interactions long enough for plays to work as designed. He uses his one-arm technique effectively to counter defenders \nredirecting on him.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Hawes earns a squat and squares position and shuffles his feet in a wide stance to work within two yards of the \nassignment. He’s also good at setting up defenders to take an inside or outside path and hooking them away from the runner.  \nAs a puller on Counter, Hawes works to the force player, gets his pads low, and works upward with and uppercut motion of his \nforearms before rolling through his hips. He attempts to transition from his forearms to his hands after the initial contact.  \nHawes can also wind back and deliver an uppercut with his hands and roll through his hips.   \nThere is some lean into reach blocks, but Hawes has an extended uppercut motion into the frame of the defender and he helps him \ngenerate a punch without dropping his head. He sees who he’s hitting.  \nHawes locks his hands onto defenders and is difficult to shake at the line of scrimmage thanks to his stance, strength, and footwork.  \nHawes has the size and leverage to knock defensive ends to the ground with his chip-releases from the three-point stance. \nAs a Most Dangerous Man blocker, he takes the correct shoulder and hooks the opponent. \nDurability: Not significant injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor Hawes during camp. If you hear praise about his receiving, he’s worth a speculative \naddition because his blocking is good enough for him to start in the league.

His biggest strength is his blocking; he's described as a skilled striker with good footwork and leverage, excelling in various blocking schemes (wind-back, stalk, puller, chip-release). He consistently wins at the point of attack, displaying impressive power and control.  His blocking alone projects him as a potential NFL roster player.\n\nHowever, Hawes' receiving skills are a significant area of concern. While he can get open against zone coverages and is a rugged ball carrier, he struggles with route running, tracking, and consistent catching.  His pass-catching issues, including focus drops and a tendency to \"clap-attack\" targets, limit his potential as a reliable receiving threat.  His speed is adequate for middle-of-the-field routes, but his long speed is below the ideal level.\n\n**Opportunities:**  Hawes' exceptional blocking makes him a viable NFL player. If he can even marginally improve his receiving skills to become a reliable outlet receiver, he could earn a starting role or significant playing time.\n\n**Weaknesses:** His receiving skills are his biggest hurdle.  Improving route running, tracking, and catching consistency are crucial for him to reach his full potential.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Tucker Kraft is listed as his closest comparison, but this comparison likely hinges on Hawes significantly improving his receiving.  Without that improvement, a more accurate comparison might be a blocking-specialist tight end, who may not be a frequent target in the passing game.  He could be similar to a player who excels as a run blocker and contributes in short-yardage situations.\n"

He can get open against zone coverage and help out at \nthe line of scrimmage.  \nHe’s not winning many man-to-man routes, he clap-drops too many targets, and he has difficulty changing direction in open space \nas a route runner, blocker, and ball carrier.  \nEvans will compete for a role on special teams and serve as a situational third or fourth tight end.  \nReleases: When operating as a detached receiver, Evans uses a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front \nleg. His arms hang at either side of his front knee.  \n\n \n104 \nWhen Evans begins his release, he sinks into his stance, rocks off the back foot unnecessarily, and rolls off the front foot. Evans can \nsink into his stance and roll off his front foot without rocking off the back foot. He showed it late in the year against Penn State and \ndid it multiple times.  \nFrom an inline stance, Evans uses a read step to attack inside leverage before working up the seam. He uses a two-step pattern to \nbegin his speed break inside.  \nEvans attacks outside leverage with a stick and counters with a lean-in. The stick has no artistry with pacing. The same is lacking \nwith his double up and wipe counter.  \nEvans counters a defender’s hands from inside leverage with a shed. He attempts a swat-swim, but uses the wrong arm for each \nmove.  \nSeparation: Evans has enough acceleration to threaten linebackers up the seam.  \nRoute Stems: Evans widens stems against outside leverage.  \nRoute Setups: Evans can hold the safety over the top of him when he turns his head and eyes inside as he runs a stem up the \nseam. Evans delivers a peek near the top of his stem against off-coverage to set up the dig.  \nHe’ll run a stair-step against off-coverage to set up his break.  \nRoute Breaks: Evans must deliver flatter drive and line steps on shallow out-breaking routes. He drifts too much for a receiver who \nis breaking outside with little downhill momentum into the stem. When he runs the route at a slow pace, he generates flat drive and \nline steps.  \nEvans has reps where his drive step is flat but the line step still drifts. He gets his head around early in the break and he presents a \nfriendly target.  \nEvans has a three-quick break—sometimes with a long break step preceding it—but there is no weight drop. The execution lacks the \ndeceleration for him to separation against any coverage but significant zone cushions.  \nZone Routes: Evans identifies the second level of the defense, works to depth, and doesn’t show his eyes to the quarterback until \nhe has passed the buzz/rollover defender when running a vertical route. Evans also knows when tempo his breaks and when to settle \nunder the zone.  \nEvans snaps his turn on zone routes breaking to face the quarterback. He punches the boundary arm to generate the suddenness. If \nhis first break doesn’t earn a target, he’ll work to an open zone. \nRoute Boundary: Evans toe-taps inside the endline on a vertical route. He’s aware of the boundary on back-shoulder targets and \ncan tightrope his way along the boundary as he transitions from backing toward the boundary at the catch point to running \ndownfield.  \nPass Tracking: Evans tracks the ball over his shoulder. He can extend wide from his frame while tracking over his shoulder and \nattacks with over hand position.  \nEvans doesn’t leave his feet unnecessarily. He can turn back for the ball with a defender trailing him and attack with overhand \nposition with leaving his feet.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Evans turns behind his break path to catch targets. He can catch with underhand attack at the numbers. \nHe’s prone to clap-attacking high-point opportunities, which leads to drops.  \nHe can extend his arms away from his frame for low targets thrown behind his break path. He can pluck the ball just below his knees  \nPosition: Evans uses a pull-back after high-pointing a target.  \nFocus: Evans can take a hit to his chest as he extends for a target and turns through the catch point to face the defender coming \ndownhill. He can pull the ball through the hands of the trailing defender. He catches targets with a defender on his back.  \nTransitions: Evans adjusts to the target, obeying the ball to deliver a catch and pierce based on the direction of the target.  \nElusiveness: Evans lacks short-area quickness and dynamic range of movement as a runner. He’s nimble enough to dive-roll over a \nshot to his lower legs when he’s within a few yards of the goal line.  \nVision: Evans displays good awareness of the goal line.  \n\n \n105 \nPower: Evans spins off contact and pushes through wraps to earn additional yardage.  \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: He bounces off glancing shots from linebackers.  \nBall Security: Evans tucks the ball to his chest and to the boundary-side arm.  \nBlocking: As a wind-back blocker, Evans aims for the force defender’s chest and delivers a shoulder with force.  \nWhen sealing in the inside, Evans earns a flat lead, breaks down within two yards of the defender and shuffles his feet with a wide \nstance. He generates enough bend in his stance to anchor through contact. Evans also attacks the appropriate shoulder of the \ndefender to turn the opponent away from the ball carrier.  \nWhen stalk blocking, Evans gets his hands tight and aims for the chest of the defender as he closes the gap between himself and his \nopponent. Because he doesn’t deliver an uppercut punch with a roll through his hips, his strike doesn’t stand up the defender. \nInstead, his double jabs push the defender backward and Evans’ recoils backward as well. This creates a gap between then and the \ndefender has more room to shed Evans.  \nIn tight quarters against an edge defender, Evans can deliver an uppercut and roll through his hips after he has positioned his hands \ninside. The strike may lack pop, but the movement with the hip roll stands up the opponent.  \nDurability: Evans missed final four games in 2023 with an ACL injury. He missed five games to begin the 2022 season due to a foot \ninjury during the summer.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nBlade releases, uses eyes vs. safety, high-point, pull-back, clap-drop \n• \nJabbing vs uppercutting as a blocker \n• \nBack-shoulder, no jump, pulls through DB, boundary awareness \n• \nMitchell Evans Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n106",
        "analysis": "Mitchell Evans is a tight end prospect with a blend of strengths and weaknesses that project him as a potential reserve or practice squad player in the NFL.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Size and Speed:** Evans possesses good size (6'5\", 258 lbs) and adequate speed for the position.  He can create separation against zone coverages.\n* **Zone Awareness:**  He demonstrates a good understanding of zone defenses, effectively working to open areas and timing his breaks.\n* **High-Point Catching:** He shows the ability to high-point the ball and make contested catches, although this is inconsistent.\n* **Blocking Prowess (Situational):** He displays competent blocking skills in certain situations, particularly sealing inside and wind-blocking. He can anchor against contact.\n* **Boundary Awareness:** He shows awareness of the sideline, effectively using it to his advantage.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Improved Route Running:**  Refining his route running techniques, particularly his breaks and ability to change direction, could significantly improve his NFL potential.  Addressing his \"clap-drops\" (dropping easy catches) is crucial.\n* **Consistency:**  Evans needs to become more consistent in all facets of his game. His strong performances are often interspersed with weaker ones.\n* **Man Coverage:**  Improving his ability to win against man-to-man coverage is vital for a more well-rounded game.\n* **Blocking Power:** Increasing the power behind his blocking techniques would make him a more reliable asset in the run game.\n\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route Running Technique:**  His route running needs significant improvement. He struggles with changes of direction and often lacks precision in his breaks.\n* **Man Coverage Issues:**  He struggles to consistently win against man coverage.\n* **Drops:**  A concerning number of drops, particularly on catchable balls, are a major area for concern.\n* **Blocking Consistency:** While showing flashes, his blocking is inconsistent and often lacks power.\n* **Durability:**  A history of injuries (ACL and foot) raises concerns about his long-term health.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided profile doesn't offer a specific NFL player comparison.  However, based on his strengths and weaknesses, Evans could be compared to a fringe NFL tight end who excels in specific situations but lacks the overall polish to be a consistent starter.  He might be compared to a player with a similar size/speed profile but who primarily contributes on special teams and as a situational offensive player.  Think of a player who is more of a project than a finished product.\n"

He’s patient, decisive, and gets his feet and knees high enough to work over low \nshots from pursuit.  \nSimon has potential to become a competent route runner against zone and man-to-man coverage, but he has work to do with his \nbreaks. Simon catches the ball at a variety of angles, but his technique has too many leaks to say he’s reliable at catching the ball at \na variety of angles.  \nThe athletic ability to become a viable H-Back is there, but the details and techniques of becoming a reliable threat are not. Teams \nwill elect to use a large receiver ahead of Simon unless he gains 10-15 pounds and improves the totality of his game. \n\n \n107 \nSpecial teams is his first path to making this happen.  \nReleases: Simon has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His arms hang at either side of his \nfront knee.  \nWhen he begins his release, Simon has lapses where he leans forward and takes a step with his front foot. He should sink into his \nstance and roll off the front foot, which is what he does with other reps.  \nSimon gets his pads over his knees temporarily, but he’d generate a better lean if he sunk into his stance.  \nSimon counters the hands of a defender with outside leverage with a wipe or a swat. He reduces his shoulder from outside leverage \nas he exits the line of scrimmage. \nFrom a three-point stance, Simon delivers a read step with a swat or shed counter that’s effective against the outside-shade \ndefender. He also counters inside leverage with a wipe.  \nHe has a stick and swim counter.  \nSimon sells the vertical nature of his stem.  \nSeparation: Simon has the speed and acceleration to beat linebackers and stretch safeties on vertical routes.  \nRoute Stems: Simon will dive inside outside leverage to set up a sideline fade.  \nRoute Setups: Simon gives what could be considered a peek during his stem, but the head turn is so small and so quick that it’s not \neffective. He gives a more effective head fake to the inside at the top of his stems, but could add a turn with his chest pads and/or \nhips to sell an inset.  \nSimon can take the back of the defender to set up a vertical break.  \nSimone delivers a two-quick at the top of his stem that transitions into a flat speed break.  \nRoute Breaks: Simon gets his head around quickly out of the break. He has a three-step break with weight drop, but he doesn’t \naccelerate into the top of the stem. Off-coverage sitting on the route has no reason to turn its hips and buy into a vertical route.  \nSimon delivers flat drive and line steps when executing speed turns.  \nSimon uses a break step effectively with weight drop to deliver a drop and pop break. He also snaps the turn on the break.  \nZone Routes: Simon identifies the second level off the defense and works to depth. He doesn’t settle effectively, drifting 1-2 steps \nafter the initial turn. He winds up drifting into coverage. This is a lapse in behavior more than a habit. Simon has shown that he can \nsettle under the zone decisively.  \nWhen breaking across zone defenders, he tempos his break and waits until he has passed the buzz/rollover defender to show his \neyes to the quarterback \nRoute Boundary: Simon is aware of the boundary and can toe-tap both feet to remain inbounds. When high-pointing near the \nboundary, Simon must begin his leap earlier and toward the target rather than toward the boundary. This will help him get both feet \nin bounds.  \nPass Tracking: Simon tracks the ball over his shoulder on shallow routes. Simon doesn’t leave his feet unless the target demands \nit. He’s effective with turning through back-shoulder targets.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Simon catches the ball with underhand attack away from his frame. He attacks the ball at the earliest point \nof arrival when it’s at chest height.  \nSimon clap-attacks high-point targets and targets over his shoulder using underhand attack where he’s also forced to extend his \narms. When he extends his arms, the hands get wider just before the ball arrives, and he’s forced to clap-attack. \nSimon extends away from his frame and ahead of his break path to catch the ball without clap-attacking—with overhand or \nunderhand attack. It appears the clap-attacking occurs when there’s extension above his shoulders.  \nSimon digs out low throws below his knees and turns behind his break path to do so.  \nHe uses underhand attack for targets where he has time and space to use overhand position.  \n\n \n108 \nPosition: Simon embraces the fall when digging out low throws. He pulls the ball away from the oncoming defender after earning a \ntarget above his head or away from his frame.  \nFocus: Simon can take hits to his back as he catches the ball. He can win the ball with a defender reaching for the ball at his \nnumbers while negotiating the boundary. He can also take a hard hit to the chest as he high points up the seam. I saw one catch out \nof several targets during his career where he won against man coverage that, at my most generous, I would consider “tight \ncoverage.”  \nTransitions: Simon catches and pierces downhill after tracking the ball over his shoulder toward the boundary. He obeys the \nlocation of the ball to dictate which way he catches and pierces.  \nElusiveness: Simon has an effective stick to set up cutbacks. He gets his knees and feet high and over low shots.  \nSimon spins through reach and wrap attempts so he can at least extend forward for additional yardage. Simon has smooth \ncurvilinear speed to take the short corner as a ball carrier.  \nSimon only needs two steps to cut inside pursuit over the top while running downhill at full speed.  \nVision: Simon will press the defender’s leverage on a block to set up a cutback.  \nPower: Simon keeps his feet moving through wraps to his torso or legs. He will drop his pads into a safety in the open field and run \nthrough the contact. He drag defenders downfield when they wrap his torso and he’ll mitigate reaches and/or a single wrap attempt. \nDirect Contact Balance: N/A \nIndirect Contact Balance: Simon wins collisions with safeties in the open field, dropping his pads into the glancing shot and \nrunning past.  \nBall Security: Simon tucks the ball under his boundary-side arm and close to his chest. He can handle contact to his ball-carrying \narm, but his elbow is loose enough from his frame that a well-executed punch can pop the ball loose.  \nBlocking: Simon overextends as a puller on Counter. He drops his head into the linebacker in the crease—even with his hands \nextended—and the defender earns the first contact and dictates the action from there. He gets thrown around after any initial push \nbecause the defender has his hands on Simon while Simon is fighting to get his hands on the defender while they are on the move.  \nAs a lead blocker on Wham, Simon can earn tight position to a defender’s side. He leads with his forearms into the defender’s side. \nAs a lead blocker working to the edge, he must learn to deliver a meaningful strike with his hands. He leans into contact and there’s \nlittle force behind it.   \nSimon picks up edge pressure as a pass protector. Although he catches contact, he has quick feet and can push on the correct \nshoulder of the defender to run the opponent outside the pocket.  \nWhen facing a safety, Simon’s feet are quick enough to regain position and he’s strong enough not to get overwhelmed but in the \nNFL, he’ll be facing edge rushers as quick as him and much stronger.  \nWhen attacking an edge rusher in the pocket, Simon can turn the defender’s inside shoulder to the outside. His hands aren’t narrow \nenough to get into the defender’s chest.  \nSimon understands which shoulder of the defender’s to setup with his approach to the assignment within the scope of the play and \nwhere/when to attack. He’s also quick-footed enough to hop inside from a three-point stance to earn the correct position.  \nWhen winding back, Simon is aggressive and can get his pads and/or forearms into the chest of a lineman to stall the defender’s \npush.  \nAs a stalk blocker, Simon can drop his weight, square the defender, and shuffle his feet in a wide stance to work laterally with the \nopponent.  \nDurability: Simon missed the Wofford game in 2024 with an injury. In 2021, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the opener.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar.  \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nClap-attacked high-point/dug out low and behind break point \n• \nClap-attack in end zone and sets off chain of events more difficult to execute \n• \nJoshua Simon Highlights \n\n \n109",
        "analysis": "Joshua Simon is a TE prospect ranked 22nd by RSP, possessing a blend of athleticism and receiving skills but lacking refinement in several key areas.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Athleticism and Speed:** Simon's speed and acceleration allow him to separate from linebackers and safeties on vertical routes.  He shows good elusiveness after the catch, utilizing quick cuts and high knee drive to evade tackles.\n* **After-the-Catch Ability:** He excels at making plays in space, showcasing good vision and the ability to run through contact.\n* **Pass-Catching in Space:** Simon demonstrates proficiency catching the ball in the flats and on short routes, particularly as an outlet receiver.  He displays a 100% catch rate on pinpoint targets.\n* **Blocking Potential (with caveats):** He shows flashes of pass protection skills, particularly quick feet and understanding of leverage.  He also shows some ability as a lead blocker, though needs significant improvement.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Route Running:** His route running needs significant improvement, particularly his breaks and ability to sell routes effectively.  He struggles consistently to create separation against man coverage.\n* **Hand Technique:** While he demonstrates a high catch percentage on certain routes, his hand technique is inconsistent, relying too heavily on the \"clap attack\" and needing refinement for improved reliability.\n* **Strength and Size:** He needs to add 10-15 pounds to compete effectively at the NFL level, especially as a blocker.  His current size hinders his effectiveness in contested catches and blocking assignments.\n* **Blocking Consistency:**  His blocking is inconsistent. While displaying flashes of ability in pass protection and lead blocking, his technique and strength need substantial improvement to be NFL-ready.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report doesn't provide a specific NFL player comparison, but his profile suggests a player who might develop into a situational H-back or a backup tight end, similar to a player who excels in the short passing game but lacks the size and overall skill set to be a true every-down player.  He might also be likened to a larger slot receiver who is effective after the catch, but whose blocking needs significant refinement.  Think of a player with the after-catch ability of a Darren Waller but the size and blocking consistency of a much smaller, less developed player. His ceiling is likely limited unless he addresses the significant weaknesses.  His path to the NFL is likely via special teams initially.\n"

He’s also a linear mover. He’ll intrigue on highlights as a \npass-catcher. That’s likely the extent of his intrigue.  \n \n\n \n110 \nReleases: Prieskorn has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring his front leg. His hands rest uncrossed on his \nfront knee. When he begins his release, he sinks into his stance and takes a step with his front foot. If he can curtail that step, he’d \nrelease from the line without wasted motion.  \nPrieskorn uses a double up or stick at the top of his stems to set up breaks to the outside against inside leverage. He uses a two-\nquick release near the line of scrimmage.  \nHe reduces his shoulder from off-coverage at the top of stems.  \nSeparation: He can separation from linebackers and some safeties up the seam.  \nRoute Stems: Prieskorn will dive his stems against inside leverage playing off-coverage on vertical-breaking routes.  \nRoute Setups: Prieskorn must develop some skills with setups during his stems to manipulate coverage.  \nRoute Breaks: Prieskorn’s drive and line steps aren’t sharp enough for flat breaks and he drifts out of speed breaks when facing \ntight coverage. When facing off-coverage, Prieskorn’s speed breaks have flat drive and line steps. He presents a friendly target to the \nquarterback.  \nZone Routes: Prieskorn identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When the first break \ndoesn’t earn a target, Prieskorn works to the open area and maintains a friendly target for his quarterback.  \nRoute Boundary: Prieskorn is aware of the boundary and can get a foot inbounds and often two.  \nPass Tracking: Prieskorn has the hand-eye coordination to extend one arm fully to the ball and make an underhand catch while \ntracking the ball over his shoulder and tapping his feet inbounds.  \nPrieskorn has late hands to wait until the last moment to attack the ball.  \nHands/Catch Radius: Prieskorn attacks the ball at the earliest point of arrival when the target’s trajectory is on the numbers of his \njersey or above his knees. He attacks early with overhand and underhand position. He can also attack late with underhand position.  \nPrieskorn has lapses where his hands are too wide and he clap-attacks targets. He’s a skill fingertips-style catcher who can earn \nsecond-chance catch opportunities with difficult targets.  \nPosition: He is effective with backside turns to extend for fades and at the earliest point of the targets arrival. He embraces the fall \nagainst tight coverage. He also has an effective pull-back.  \nFocus: Prieskorn takes hits to his back, arms, and hands while extending to the earliest point to earn a target with overhand \nposition on a stop route. He can take hard contact to his back and catch a target arriving above his head with his feet on the ground.  \nTransitions: Prieskorn catches and pierces downhill after earning the ball facing the quarterback. He’ll obey the ball to determine \nthe direction of his catch and pierce.  \nElusiveness: Prieskorn is mobile with his upper body and can extend and turn for targets. His lower body movements aren’t \ndynamic. He doesn’t make the first defender miss in the open field as one would expect. He also trips over his own feet attempting \nthese moves. His best work in this area is altering his stride length to dip away from pursuit or into a blocked crease.  \nVision: Prieskorn is a straight-line mover lacking the quickness or footwork to create significant yardage after the catch.  \nPower: Prieskorn keeps his feet moving after contact. He can carry a linebacker 7-10 yards on his back. He does not pull through \nwraps to his legs often.  \nDirect Contact Balance: He stalemates a safety hitting him head-on.  \nIndirect Contact Balance: Prieskorn bounces off cornerbacks and safeties delivering glancing shots to his frame.  \nBall Security: Prieskorn tucks the ball to the boundary-side arm, but is prone to using his right arm by default. When in traffic the \nball is close to his chest and he can keep the elbow tight to his side except when it comes loose as he’s making dynamic moves to \nwork through or avoid tacklers.  \nBlocking: As a stalk blocker, Prieskorn uses a square and squat stance with his feet wide and in a balanced position. He doesn’t \nclose the gap enough between himself and his opponent. Although the gap is wider than it should be, Prieskorn’s elbows are bent \nwhen he extends his arms toward the assignment.  \n\n \n111 \nWhen used as a puller, Prieskorn earns a tight position against the linebacker at the other end of the crease. There is no air between \nthem when Prieskorn engages and he doesn’t overextend. \nA punch would be optimal, but he doesn’t deliver one. He doesn’t strike hard with his pads – it often appears that he’s meeting the \ndefender with contact rather than initiating a collision or a strike when the contact comes in the box. Outside the box, Prieskorn’s \nmomentum generates more intensity.  \nBecause Prieskorn isn’t a puncher, he’s forced to move his feet as a reaction to the defender’s movement instead of moving his feet \nto dictate the action.  \nAs a lead blocker on perimeter plays, Prieskorn must develop more patience with assignments over the top of him in open space. He \ntips off his intentions because he doesn’t wait for the defender to come to him after getting within 2-3 yards of the assignment.  \nAlthough large enough to withstand the first punch of many edge defenders when he anchors his stance, Prieskorn must work on \nearning the first strike to dictate terms. Because he’s not a puncher, he can also overextend as a method of compensation.  \nWhen working from a three-point stance with a defensive end over hm, Prieskorn gets his hands tight to work into the chest of the \ndefender. He moves his feet to stay with the opponent, never closes the gap enough to control the opponent.  \nHe gives up the edge too easily when pass protecting. He has difficulty identifying and timing his blocks against twists and games \nwith pass rushers.  \nWith blocks where Prieskorn can take an angle to the defender’s shoulder or side, Prieskorn can close the gap between them. When \nhe’s working downhill, Prieskorn doesn’t close the gap effectively.  \nPrieskorn can get confused with which defender is the Most Dangerous Man assignment when leading his ball carrier to the edge on a \nperimeter run. He has overrun the most dangerous defender on the play only to double back and not get his hands on any defender.  \nHe attempts to earn the outside shoulder of the force defender and hook them inside but he doesn’t earn that initial position well \nenough and the force defender still earns angles to the ball carrier.  \nWhen Prieskorn gets his hands locked onto a linebacker or defensive end who has lost his leverage, Prieskorn can be effective in the \npocket because of his size. This often works as a backside cut-off blocker or combo blocker to the second level of the defense and \nattacking an unsuspecting defender.  \nAt this point of his development, Prieskorn is at his best as a backside blocker who walls off defenders or participates in double \nteams. He has some utility as a stalk blocker, but it would be best if he’s part of a bunch set so he’s on an island with a defender as \nthe only lead blocker.  \nDurability: No known injuries.  \nPre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Monitor from afar. \n \nBoiler/Film Room Material (Links to plays): \n• \nOne-handed grab with full extension while tracking over the shoulder at the boundary \n• \nOne-handed back shoulder with full extension with late hands and late window at boundary \n• \nOne-handed away from frame \n• \nOne-handed juggled catch over the shoulder vs. tight coverage with pull back and embracing the fall \n• \nCaden Prieskorn Highlights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n112 \n \nTE (Depth of Talent) Rankings Table \n \nNote: Times and measurements are from the NFL Combine or Pro Day workouts. “Potential” is my assessment of the player’s \ndevelopment curve based on the potential for the athlete to improve his strength and athleticism with additional training or learning \nthe techniques and concepts of his position.  \n \nPlayers labeled “Upside” have additional opportunities to become better athletes and/or technicians at their position.  \n \nPlayers earning the “Boom-Bust” label generally have a high level of athleticism but lack the knowledge of a skill or concept that \ncould be difficult to learn.

The criteria the RSP uses for its checklist are a broad range of job requirements that encompass \na spectrum of things a player may be asked to perform with a team. Few teams require a player to fulfill every requirement.  \nIt’s common that a successful contributor in an offense is competent in 65-75 percent of this range of tasks. In some cases, a player \nis only asked to perform half of these requirements and he’s still a major asset to the offense.  \nThe broader the player’s breadth of talent, the more likely he’ll find a fit with a team doing something: special teams, sub package \nwork, or specialized work as a starter. Depth of talent plays a role in that outcome.  \nThe table below is sorted by Breadth of Talent, but the ranking in the first column is based on Depth of Talent Scores so you can \ncross reference the data.

In practice, this is a hit-or-miss process that, at the very least, is an entertaining exercise.  \n \nEach “-“ is an approximate level of separation between one player’s talent and the next. The key word is “talent,” because there are \nsome players with lesser careers listed ahead of more famous or productive peers. This is my subjective interpretation of talent and \nnot success.  \n \nFor example, in the running back section a few years ago, I had LaMont Jordan ahead of Chester Taylor on a spectrum of comparison \nfor a runner on the RB list. Taylor had arguably had the better career, but I believe Jordan had Star Caliber potential that Taylor \nlacked.  \n \n \nTier \nRank \nName \nHt \nW \nCollege \nTalent \nBreadth \nComparison \nCommentary \nI \nTE1 \nColston Loveland \n6'5\" \n248 \nMichigan \n88.8 \n74.25 \nGeorge Kittle - T.J. \nHockenson/Tyler Eifert/X \nLoveland has all of the tools to become one of \nhis team's top-three receiving options who can \nstretch any part of the field and help at the \nline. \nI \nTE2 \nMason Taylor \n6'5\" \n251 \nLSU \n86.3 \n67.75 \nX/Mark Andrews \nA smooth-operating route runner with catch-\npoint toughness and skill after the catch.

It is not an updated ranking, but rather, a \nlook at how I would have seen these players from the same starting point as prospects without a team prior to the draft. Think of the \nlist as one solely about grading talent and not landing spot, scheme, or how the player performed in the NFL.  \n \nThe long-term, aspirational goal of this combined list will be to develop a workable score that has some value across draft classes. \nBecause the RSP’s process is built on continuous improvement, adjustments to the scoring criteria will make this aspirational goal \ndifficult to attain over the course of the next few years.  \n \nThe realistic goal of this combined list is entertainment value and a starting point for the reader to conduct research on his own that \nmay prove helpful for fantasy leagues. Here are possible ways this list may help:  \n \n• \nA combined present and short-term historical perspective on the value of players and draft picks at the position. \n• \nPerspective on emerging, unproven, or declining players (helpful for formulating trade value). \n• \nA short-term historical perspective with physical and athletic measurements.  \n \nAn updated three-year ranking based on how I see these players heading into the 2018 season will be available in the RSP Post-\nDraft Publication.  \n \nNote: I suggest beginning your examination using tiers by Depth of Talent Score and demarcate the tiers by 10 points: \n \n• \nTier 1: 90-100 \n• \nTier 2: 80-89 \n• \nTier 3: 70-79 \n• \nTier 4: 60-69 \n \nFocus more on the range these players fall rather than the linear order. \n \n  \nRank \nName \nHt \nW \nCollege \nTalent \nBreadth \n40 \n20S \n3C \nV \nB \nCommentary \nRole \nTE1 \nBrock Bowers \n6'3\" \n243 \nGeorgia \n91.2 \n78.5 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nBowers should develop into \na primary passing-down \nweapon who can win \nanywhere on the field.  \nPrimary Matchup \nReceiver \nTE2 \nColston Loveland \n6'5\" \n248 \nMichigan \n88.8 \n74.25 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nLoveland has all of the \ntools to become one of his \nteam's top-three receiving \noptions who can stretch \nany part of the field and \nhelp at the line. \nStarting TE \nTE3 \nDalton Kincaid \n6'4\" \n246 \nUtah \n87.8 \n79.75 \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nN/A \nKincaid has match-up \npotential vs. man.

        "analysis": "## Caden Prieskorn Player Profile Summary:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Exceptional Hands and Catch Radius:** Prieskorn displays incredible hand-eye coordination, consistently making one-handed catches, including difficult back-shoulder grabs and catches in tight coverage.  He demonstrates a knack for high-point catches and securing the ball even when taking significant contact. His \"fingertips-style\" catching allows for second-chance opportunities.\n* **Body Control and Focus:** He maintains focus while taking hits, demonstrating the ability to secure the ball even when taking blows to his back, arms, and hands.  He shows good body control and awareness of the boundary.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Route Running and Blocking:** Prieskorn's route running and blocking techniques are significantly underdeveloped. His route stems, breaks, and setups need improvement, and he struggles to create separation consistently. As a blocker, he struggles to engage effectively, often reacting to the defender's movements rather than dictating the action. He lacks the punch needed for effective blocks, particularly in the box.\n* **Linear Movement and Elusiveness:** He is a linear mover lacking dynamic lower body movements, hindering his ability to create yardage after the catch and elude tacklers. While he can use his upper body to extend and turn for targets, his lower body struggles limit his effectiveness.\n* **Ball Security:** Although generally secure, he shows a tendency to rely on his right arm, leading to potential issues when making dynamic moves.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe scout compares him to Terrance Ferguson and Joe Klopfenstein, suggesting a player with some impressive highlight-reel potential (catching ability) but significant deficiencies in other areas that prevent him from being a highly-ranked prospect.  The comparison indicates a player with potential to make plays as a receiver but a long way to go in terms of overall development and reliability.  The low RSP ranking (TE23) and \"Developmental\" talent classification further support this assessment.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nPrieskorn possesses exceptional hands and an impressive ability to make difficult catches. However, significant improvements in route running, blocking, and overall athleticism are required for him to have any meaningful impact in the NFL. He projects as a practice squad player or at best a low-end contributor with a very limited role. His ceiling is capped by his current skillset deficiencies, despite his impressive highlight reel.\n"
