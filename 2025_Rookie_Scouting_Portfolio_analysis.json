After 4-6 years of questioning whether recent \ndevelopments have been an anomaly, the 2015-24 quarterback classes have done enough to tell us that the many NFL \nclubs have embraced the idea of fitting the scheme to the player rather than forcing the player to adapt to the scheme.  \n \nThough the NFL has borrowed from the college and high school levels, professional football is not remotely close to having \nthe offensive diversity of the college or high school game.  \n \nThere are still traditional West Coast offenses like Kyle Shanahan’s where fullbacks aren’t a mythological creature and tight \nends that play in-line aren’t an endangered species.  \n \nOn the other end of the spectrum, the Baltimore Ravens often compress the field to create outside rushing lanes for the \nmost dynamic runner at the quarterback position since Michael Vick. The Eagles used a lot of spread concepts and read \noption to ease Jalen Hurts into the league. Jayden Daniels, while known for his deep passing, operates in a Kliff Kingsbury \noffense that does a vast majority its work within the first five yards of the line of scrimmage.  \n \nAnalysts have accepted the trend towards quarterbacks who can move and threaten the defense with their rushing ability. \nMany are now declaring that the age of the classic pocket quarterback died with Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Ben \nRoethlisberger leaving the game.  \n \nProclamations are exciting. They generate clicks, lead to arguments that generate more clicks, and now that you’re \nthoroughly frustrated with your descent into the cesspool of the comments section or your social media exchanges. \nEventually, your brain has been appropriately tenderized to click the ad for the five best stock tips of 2023 or the sports \nhandicapper posing as Nostradamus.  \n \nThough the dopamine rush of the internet click machine is real, the NFL pocket isn’t goi",

Quarterbacks who run \nmust still win from the pocket in pivotal situations.  \n \nPocket play is a craft that passers can’t acquire quickly or simply, and the flaws in long-term quarterback development \nremain the same. A look at the recent quarterback classes reveals why this is the case.  \n \nThe network media gave weak marks to the 2016 class before the NFL Combine. Critics of the class believed that the \nvaluation of Jared Goff and Carson Wentz was on equal terms with Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota from 2015 was \nstrictly an attention-seeking ploy to promote the entertainment value of the NFL Draft.  \n \nThe short-term and reactionary perspectives of media and fans panned Goff after a difficult rookie year. If you asked most \nanalysts which of the four would have the best career 6-7 years later, Goff would have been the last choice. Now, he might \nbe the best. Many thought the Lions would draft Goff’s eventual replacement last year, but Hendon Hooker is a \ndevelopmental option, and Goff led the Lions within minutes of their first Super Bowl.  \n \nCritics of the media believe the buzz about each new crop of players is an annual phenomenon of draft season analysis. \nRegardless of the reputation the current quarterback class earns before the NFL Combine, there’s a belief that national \ntelevision media’s broadcast agreements with the league influences the amount of buzz given to the top 2-3 passers in the \nclass.  \n \nCritics see this as a healthy, pre-draft public relations boost because it benefits their employers when the NFL has dramatic \nstory arcs.

The national football media needs \ncompelling stories and quarterback-driven narratives generate lots of interest.  \n \nThree years ago, several of the Big Media sites saw draft coverage decline significantly from previous years. The rationale \nfor the loss in attention? A lack of top quarterback talent.  \n \nSo, yes, there has been some truth to the idea that quarterback talent drives the perception of a draft’s value. And whether \nthat value is real or largely projection, the NFL perpetuates the media narrative by continually selecting passers in the first \nround as much on the basis of projection and potential as on proven skill.  \n \nDuring an ESPN NFL Draft special several years ago, Hall of Fame head coach Bill Parcells told the audience that if a team \nbelieves a prospect might have potential to develop into a franchise quarterback it must take that quarterback in the first \nround or miss its chance. It’s this attitude, the league’s draft habits, and the low success rate of quarterback development \nthat reinforce the idea that teams are desperate for quarterbacks. \n \nAs a result, the national media recognizes the self-fulfilling prophecy – and the value of gaining viewer eyeballs – that result \nfrom touting quarterbacks as potential first-round picks and making them the focal points of draft-season narratives.  \n \nHowever, much to my personal delight, the NFL didn’t bite on the 2022 class – Kenny Pickett was the only quarterback \nselected before the third round and was not a top-15 pick.  \n\n \n3 \n \nThe 2022 class still lends itself well to what I’ve been saying for a number of years.

And, most importantly, \nthe concept can be called from almost any formation or set. Who does what changes, but the theory and tactics \ndriving the play do not. “In essence, you’re running the same play,” said Perkins. “You’re just giving them some \nwindow-dressing to make it look different.” \nThe biggest advantage of the concept-based system is that it operates from the perspective of the most critical \nplayer on offense: the quarterback. In other systems, even if the underlying principles are the exact same, the play \nand its name might be very different. Rather than juggling all this information in real time, an Erhardt-Perkins \nquarterback only has to read a given arrangement of receivers. “You can cut down on the plays and get different \nlooks from your formations and who’s in them. It’s easier for the players to learn. It’s easier for the quarterback to \nlearn,” former Patriots offensive coordinator Charlie Weis said back in 2000. “You get different looks without \nchanging his reads. You don’t need an open-ended number of plays.” \nThis simplicity is one of the reasons coaches around the league have been gravitating to the Erhardt-Perkins \napproach. “Concepts benefit you because you can plug different guys into different formations, into different \npersonnel groups, and if they understand the concept, it gives you more flexibility,” [then] Atlanta Falcons \noffensive coordinator Dirk Koetter recently explained. “The number system restricts you because it doesn’t allow \nyou to cover all the combinations you want to use, so you have to get into so many tags that eventually you’re \ncalling everybody’s route.

According to coaches I have spoken to, the old guards’ egos are \n(understandably) tied to these systems, because it’s the method they used to build their careers.  \n \nBut these offenses were successful when there was more continuity in the league and patience with coaches and players \nwas longer.

I looked at 20 years of first-round picks since 1993—not \ncounting 2013 or 2014. There were 51 quarterbacks selected in the first round. Only 22 were what I call “good starters.” \nHere are the criteria: \n \n• \nLed his team to the playoffs at least once.  \n• \nEarned at least one trip to the Pro Bowl. \n• \nEarned top-five statistical production in meaningful passing categories (yards, touchdowns, and completion \npercentage) more than once. \n \nThe success rate for a first-round quarterback since 1993 is 45 percent — worse odds than a coin flip — but slightly higher \nthan Dan Hatman’s 34 percent rate for all first-round players. When I raised the bar to “star”, which I would expect to get if \nI invested a top-15 pick in the draft, the success rate for all first-round passers dropped to 17 percent.  \n \nYou can read the rest here, but the takeaway from this exercise is that a major investment in quarterbacks does not yield a \nworthwhile return.

McNabb only started six games. \nRoethlisberger and Bledsoe started most of their games, but not all of them.  \n \nSince this examination there have been 20 first-round quarterbacks from 2013-19 (not counting the past two years, so \nthere’s a cushion for acclimation time) and 12 (60%) of them are qualifies to these standards: Kyler Murray, Baker \nMayfield, Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Deshaun Watson, Lamar Jackson, Jared Goff, Carson Wentz, Jameis Winston, Marcus \nMariota, Mitchell Trubisky, and Blake Bortle",

Even so, the Eagles, \nChiefs, Bears, and Texans have shown that offenses with collegiate system influences can help quarterbacks do just that.  \n \nThe table above shows how a lot has changed with the quarterback position and offenses in a short period:  \n \n• \n83 percent of the 12 best rookie quarterback seasons have occurred since 2011. \n• \n83 percent of the 12 best seasons have happened after 2007.  \n• \nAll of the top-five fantasy seasons came in the past 10 years. \n• \nFour of the players on this list have seven Super Bowl appearances and three championships.  \n• \nTwo of those top five seasons were from quarterbacks with at least 700 yards rushing and 3,000 yards passing. \n• \nThe top-five rookie performers scored at least five rushing touchdowns.  \n• \nAll five threw for at least 20 touchdowns.  \n \nI didn’t believe we’d see a huge influx of quarterbacks with game-breaking skills on the ground, but we’re already seeing a \nbroader definition of what makes a top quarterback prospect.

Jalen Milroe is a good bet to join them in a year or two.  \n \nThe marquee talents, according to projected draft capital, in this year’s class are a mix of traditional drop-back passers, \npocket passers with enough athletic ability to run for big plays (gains of 15-30 yards), and a breakaway runner with a \ndecent arm in Daniels.   \n \nTeams can make it easier—and prevent early failures that kill the player’s potential too soon—with the help of a good \nscheme. However, there’s a point beyond the first 12-18 games of a player’s career that the defenses knock the training \nwheels off. \n \nOne of the players on this top rookie scorer list is still in the league but isn’t an NFL starter (Winston). Mayfield has revived \nhis career. Wilson is entering journeyman status, but still capable.   \n \nAt this point, the quarterback must show that he’s more than a product of his system and his surrounding talent.

Mayfield's career revival shows adaptability. Wilson's transition to journeyman status shows that even established quarterbacks can face decline.  The text suggests that success beyond early-career performance requires proving oneself independent of system and surrounding talent.\n\n* **Overall:** The NFL seems to be improving its quarterback development systems, but that's only half the battle; individual talent and adaptation remain crucial.\n\n\n**Missing Information:** The text lacks the depth to provide specific NFL player comparisons for any of the quarterbacks discussed, beyond broad generalizations about their playing styles.

Higher draft picks are more likely to start and maintain starting roles, regardless of talent.  However, players drafted later who *do* secure starting roles often perform comparably to their higher-drafted counterparts, indicating that draft capital isn't the sole predictor of success.  Russell Wilson and Dak Prescott are cited as exceptions to the general trend of poor performance from later-round rookie starters.\n\n* **Rookie Quarterback Production:**  Rookie quarterbacks, regardless of draft position, are generally inconsistent performers. The statistics show considerable variation in passing yards, touchdowns, and interceptions, with later rounds generally exhibiting lower production.  The text cautions against relying on rookie quarterbacks for consistent production.\n\n* **Average Performance by Round:** The data shows a clear drop-off in average production from Round 1 to subsequent rounds.  Round 1 quarterbacks, on average, significantly out-perform those drafted in later rounds. However, the exceptions mentioned (Prescott and Wilson) highlight that the lower rounds can produce high-performing quarterbacks, albeit less frequently.\n\nIn short, the text emphasizes the importance of opportunity linked to draft position while acknowledging that talented quarterbacks can emerge from any round.  Without individual player data, specific comparisons and strengths/weaknesses cannot be addressed.\n"

We’ve seen players become the darlings of the NFL for a season only \nto disappoint for the remainder of their careers. Derek Anderson and Steve Slaton come to mind immediately.  \n \nBut there was a wide enough gap between Prescott’s rookie performance in Dallas and my assessment of him at Mississippi \nState to motivate me to revisit my evaluation. There appeared to be a logical explanation for Prescott’s first month.  \n \nWithout Dez Bryant early on, the Cowboys told Prescott to play a safe two-man game with Jason Witten and Cole Beasley \nagainst the short and intermediate zones. After all, 12-yard runs and 16-yard passes constitute explosive plays in the NFL. \nAccording to research from Packers’ former Head of Research and Development Mike Eayrs, teams with just one explosive \nplay during a drive score 29 percent of the time. That rate of success jumps to 77 percent with two. Without a 12-yard run \nor 16-yard pass, an offense’s rate of scoring drops to 9 percent.  \n \nWith Dallas’ excellent offensive line, Ezekiel Elliott’s skills, and two excellent middle-of-the-field receivers, it only made \nsense that the Cowboys could successfully minimize high-risk plays, pound defenses, keep its defense fresh, and keep \ngames close into the fourth quarter. This is especially true when most NFL teams have a gap of four weeks before scouts’ \nfirst set of advanced reports on the rest of the NFL turn up in a coach’s office. \n \n\n \n17 \nThe Erhardt-Perkins Offense was also a convenient factor. Simpler to learn than the West Coast Offense, Dak Prescott’s \nconceptual transition wasn’t as imposing as what Jared Goff faced. Dallas’ surrounding talent was also markedly better. As \nfor Carson Wentz? He played in a WCO in college, which made the transition to the Eagles’ WCO a good fit.

His quick transition to the Erhardt-Perkins offense, compared to the struggles of other quarterbacks with more complex systems, is also noted as a strength.  Implicitly, his decision-making under pressure and game management are suggested as strengths due to his success within this controlled offensive scheme.\n\n* **Opportunities:** The text suggests that Prescott’s true potential was masked initially by a conservative game plan designed to minimize risks.  Further opportunities are implied by the team's overall talent which allows him to potentially flourish in a more expansive offense.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:** No direct comparisons are made in this excerpt.  The text uses other quarterbacks (Jared Goff, Carson Wentz) to illustrate contrasting situations and offensive schemes, but not as direct comparisons to Prescott's playing style or trajectory.

As I’ve observed this \nrelatively new Depth of Talent grading scale over the years, I’ve found that a score of 75 or higher is usually a player with \nthe materials to develop into a long-term starter.  \n \nIt’s a reasonable score. Even if his career had taken a nosedive (or if he never saw the starting lineup in the first place), I \nbelieve the score would have been a more logical, defensible evaluation. \n \nBecause the grade I had for him in 2016 was so much lower than his actual performance in unexpected playing time as a \nrookie, it helped me discover gaps in my process that I otherwise might not have seen and attributed to years of \ndevelopment.  \n \nIn many respects, these factors were similar to my experience analyzing Russell Wilson.

Describing my \nrankings process should also provide additional insight and usefulness to the fantasy owner. I want my readers to see some \nof the nuance behind the ranking of a player.  \n \nRankings Creation \n \nThe first step is watching football. I watch hundreds of games each year—recorded broadcasts, individual cutups produced \non YouTube, in recent years an extensive resource of All-22 film. I grade players in each session with a checklist of criteria.  \n \nI try to grade a player at least twice and this year the average games graded is usually 2-4 times that amount. In many \ncases, I grade 8-10 games. Still, what’s more important to me than the number of games is the amount of touches, \nattempts, or targets that I can see in a game. I’m seeking the greatest variety of scenarios that the player has experienced.  \n \nWhile it will always remain a work in progress—that’s the nature of process improvement—there are years of work behind \nthe RSP grading system. I don’t have to think as hard about how I grade a player, because the process is defined well \nenough for me to follow it without questioning it all the time. The questions I do have come about as an organic part of the \nprocess and they’re helpful in making the RSP a better publication. \n \nThe overall grade on this checklist is what I call a Breadth of Talent Score. This is an assessment of a player’s physical, \nmental, and technical skills that meet the baseline requirements of an NFL player at his position. The higher the score, the \nless fundamental work he must do to meet the bro",

The score does not indicate how well the player performs the criteria on \nthe checklist. This is where the Skill Breakdown comes into play (see the next section for more information).  \n \nI place each player in tiers for each category of the Skill Breakdown report. All tiers are defined in a manner to differentiate \nlevels of skill. I also note the ease and/or difficulty required to improve each facet of that player’s game. This exercise gives \nme insight into whether the player’s current depth of skill is at, above, or below the acceptable NFL baseline.  \n \nEach tier has a weight number, and the sum of these tiers is the Depth of Talent Score.

I evaluate these players on their short, \nintermediate, and deep accuracy, and their accuracy on the move.  \n \nNFL-caliber accuracy is significantly more demanding than what is acceptable for a college quarterback.

Throwing the ball to an area where the receiver can make an adjustment to the pass in tight coverage—“throwing \na receiver open”—has also become a common expectation.  \n \nArm strength—or velocity—might be the skill most overrated by the average fan.

Good short-to-intermediate accuracy overall.\n* **Opportunities/Weaknesses:**  Significant struggles with vertical and deep accuracy.

His sideline accuracy in the intermediate range is slightly below average.\n* **NFL Player Comparison:**  The text doesn't offer a direct comparison, but his profile suggests a quarterback who excels in short-to-intermediate routes but lacks the arm talent and consistency for deep throws.  He might be compared to a game manager who needs a strong running game and consistent short passing success to succeed, potentially with limitations in downfield attack capabilities.\n\n\n**Other Quarterbacks (brief mentions):**\n\n* **Jalen Milroe, Will Howard, Shough, Rourke, and Ward:** Showed above-average accuracy on sideline throws in the 28-42 yard range.

The analysis relies heavily on the categorization provided in the text.\n\n\n**Group 1: High Football IQ**\n\n* **Jalen Milroe & Cam Ward:**  Strengths lie in their ability to integrate physical and conceptual skills.  They possess high football intelligence, potentially leading to scheme-transcendent play in the NFL with further development.  **NFL Comparisons:**  Difficult to provide specific comparisons without more detailed individual scouting reports.  Their potential suggests a comparison to mobile quarterbacks who excel in reading defenses.\n\n**Group 2: Classic Pocket Passers**\n\n* **Shedeur Sanders, Kurtis Rourke, Tyler Shough, Quinn Ewers, Kyle McCord, Max Brosmer, Seth Henigan, Jaxson Dart:** Strengths are their pocket passing abilities, well-suited for play-action offenses.  They may lack the physical tools for all offensive systems.  **NFL Comparisons:**  Could be compared to game-managing quarterbacks who excel in structured offenses, potentially similar to less mobile versions of Drew Brees or Matt Ryan (depending on individual skill sets).\n\n**Group 3: West Coast Friendly**\n\n* **All 12 prospects:**  This category emphasizes quickness, accuracy, and potential for short-passing offenses with designed rollouts and boots.  Size and durability may be a concern for some. **NFL Comparisons:**  Potentially similar to quarterbacks who thrive in West Coast systems, such as Russell Wilson (though mobility varies across this group).\n\n**Group 4: Spread Offenses with High Doses of Read-Option Plays**\n\n* **Cam Ward, Jalen Milroe, Will Howard, Tyler Shough, Jaxson Dart, Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel, Seth Henigan:**  These quarterbacks need to balance strong passing skills with running ability. Quick decision-making is key. **NFL Comparisons:** This group is diverse, possibly comparing to quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson (for the most mobile) or Justin Fields (depending on their passing vs. rushing dominance).\n\n**Group 5: Deep-Ball Promise**\n\n* **Cam Ward, Jalen Milroe, Will Howard, Tyler Shough, Shedeur Sanders:**  Strengths are velocity, accuracy, and anticipation on deep throws. **NFL Comparisons:** Could be similar to strong-armed quarterbacks known for their deep ball, like Patrick Mahomes (though consistency and overall skillsets will differ).\n\n\n**Important Note:**  The provided text is insufficient for a truly in-depth analysis of each quarterback.

This comparison suggests Ward possesses both the potential for high-level play (Burrow) and the risk of inconsistency or inaccuracy (Manziel and Wilson).  The multi-dimensional nature of the comparison acknowledges the complexities of projecting NFL success. The comparison is not a direct 1:1 match to any single player, highlighting the potential upsides and downsides of his profile.\n* **Overall Depth of Talent Score:** 79.425  indicates he could be a rotational starter, but his ceiling may be limited.

He can make most, if not all, of the throws from the pocket that NFL coaches want in their \noffense and use a variety of throwing platforms to do so.  \n \nWard manipulates defenders with well-executed ball fakes in the play-action game as well as pump fakes in and outside the pocket. The \nplay-action game is where Ward exhibited the most cohesive and fluid aspects of drop footwork.  \n \nWhen dropping from pistol and shotgun, Ward’s footwork is fragmented in pacing and fluidity of steps. It doesn’t look good, but it hasn’t \nkilled his timing thus far. While that might prove the case when Ward transitions to the NFL, it’s likely that he’ll need to refine his footwork.  \n \nIf Ward doesn’t display clean, organized, and fluid drop footwork in game action this summer, it may be a compelling enough reason to \nkeep Ward on the bench and give him time to develop the technique that will be the foundation for everything he does as a decision-maker \nand thrower in the passing game.

Keeping his cleats \nin the ground as he throws the ball can enhance his velocity and placement.

His accuracy on intermediate throws requires refinement.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** No direct comparison is given in the text.  His strengths suggest a potential for high upside, but his weaknesses indicate a need for significant coaching and development.  A comparison might be a player with a strong arm and athleticism but needing refinement in decision-making and mechanics (e.g., a young, raw quarterback with high potential but needing time).\n\n\n**Jalen Milroe:**\n\n* **Strengths:** Ranked as the RSP's QB2.  The text doesn't detail specific strengths, but his high ranking implies a strong overall skillset. His Depth of Talent Score (78.975) suggests high potential.\n\n* **Opportunities/Weaknesses:** No specific weaknesses are detailed.  The comparison spectrum hints at a blend of abilities.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** Jalen Hurts and Malik Willis. This suggests a quarterback with both running and passing ability, but with a range of potential outcomes depending on development.  The comparison implies both high upside (Hurts) and potential inconsistency (Willis).\n"

Frequently overshoots targets, even when attempting to add air. His fade routes are too flat, giving defenders a chance to intercept.  Needs work on throws into Cover 2 zones and back-shoulder throws.\n* **Lower Body Mechanics:**  Needs improvement in his lower body mechanics to improve accuracy and ball placement.\n* **Decision Making Consistency:** While showing promise, he could hold his eyes on the initial read for slightly longer to improve his decision-making process.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nA direct comparison is difficult without more information, but based on the strengths and weaknesses, he could be compared to a mobile quarterback with a strong arm who needs refinement in their accuracy and touch.  Potentially a young version of **Lamar Jackson** (strong arm, mobile, but needs refinement in accuracy and decision-making), but also shows elements of **Josh Allen** (strong arm, but needs work on consistency and touch).  The comparison is very early-stage though.  More data would be needed to narrow it down.\n"

Needs to improve his ability to assess the entire field post-snap, especially on deeper crossing routes.\n* **Decision-Making Under Pressure:**  While aggressive, he occasionally hesitates or makes overly cautious decisions (e.g., pulling down the ball on a seemingly open vertical route due to concerns about a deep safety).  He needs to trust his reads and make quicker, more decisive throws.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  A potential comparison could be **Josh Allen** (strong arm, mobile, aggressive but prone to occasional mistakes).  However, it’s important to note that Milroe is still developing and this comparison is based on a limited sample of his play.  Another, less flashy, but potentially more accurate comparison might be **Lamar Jackson** before he refined his decision-making process in the NFL, highlighting both the strong points and weaknesses in his skillset.\n"

His velocity appears consistently high across all throw types.  He demonstrates strong accuracy on short routes (middle, flat, sideline) from both on and off-platform throws.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:** His accuracy significantly drops on deeper throws, both on and off-platform.  While he has some attempts at deep throws, the high inaccuracy rate suggests this area needs significant improvement.  There are also instances of inaccuracy on intermediate throws (flat and sideline) when off platform. The data doesn't offer insight into decision-making, pocket presence, or other critical QB skills.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:** Based solely on the limited accuracy data provided, a direct comparison is difficult.  However, his apparent strength in short to intermediate accuracy could be compared to quarterbacks known for their precision in quick passing games.  His struggles with deep throws might suggest a need for development similar to quarterbacks who have overcome early deep ball inconsistencies.  More comprehensive information (e.g., game film, arm strength, athleticism) is necessary for a more meaningful comparison.  A possible, but tentative, comparison might be a young quarterback with a strong short game but developing deep ball accuracy.  Examples could be a less mobile version of  Russell Wilson earlier in his career (with the caveat that Wilson always possessed elite athleticism), before he fully developed his downfield passing.  This comparison should be considered highly speculative due to the limited data provided.\n"

However, Sanders' potential weaknesses with late-game decisions and deep ball accuracy separates him from Wilson's prime.\n* **Lamar Jackson (with caveats):** The scrambling ability and off-platform accuracy align.

        "analysis": "The provided text analyzes a quarterback, referred to as \"Sanders,\" focusing primarily on his mobility and arm talent, rather than offering a comprehensive evaluation.  There is no mention of leadership qualities or intangibles. Here's a summary:\n\n\n**Sanders - Quarterback Analysis**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Mobility:** Sanders possesses impressive short-area quickness, allowing him to evade pressure and extend plays. He can effectively move in the pocket, buying time to throw and even utilizing his legs to gain yardage. His ability to move laterally is a significant asset.  He demonstrates the ability to throw accurately while on the move, both left and right.  He shows a strong arm, capable of completing long passes (up to 50 yards) with catchable accuracy, even under pressure.  He can effectively throw to the opposite boundary.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:** Sanders exhibits inconsistency in his decision-making, particularly in the red zone, where he has made costly mistakes including interceptions. His ability to read defenses, especially safety rotations, needs improvement, as evidenced by several missed opportunities and poor leverage reads.  Sometimes he throws the ball away when retreating, potentially indicating a lack of confidence in making a play under pressure.\n* **Pocket Presence:** While mobile, his restart quickness after changing direction is not a notable strength, and he can be reckless in the pocket at times.  \n* **Durability:** No significant injuries are reported, a positive aspect of his profile.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe text explicitly compares Sanders to a \"slow Kyler Murray,\" highlighting his mobility but acknowledging a difference in speed.  The reference to Mayfield and Smith suggests a potential for similar career trajectories (perhaps inconsistent performance or late-round draft status followed by inconsistent NFL success).  This comparison doesn't necessarily indicate a high ceiling but implies the potential for a middling NFL career with some level of success in specific areas.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nSanders presents a fascinating but incomplete prospect.  His athleticism and arm talent are considerable strengths, but his decision-making and consistency need significant improvement. His NFL success will largely hinge on his ability to refine his pocket awareness and reduce risky plays. His draft stock remains uncertain, and his value largely depends on team fit and draft capital.\n"

The charting data shows strong completion percentages in those areas.\n* **Manipulative skill:** He demonstrates the ability to manipulate defenders, using his movement to create throwing lanes and set up targets.\n* **Scrambling ability:**  Rourke shows the capacity to reverse field as a scrambler and still complete passes, especially to the opposite boundary.\n* **Red-zone capability:** He displays some aptitude in the red zone, although inconsistent, with examples of fade throws and accurate vertical placement.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Consistency:** His accuracy suffers off-platform and on deeper throws, particularly on vertical sideline throws (36.4% inaccurate).  This inconsistency needs improvement.\n* **Red-zone struggles:** While he can execute red-zone throws, he also has a history of botching snaps in the red zone, indicating a need for improved execution under pressure.\n* **Limited sample size:** The analysis is based on a limited number of plays, so the conclusions are subject to change with more data.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe report provides a comparison spectrum ranging from Trent Edwards and Joey Harrington (less mobile, pocket passers with arm talent) to Josh Rosen (talented but inconsistent) and Brad Kaaya (similar arm strength and accuracy but often struggled with decision-making).

        "analysis": "The provided text focuses heavily on quantitative data (passing percentages by throw location) rather than qualitative analysis of Kurtis Rourke's skills.  Therefore, a comprehensive summary highlighting strengths, opportunities, and NFL comparisons is limited. However, based on the available information:\n\n\n**Kurtis Rourke:**\n\n* **Strengths (Inferred):**  The data suggests Rourke is capable of making accurate throws across various depths and locations, particularly on short and intermediate routes.  His high completion percentage on short and intermediate throws indicates good accuracy and decision-making in those situations.  His relatively low interception rate (5 interceptions for 29 touchdowns) points towards good ball security.  The \"elevator pitch\" mentions promising work as a pocket passer, which implies a good base for NFL development.  His recovery from a torn ACL and subsequent strong season are testaments to his resilience and work ethic.\n\n* **Opportunities:**  The data lacks information on deep ball accuracy, which is crucial for NFL success.  Further analysis of his gameplay (e.g., film study) is needed to assess his arm strength, pocket presence under pressure, and overall athleticism outside of the limited \"mobile\" category mention.   His draft position offers the chance to land with a team willing to develop his game further.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:**  The lack of detailed analysis prevents concrete comparisons.  However, based on the hinted-at strengths (accuracy, good decision-making, pocket passing),  a *potential* comparison might be a quarterback who excels in short-to-intermediate passing schemes, but requires development of their deep ball accuracy.  This is too vague to name specific players, though.\n\n\n**In conclusion:** The text provides a glimpse into Rourke's accuracy and efficiency on shorter throws, showcasing potential but needing much more detailed analysis to offer a complete evaluation and meaningful NFL comparisons.  More information beyond the provided statistics is needed for a robust assessment.\n"

        "analysis": "**Connor Rourke**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy and Mechanics:**  Possesses excellent accuracy, particularly downfield (40-45 yards, potentially further), due to clean footwork and a compact, efficient release.  He shows an advanced understanding of manipulating defenders with his eyes and pre-snap reads to create throwing lanes.  His placement is exceptional, allowing receivers to make contested catches in tight windows.\n* **Pocket Mobility and Improvisation:** While not a top-end athlete as a runner, he displays good pocket movement, buys time with his legs, and extends plays effectively. He has a feel for pressure and utilizes his mobility to create opportunities.\n* **Mental Processing:** Demonstrates an ability to work through multiple reads, quickly process information, reset his feet after pressure, and make accurate throws. He understands defensive schemes and anticipates coverage adjustments.\n* **High-Level College Performance:**  Had a standout senior season with impressive statistics (3,042 yards, 29 TDs, 5 INTs), a top-five national QB rating, and helped his team reach the playoffs in a tough conference.\n\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n* **Deep Ball Consistency:** While his accuracy extends to 40-45 yards, consistently hitting deep throws with precision will be key to his NFL success. Demonstrating the ability to make these throws with higher velocity and against NFL-level defenses is important.\n* **Physical Tools:** While his pocket mobility is a strength, improving his overall athleticism could make him even more dynamic.\n* **NFL Level Competition:** Transitioning to the NFL involves significantly faster, stronger, and more technically refined players on both sides of the ball.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nBased on the provided text, Rourke's skillset suggests a comparison to quarterbacks who combine accuracy, pocket presence, and improvisational ability.

However, Wilson's athleticism is arguably a higher level than Rourke's.\n* **A more mobile version of Kirk Cousins:** Cousins is known for his accuracy and ability to read defenses but is less mobile than Rourke. Rourke's added mobility and play-extending capabilities differentiate him.\n\n\nIt's important to note that these are tentative comparisons based on limited information.  More in-depth scouting and pre-draft evaluations would be needed to solidify these comparisons or identify others.\n"

He's adept at using his mobility to extend plays and create opportunities downfield.\n* **Accuracy (under pressure):**  He shows the ability to deliver accurate throws even while facing pressure, including on the move, and can lead receivers away from defenders.\n* **Decision-Making (Situational):**  Rourke displays a good feel for when to leave the pocket and when to wait for routes to develop, even taking hits to deliver accurate throws to open receivers.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Accuracy (under pressure):** While generally accurate under pressure, he has instances where he forces throws into tight coverage, leading to potential turnovers.\n* **Decision-Making (Overall):**  The tendency to force throws into coverage highlights a need for improved decision-making in high-pressure situations.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nBased on the provided text, Rourke's skillset suggests a comparison to mobile quarterbacks known for their ability to extend plays and make accurate throws while under pressure.  Examples could include:\n\n* **Lamar Jackson (early career):**  Both possess exceptional mobility and the ability to create plays outside of structure.  However, Jackson's overall arm strength and throwing consistency may be superior to what is implied about Rourke.\n* **Josh Allen (early career):** Similar in terms of arm strength, but Rourke's pocket awareness and evasiveness may be more refined in comparison to Allen's early development.  Allen's overall power and stature are likely greater.\n* **Russell Wilson (earlier in his career):**  Wilson also relied on exceptional mobility and quick reads to create plays, though Rourke may need to prove himself more consistently as a passer.\n\n\n**Note:**  The comparison is tentative due to the limited information provided. A fuller evaluation would require more extensive game film and statistical data.\n"

When pushed, he \ncan do what he does elsewhere – throw the ball with pinpoint accuracy within a range of 25-30 yards.  \nOpposite-Hash Accuracy: Dart’s shallow accuracy is stellar. His intermediate accuracy is a mix of pinpoint and catchable.

His short- and intermediate accuracy was more \npinpoint than catchable. His vertical and deep accuracy were lacking.  \nDecision-Making: Dart can work through 2-3 reads during a play, legitimately seeing what’s in front of him with each of the \nprogressions. He can work from one sideline to the next before checking the ball to the outlet. He can do so before pressure arrives \nin the pocket.  \nDart illustrates wise game management in the red zone.

He identifies pre-snap pressure—inside \nand outside—and he responds effectively to interior pressure and edge pressure. He’s also effective against some forms of pressure where \nthere are multiple players arriving at the same time from different points of the pocket.  \nDart can be a step late to read a Green Dog blitz from the same side as an edge blitz and it costs him 1-2 steps to avoid it.  \nManeuvering From Pressure: Dart climbs the pocket with hitches to work away from compressed edges of the pocket.

He's particularly accurate on short throws while moving.  He shows an ability to avoid sacks and extend plays.\n* **Accuracy:**  Possesses pinpoint accuracy on short and intermediate routes, even from off-platform throws and while moving, especially to the opposite hash. He demonstrates the ability to lead receivers away from boundaries.  He is thoughtful about receiver protection in his throws.\n\n**Opportunities/Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **Accuracy Under Pressure (Long Range):**  While accurate in short to intermediate ranges when moving, his accuracy and velocity suffer on throws over 25 yards when sidestepping pressure; his footwork widens, hindering his throws.\n* **Decision-Making:** He occasionally wastes energy scrambling for short gains when checking down early would have been a safer, potentially equally effective play.  This suggests a need for improved pre-snap reads and decision-making.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  Impossible to provide a concrete comparison without more data on other quarterbacks and a broader assessment of Dart's skills (e.g., arm strength, deep ball accuracy, leadership).  However, his mobility and accuracy on short to intermediate throws might evoke comparisons to mobile quarterbacks who excel in quick-passing offenses, but his current limitations in deep accuracy under pressure suggest he isn't yet at the level of top tier mobile QBs.\n"

Instead, he attempts to work inside, it’s 3rd and short, and he’s too far from the line of scrimmage to try for the gain.  \nScrambling: Dart can avoid two points of pressure in the pocket and work in or outside the pocket to buy time.

        "analysis": "**Analysis of Quarterback \"Dart\"**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Evasive Scrambling:** Dart excels at avoiding pressure, displaying patience in the pocket before initiating evasive maneuvers. He's adept at navigating both single and multiple rushers, though he struggles slightly when pressure comes from multiple directions simultaneously.  He possesses the agility to make defenders miss in the open field, transitioning smoothly between perimeter and downhill runs. His ability to create yardage where none seemingly exists is a significant asset.\n* **Running Ability:** Dart is a dynamic runner with impressive speed and elusiveness. He demonstrates good ball carrying technique (head-first or feet-first slides), effectively using his lower body to break tackles. He can consistently gain significant yardage and power through tackles, even against safeties. His ability to bounce off contact and maintain forward momentum is noteworthy.\n* **Quick Decision-Making (in running situations):**  He transitions rapidly between running lanes, showing quick reactions and decisive movement.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making (in passing situations):**  Dart needs improvement in his pocket presence and decision-making when passing. He sometimes holds onto the ball too long in unfavorable situations, resulting in negative plays.  He should prioritize checking down early in obvious disadvantageous coverage rather than forcing plays. He also needs to improve his ball security, especially when scrambling, as he has a tendency to carry the ball loosely.\n* **Pocket Awareness:** While his scrambling ability is a strength, his tendency to hold onto the ball too long while scrambling, particularly when pressured from one side, limits his effectiveness as a passer.  He needs to improve his judgment of when to throw the ball away or take a sack to avoid turnovers.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nDart's skillset blends elements of several NFL quarterbacks.  His scrambling ability and elusiveness evoke comparisons to players like **Lamar Jackson** (though without the same level of consistent passing accuracy) and **Josh Allen** (in terms of running ability, but again, with less refined passing skills). However, his need for improvement in pocket presence and decision-making suggests he is not yet at the level of those elite dual-threat quarterbacks.  His style might eventually resemble a more mobile version of a quarterback like **Kyler Murray**, highlighting both potential brilliance and a need for more consistent decision-making.  The comparison is heavily weighted towards his running style, however, as the description lacks detail on his arm strength, accuracy and passing mechanics.\n"

Here's a summary:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Running Ability:** Dart isn't a breakaway runner, but he's effective at gaining 15-30 yard chunks, showcasing strength and the ability to bounce off tackles.  He's a better runner than just a chain-mover.\n* **Arm Strength and Vertical Accuracy (with caveats):**  He possesses good arm strength and vertical accuracy *when given a clean pocket*.  The analysis highlights examples of strong throws, including layered throws over linebackers.\n* **Pocket Movement:** Dart shows some ability to move within the pocket to evade pressure and make throws.\n* **Red Zone Prowess:**  The analysis mentions examples of good red zone decision-making and accurate throws.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Accuracy Consistency:** Dart struggles with accuracy inconsistencies, particularly when his drop steps/timing are off or when his throwing platform is compromised (e.g., wide stance limiting accuracy).  He needs a clean runway for his deep throws to be consistently effective.\n* **Game Management:** While showing flashes of wisdom, the text indicates a need for improvement in game management, especially under pressure.  The examples given suggest occasional poor decisions.\n* **Durability:** While having recovered well from a meniscus injury, his past injury is a concern.\n* **Throwing Mechanics:** Using his throwing shoulder to absorb hits instead of sliding is cited as a potentially detrimental habit.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**  The text doesn't provide explicit NFL comparisons. However, based on the analysis, Dart could be compared to a mobile quarterback with a strong arm but accuracy inconsistencies, perhaps a less polished version of a player like Josh Allen (strong arm, mobile but accuracy issues early in career) or even a less powerful version of Lamar Jackson (mobile, but relies on a clean pocket for deep passes).  The comparison is heavily dependent on Dart's improvement in consistency and game management.\n"

Squint hard enough and you’ll see some of the things that made Jay Cutler a compelling prospect early \nin his career. \n \nRight now, that potential is a projection more than a reality. Shough’s vertical and deep accuracy is catchable a lot more often than it is \npinpoint. His arm slots influence this dip in accuracy. When forced to place air under the ball from an off-balanced platform on a deep \ntarget, he should be leading the target away from the deep safety. \nMore important than his arm talent is the gaps with Shough’s decision-making. He must improve his recognition of early opportunities the \ndefense shows, opportunities that are superior to the predetermined decisions he chooses. \n \nShough’s manipulation of the Cover 3 safety must be savvier. He tips off the defender because he’s staring down the safety rather than \nlooking to the opposite side of the field if not influence the defender to slide opposite the intended route.  \nHe can also be 1-2 steps late with executing the viable decision he identifies at the right time, but lacks the confidence to trust with \npressure arriving. This leads to throwing the ball in the middle of the field from an off-platform position and under pressure to a target that \nis no longer open.  \nShough’s lateness as a decision maker can also lead to him taking sacks he could have avoided.

For instance, against a T-E twist, \nShough will see the linebackers and safeties taking deep drops and leaving a lot of room underneath for the running back circling \nout of the backfield to the middle of the field.  \nThe back is breaking at the same depth as Shough’s predetermined read to the opposite flat. Instead of targeting this back who is \ndirectly in his sightline during the drop, Shough delivers the opposite-field out that requires a more challenging late turn and throw \nfrom Shough and the ball takes more time to reach the receiver and gives the defense more time to recover space.  \nWhen sprinting out under pressure, Shough does well to look for an open option. If that option isn’t open and a defender is closing, \nit’s best to target the deeper boundary route with a throw out of bounds. Instead, Shough considers a cross-body throw with two \ndefenders in position to defend the target and pressure closing. By the time he pulls the ball down with a second pump fake, the \ndefender is on top of him and sacking.  \nWhen staying in the pocket under pressure, Shough is not as resistant to throwing the ball away. He ‘ll do it as needed when \nreceivers don’t break open and pressure is bearing down.  \nShough can be 1-2 steps late with executing the decision he sees but lacked the confidence to trust with pressure arriving. This \nleads to throwing the ball in the middle of the field from an off-platform position under pressure to a target that is no longer open, \nor throwing the ball away, but near the receiver he could have hit 1-2 steps earlier.  \nHis black-zone management – working i",
        "analysis": "**Shough's Summary:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Intermediate Accuracy (Moving Left):**  Shows decent accuracy on intermediate throws when moving to his left, both in and out of the pocket.\n* **Pressure Handling (To a Degree):**  Willing to take hits to deliver on-time throws under pressure, and shows a tendency to throw the ball away when necessary while in the pocket.  He is better at finding open options while scrambling.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:** Prone to predetermining throws, missing easier, higher-percentage options in favor of more difficult throws.  This leads to missed opportunities and sacks.  He hesitates, leading to late throws under pressure, resulting in inaccurate throws or sacks.\n* **Pocket Awareness/Pressure Reaction:** While he sometimes throws the ball away, he often reacts to pressure instead of anticipating it and making quick, decisive throws. This results in sacks and missed opportunities.  He struggles to consistently make quick, decisive throws under pressure.\n* **Confidence:** Lacks the confidence to trust his initial reads, sometimes waiting too long before making a decision, which negatively impacts his play.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**  A potential comparison might be a less-refined, more inconsistent version of a quarterback like **Russell Wilson** (early career) in terms of scrambling ability and arm talent, but significantly lacking in the decision-making and pocket presence aspects.  Another comparison, focusing on the weaknesses, could be a quarterback who struggles with pre-snap reads and pocket awareness, such as a less polished version of **Sam Darnold**. The comparison hinges heavily on whether he can improve his decision-making and confidence.\n"

He might be compared to a player like a young, less accurate **Russell Wilson** (in terms of mobility and extending plays) but with the riskier decision-making tendencies of a less developed quarterback.   Another less flattering comparison, given his decision-making flaws, could be a more erratic  **Josh Allen** in his earlier years before refining his accuracy and decision making. The comparison depends heavily on if he can improve his accuracy and decision-making under pressure.\n"

        "analysis": "**Summary of Quarterback Howard:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Mobility and Pocket Awareness:** Howard possesses excellent mobility, effectively escaping pressure from various angles (interior, edge, blitz). He shows a good feel for pressure pre-snap and post-snap, and utilizes effective evasion techniques (climbing, hitching, sidestepping, stop-start moves).  He can deliver accurate throws on the run.\n* **Play-Action:** He's improved his play-action fakes, selling the exchange more convincingly.\n* **Pressure Identification:**  He identifies pressure well, both pre-snap and post-snap, from various sources.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Accuracy and Decision-Making:**  His accuracy suffers under pressure, leading to inaccurate throws and potential turnovers. He sometimes attempts throws into tight coverage, resulting in interceptions or near-interceptions.  He needs to improve his ability to throw the ball away in certain situations.  His anticipation on intermediate routes needs refinement; he often releases the ball too late.\n* **Leverage Reads:**  Improving his leverage reads and focusing on key defenders will significantly enhance his overall performance.\n* **Arrogance:** The report suggests that curbing his tendency to force throws (arrogance with his arm) is crucial for his development.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**\n\nBased on the provided information, a comparison could be drawn to a mobile quarterback with accuracy issues under pressure, potentially someone like a younger, less-accurate version of **Josh Allen** (before his significant accuracy improvement) or a more athletic **Marcus Mariota** – possessing the athletic upside but needing refinement in decision-making and accuracy to reach higher levels.  However,  it's important to note that this is a tentative comparison based on limited information.  A more comprehensive scouting report would be needed for a more accurate and precise comparison.\n"

He can also cycle through 1-2 reads and find the check-down in a timely manner. \nAs mentioned about his opposite-hash accuracy, Howard can target windows that may prove too tight for the NFL or target \nleverage that’s more favorable for an NFL defender than what he’s targeting successfully in college.

He senses pressure well and climbs the pocket effectively for extra yardage. Accounts for peripheral defenders on clean pocket throws from first reads.  Good at identifying pre and post-snap pressure from various sources (interior, edge, DBs).\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Accuracy under pressure and in tight windows:**  Struggles with throws into tight NFL-level windows and throws where the defender has favorable leverage.  He prioritizes quick throws even when better options exist downfield.\n* **Decision-making (specifically):** Prone to interceptions on quick screens due to overlooking defenders.  Tendency to get greedy on second reads, forcing throws instead of taking easy check-downs, especially when time exists for a pivot to the opposite field.  Doesn't consistently attack routes where defenders are squatting over the top.\n* **Pocket awareness:** While good at sensing pressure, he sometimes takes off too early from interior pressure.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nDue to the mix of strengths and weaknesses, a direct comparison is difficult.

Howard lacks Allen's arm talent, making his risky decisions more problematic.\n\nIn short, Howard is a project with intriguing mobility and accuracy but needs significant improvement in decision-making under pressure and consistently attacking better throwing windows to reach his potential. He needs to learn when to trust his instincts and when to take the safe option.\n"

To make a comparison, one would need to consider Ewers' strengths and weaknesses relative to current NFL quarterbacks.  His blend of play-action skills, efficient release, and potential for off-platform throws could be compared to quarterbacks who are mobile and adept at extending plays, potentially drawing comparisons (depending on further development) to quarterbacks like  Josh Allen (due to the mobility and arm strength), or even a more mobile version of Justin Herbert (due to the emphasis on efficient release and accuracy).

His accuracy and arm talent are reminiscent of **Patrick Mahomes** (though Mahomes' improvisation is currently more refined). His mobility and ability to extend plays could draw comparisons to **Josh Allen** or even **Lamar Jackson**, but his decision-making needs significant improvement before reaching that level.  A more conservative, but still accurate comparison might be **Russell Wilson** in his prime, noting Wilson's mobility and accuracy, while acknowledging Ewers' need for greater consistency and decision-making refinement.\n"

When \npressure pushes a running back into his lap, Brosmer will hang in there unless there’s additional interior pressure arriving unblocked. In this \ncase, Brosmer will spin and roll, but he’s not quick enough to get away with the roll.  \nBrosmer can reduce his shoulder, duck, and climb from pressure.

        "analysis": "**Brosmer: Quarterback Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy under pressure:**  Brosmer displays impressive accuracy even when pressured, both on and off-platform, with pinpoint throws up to 35 yards. His accuracy extends to throws across the field (up to 49 yards) and on the move (up to 30 yards).\n* **Pocket maneuvering:** He demonstrates the ability to subtly evade pressure through sliding, climbing, and ducking, creating throwing lanes.  He's willing to take hits to deliver the ball.\n* **Pre-snap awareness:** He identifies pressure pre-snap, particularly from the edge.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-making under pressure:** While he identifies pressure, he sometimes overreacts, leaving open receivers untargeted. He needs to better integrate pre-snap reads into his post-snap decisions, choosing available options rather than always trying to extend plays.\n* **Mobility limitations:** Although he can maneuver in the pocket, his mobility isn't exceptional.  His rollouts aren't always effective for escaping pressure.\n* **Receiver timing:**  Needs improved synchronization with receivers on route execution.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nGiven his accuracy under pressure and willingness to take hits, a potential comparison could be drawn to a quarterback like **Russell Wilson** (early career) or **Drew Brees** (in terms of accuracy). However, Brosmer's mobility limitations prevent a direct comparison to truly mobile quarterbacks.  A more apt comparison might be to a quarterback who excels with accuracy in the pocket but lacks elite athleticism.  The analysis doesn't provide enough information for a precise comparison.  A more accurate comparison would require evaluating his arm strength, leadership qualities and overall game management skills.\n"

When should the receiver \nsettle or continue his route. Brosmer has thrown interceptions because he expected one thing and the receiver did another.  \nBrosmer will take a sack when the passing lane to his check-down is blocked by an end and forcing the throw is risky. He’s good at \ntargeting the ball away from the leverage of the defenders covering the receiver. Even if he’s not pinpoint accurate under pressure \nwith some of these throws, the ball is only where the receiver can make the play—especially in the red zone.  \nAlthough the lapses are few, Brosmer has gotten greedy on 1st and 10 between the 20s where he passes up an easy shallow read \nwith space for the receiver to run and winds up taking a sack because the secondary reads weren’t open. This is important because \nin those situations there was clear pre-snap signs of pressure from the blindside, so it’s best to presume if the first read is open, \nthat’s all the time the QB will have.  \nLike most QBs, his accuracy wanes under pressure. Still, Brosmer makes enough layered throws downfield under pressure that it’s \npremature to write him off as a player who fizzles with defenders in his face.  \nScrambling: Brosmer typically beats one point of pressure. He’s not the type of athlete or refined mover to beat two or more points of \npressure unless it’s in a succession with that has some time between the two penetrating blitzers.  \nRunning: Brosmer can get outside the pocket and earn chain-moving gains. He will slide and if he can’t do this one time, he’ll dive under \nhits.  \nDurability: Torn ACL and torn LCL during career – LCL in high school.

He shows an ability to make layered throws downfield even under pressure.\n* **Red Zone Ability:**  Effective at placing the ball where only the receiver can make a play, particularly in the red zone.\n* **Pocket Mobility:** Can extend plays and gain yardage by moving outside the pocket.  He displays awareness to protect himself from hits (sliding, diving).\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:** Needs improvement in reading defenses and trusting his initial reads, particularly on first down between the 20s.  Sometimes becomes greedy and holds onto the ball too long, leading to sacks.  His timing with receivers needs to be more consistent to avoid interceptions.\n* **Pressure:** While he can make throws under pressure, his accuracy diminishes. He's effective against one blitzer but struggles against multiple simultaneous pressures.\n* **Durability:** History of significant knee injuries (ACL, LCL, meniscus tears) raises concerns about his long-term health.\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**\n\nFinding a direct comparison is difficult due to his inconsistencies, but he might be compared to a less mobile, less accurate version of a quarterback like **Russell Wilson** (strong arm, ability to extend plays but with a higher risk-taking profile and more inconsistency in accuracy and decision-making). Another, perhaps more fitting, comparison might be a quarterback with a similar arm and risk-reward profile like **Josh Allen** before his refinement, but again, lacking Allen's athleticism.  The injuries are a significant differentiator from most comparables.  His potential is high, but his risk is also significant.\n"

I saw two passes in four games where he accounted for a middle of the field defender and \nplaced the ball to protect his receiver. This was the Boston College game, so sequentially speaking, McCord is making progress in \nthis area.  \nMcCord can quickly move off his first read and fire to his second read in the shallow range.  \nOn sprint passes, McCord will throw the ball away when he doesn’t find open receivers to the play side and pressure forces him to \nretreat late in the sprint.  \nWhen McCord isn’t forcing targets in the red zone, he can work to his second read efficiently and place the ball where the receiver \nis the only one to make the catch.  \nMcCord can be overconfident targeting receivers at the boundary on fades where the corner has the receiver pinning to the \nboundary at the hip before the decision to throw. He must respect the leverage of the defender more.  \nSense Pressure: McCord senses edge pressure to the side of his throwing arm about 2-3 steps away. The same is true with interior \npressure. He identifies pre-snap edge pressure and adjusts to the potential of its arrival. \nManeuvering From Pressure: McCord will stand in the pocket and deliver with interior pressure coming downhill and hitting McCord as \nthe ball leaves his hand. When he senses edge pressure to his throwing arm’s side, he can retreat and roll to that right side. He’ll reset and \ndeliver a pinpoint vertical shot up the flat.  \nAgainst interior pressure, McCord will retreat, spin, and roll outside the pocket.

        "analysis": "This text analyzes the quarterback play of a player named McCord, focusing primarily on his accuracy and decision-making under pressure.  There's no information provided on other quarterbacks.  Here's a summary of McCord's analysis:\n\n**McCord:**\n\n* **Strengths:**\n    * **Accuracy under pressure:**  McCord demonstrates impressive accuracy, even while facing pressure, particularly on short and intermediate throws. He can hit receivers on back-shoulder throws, even at longer distances (38 yards).  He's capable of accurate throws from various platforms (on-platform, off his back foot, while rolling).\n    * **Pocket Mobility:** He can effectively use a two-step drop to avoid pressure and reset, or climb the pocket to keep plays alive. He can also deliver accurate passes while on the move.\n\n* **Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n    * **Overreliance on spin move:** McCord frequently uses a spin move to evade pressure, even when a pocket climb would be a more efficient option. This spin move can limit his field vision and increase the risk of sacks.  The effectiveness of the spin move is highly contextual, succeeding only when pressure is very close.\n    * **Risky throws:** While accurate, some of McCord's throws into tight windows are risky, resulting in potential interceptions if not caught cleanly. His off-platform throws tend to sail.\n    * **Decision-making:** The analysis explicitly states that McCord's decision-making regarding leverages isn't covered in this text. This suggests a potential area for improvement.\n\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:**  The provided text doesn't offer any specific NFL player comparisons.  To make comparisons, one would need more information on his size, arm strength, overall athleticism, and processing speed.  Based solely on the provided strengths and weaknesses, a speculative comparison might be drawn to a mobile quarterback with a strong arm but inconsistent decision-making.  However, this is highly speculative without additional data.\n"

The added factor of edge pressure to the play side influences McCord to force the target and he’ll do this in \nthe red zone where, at worst, taking the sack is a better alternative. To compound this issue, McCord didn’t learn from it the first \ntime. Later in the same game with the exact situation, he tried to force the target again.  \nWhen presented with two options in a similar area of the field and similar route depths, McCord eschews the route working back to \nhim with the defender at the receiver’s back. Instead, he attacks the route heading downfield into that same defender who can \ndeliver a dangerous hit to the receiver or cut off target easier. \n\n \n96 \nWhen interior pressure forces McCord to retreat, spin, and roll outside the pocket in the red zone, he takes a quick look at the \nreceivers in front of him and either targets them or throws the ball away.  \nHe has multiple passes deflected in games and of the contributing factors is him forcing targets on screens that aren’t well-\ndeveloped or they are well-covered.  \nScrambling: McCord can buy time versus one point of pressure and extend outside the pocket or break the pocket inside.  \nRunning: He has enough speed and quickness to roll outside interior pressure and sprint to the far sideline for a chain-moving gain. He’s \nnot sudden and he won’t make defenders miss with one-on-one situations. With multiple blocks downfield, McCord can weave through the \nopen field and generate a field-flipping gain as long as he doesn’t have to put a move on a defender to make them miss.

His mobility and arm talent could draw comparisons to quarterbacks like **Josh Allen** (in terms of athleticism and arm strength) but his decision-making needs significant improvement to reach that level.  Perhaps a more fitting, albeit less glamorous, comparison might be to a mobile quarterback with accuracy issues who needs coaching to reach their potential, someone like a less polished **Russell Wilson** (early career) or a less accurate **Lamar Jackson**.  The key difference is that McCord's weaknesses are far more pronounced in decision-making than either of these examples.\n"

        "analysis": "This text analyzes the quarterback play of a player named Henigan.  Here's a summary:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy:**  Excellent short-range accuracy, pinpoint accuracy to the opposite hash at 46 yards, and compelling deep accuracy to the opposite field.  Shows potential for intermediate accuracy.  Good accuracy even under pressure, with a 53-55-yard range to the near-side flat while taking a hit.\n* **Pocket Presence/Pressure Handling:**  Displays the willingness to stand in the pocket and deliver against oncoming pressure.  Shows advanced maneuvering skills, including late climbs to avoid pressure, sidestepping, and utilizing spin-and-roll maneuvers effectively.  He can avoid multiple pressure points.\n* **Ball Placement:**  Shows an understanding of using ball placement to protect receivers (back-shoulder throws).  Can layer throws over linebackers.\n* **Arm Strength:** Has demonstrated the ability to throw accurately to the opposite hash at 46 yards and deep to the opposite boundary at 46 yards.\n\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n\n* **Accuracy Under Pressure (Long Range):**  While accurate under pressure at shorter ranges,  long-range accuracy under pressure needs refinement.  He sometimes targets leverage favoring the defender rather than the receiver.\n* **Mobile Accuracy (Right-Side Rollouts):** Needs improved velocity and placement when rolling to his right, particularly at longer distances.\n* **Decision-Making:** While he monitors safety drops, further development in overall decision-making is implied.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nThe provided text doesn't offer explicit NFL player comparisons.  However, based on the strengths and weaknesses described, Henigan's game might show similarities to quarterbacks who possess:\n\n* **Accuracy and Pocket Presence (like a shorter range, more accurate version of):**  Russell Wilson (for his ability to make plays under pressure) or  Patrick Mahomes (for the athleticism and ability to extend plays).\n* **Areas for Improvement (similar to young QBs who need development):**  Justin Fields (in terms of needing to improve accuracy and consistency on the move).\n\nIt's important to note that these are speculative comparisons based on limited information. A more complete evaluation would be needed to make precise and accurate comparisons.\n"

        "analysis": "**Henigan: Quarterback Summary**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy:** Shows excellent accuracy on intermediate and deep throws, including pinpoint placement on deep shots to the opposite boundary.  His accuracy is noted even when climbing in the pocket or scrambling.\n* **Pocket Awareness/Mobility:** Demonstrates good pocket awareness, monitoring safeties and linebackers. He can effectively avoid pressure, sidestepping multiple rushers and climbing to deliver accurate throws. He's shown the ability to extend plays with his legs.\n* **Decision-Making (with caveats):**  He shows the ability to read defenses and progress through his reads. However, he has lapses in judgment, sometimes throwing the ball away when open receivers are available or forcing throws into tight windows.\n\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Decision-Making Consistency:**  Inconsistency in decision-making is his biggest weakness.  He needs to improve his ability to recognize open receivers, especially when under pressure, and avoid unnecessary throwaways.\n* **Risk-Taking:** While his aggressiveness can be a strength, it sometimes leads to poor decisions and interceptions (as evidenced by the example cited).  Balancing aggressiveness with smart decision-making is crucial.\n* **Running Style:** While he can move the chains and make plays with his legs, refining his sliding technique would protect him from unnecessary hits.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nHenigan's profile suggests a blend of attributes.  There isn't a perfect comparison, but aspects of his game could be reminiscent of quarterbacks like:\n\n* **Early-career Russell Wilson:**  Similar mobility and ability to extend plays, coupled with accuracy on intermediate and deep throws. However, Wilson's overall decision-making is significantly more refined.\n* **A less polished version of Patrick Mahomes:**  Both exhibit a willingness to take chances and make impressive throws outside the pocket.  However, Mahomes is a far superior overall passer and decision-maker at this stage.\n\n**Overall:**  Henigan possesses exciting physical tools and potential. However, he needs to significantly improve his decision-making consistency to become a successful NFL quarterback.  His ceiling is high, but the floor remains a significant concern due to his inconsistency.\n"

        "analysis": "**Dillon Gabriel**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Gabriel demonstrates excellent accuracy, particularly on short and intermediate throws, both on and off platform. He shows the ability to make pinpoint throws under pressure, even while taking a hit. He's aggressive in tight coverage and can manipulate defenders. He's capable of making game-winning throws.  His deep ball accuracy, while not as consistent as his shorter throws, still shows promise.\n\n* **Opportunities:** Gabriel's accuracy dips slightly on intermediate and deep throws. While he's aggressive, this sometimes leads to lapses in placement, favoring the defender's leverage. Improving consistency on throws beyond the short range will be crucial for his NFL success. Refining his decision-making under pressure, minimizing those placement errors, will further elevate his game.\n\n* **NFL Player Comparisons:**  The scouting report compares him to Drew Brees and Russell Wilson, suggesting a blend of accuracy (Brees) and mobility (Wilson).  However,  his current accuracy profile and depth of talent score (72.55, categorized as \"Reserve: Contributor with limitations\") indicate he may not reach the elite levels of those quarterbacks. The comparison serves more as a directional guideline, highlighting his potential rather than a definitive projection.  He might develop into a capable backup or game manager, with a ceiling potentially higher depending on his refinement and growth.\n"

        "analysis": "**Quarterback: Gabriel**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Accuracy:** Possesses exceptional arm strength and accuracy, capable of pinpoint throws of 48+ yards downfield.  Excellent ball placement, allowing receivers to make catches without taking big hits.  Can layer throws effectively over multiple coverage levels.\n* **Processing:**  Shows ability to progress through reads, working from first to third reads, identifying open receivers across the field, particularly against zone coverages (e.g., finding holes in Cover 3).  Can manipulate safeties with his drop and read progressions.\n* **Mobility:** Can effectively roll out to avoid pressure, especially when escaping blindside pressure.\n\n\n**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n\n* **Decision-Making:** Prone to staring down receivers, leading to sacks or interceptions when his first read is covered.  Needs to improve his ability to quickly move on from poorly-matched reads, especially against tight coverage.  Hesitates to throw into tight zone windows, even when favorable.\n* **Pressure Recognition:** While mobile, his reaction to pressure can be reactive rather than proactive, particularly against quick-developing pressure from secondary defenders. He needs better anticipation and quicker decision-making when blitzed.\n* **Leverage Reads:**  Struggles to accurately read the leverage of multiple defenders in short zones, leading to missed opportunities.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nGiven his strengths and weaknesses, Gabriel's game could be compared to a blend of quarterbacks.  His accuracy and arm talent are reminiscent of a young **Aaron Rodgers** (early career), but his decision-making inconsistencies and occasional hesitancy under pressure suggest a need for significant development, perhaps a comparison to a less-refined quarterback like a younger **Russell Wilson** (before refining his pocket presence) or even a **Jared Goff** in terms of needing to become more decisive under duress.  The mobility element brings to mind quarterbacks like **Josh Allen**, but Gabriel’s accuracy seems more refined early on.  Ultimately, he's a project with high upside who needs coaching to harness his talent consistently.\n"

He can effectively sidestep and climb the pocket to find open receivers, even on deep throws.  He demonstrates accuracy even off-platform and can anticipate receiver positioning on vertical routes.\n* **Accuracy under Pressure (situational):**  He displays pinpoint accuracy on certain throws, particularly when able to sidestep or climb the pocket effectively.\n\n**Opportunities/Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Reactive to Pressure:**  Gabriel is often reactive to pressure, particularly edge pressure, leading to poor decision-making. He frequently retreats or bolts the pocket prematurely, missing opportunities for climbs and checkdowns. This results in sacks, especially in the red zone.\n* **Pocket Maneuvering:**  Struggles with maneuvering within the pocket when facing pressure from multiple directions. He tends to roll to the same side, neglecting open receivers on the other side.  He can also get too close to his blockers, unnecessarily creating pressure.\n* **Anticipation:** While showing some anticipatory ability on vertical routes, he generally lacks anticipatory throws with timing routes.\n\n\n**NFL Player Comparison:**\n\nThe provided text doesn't offer enough information for a concrete NFL comparison.  However, his strengths and weaknesses suggest a player who possesses some mobility but needs significant development in processing pressure and decision-making.  Perhaps a comparison to a mobile quarterback with similar issues in their early career (like a young Josh Allen before significant development) could be drawn, albeit tentatively.  The comparison would hinge heavily on whether Gabriel can improve his decision-making under pressure and pocket awareness.\n"

He's reactive to pressure, sometimes fleeing the pocket prematurely instead of making a throw.\n* **Black-zone management:**  He needs significant improvement in handling situations inside his own 20-yard line.\n* **Anticipatory throwing:** While he shows some anticipation on vertical routes, it's not a consistent strength, especially against blitzes.\n\n**NFL Player Comparisons:**\n\nA direct comparison is difficult without more information, but Gabriel's profile suggests a player with a skillset similar to a game-manager type quarterback who excels in short passing situations.  He might be compared to a less mobile version of a quarterback who relies heavily on quick throws and pre-snap reads. The inconsistency in his decision-making prevents a comparison to a truly elite quarterback.  A more accurate comparison would require observing his play in more game situations and comparing his full skillset (e.g., arm strength, leadership qualities) to current NFL players.\n"

However, Jackson has demonstrated more consistent accuracy and decision-making over time, something Gabriel still needs to develop.\n\nIt is important to note that the lack of detailed stats makes precise comparisons difficult.

Implied to be a lower-tier prospect.\n* **Potential:** Backup QB.\n\n**Will Levis (QB42):**\n\n* **Strengths:**  Franchise arm, athletic ability.\n* **Opportunities:** Needs to improve decision-making and refine passing technique.  The comparison to Josh Allen highlights a high ceiling, but also significant risk.\n* **NFL Comparison:** Josh Allen (high ceiling, but with flaws), Carson Wentz (potential for inconsistency), Blaine Gabbert/Mitchell Trubisky (potential for middling career).\n* **Potential:**  Starter, but more realistically a No. 2 or No. 3 QB.\n\n**Tanner McKee (QB43):**\n\n* **Strengths:** Big arm, big body.\n* **Opportunities:** Needs to prove his college performance wasn't hampered by poor pass protection and adapt his approach accordingly.\n* **NFL Comparison:** Justin Herbert (high potential, but with question marks), Jacob Eason (similar build and potential, but ultimately unfulfilled).\n* **Potential:** No. 2-No. 3 QB on depth chart.\n\n**Kedon Slovis (QB44):**\n\n* **Strengths:** None explicitly stated; the description focuses on weaknesses.\n* **Opportunities:** Needs to improve speed, peripheral vision, and pocket presence.\n* **NFL Comparison:** None given.\n* **Potential:** XFL/CFL/USFL.\n\n**Gunnar Watson (QB45):**\n\n* **Strengths:** None explicitly stated; the description focuses on potential.\n* **Opportunities:** Developmental option, but likely outside the NFL.\n* **NFL Comparison:** None given.\n* **Potential:** Developmental option for a different league (XFL/CFL/USFL).\n\n**Carter Bradley (QB46):**\n\n* **Strengths:** The text cuts off before any strengths are listed.\n* **Opportunities:**  Unknown, the text is incomplete.\n* **NFL Comparison:** None given.\n* **Potential:** Unknown, the text is incomplete.\n\n\nThe analysis shows a range of prospects, from those with high potential (Levis) but significant flaws, to those considered developmental projects (Leary, Watson, Bradley) or unlikely to make an NFL roster (Slovis).  The incompleteness of the text for Bradley limits the assessment.\n"

His height (6'3\") might be considered a strength, but no other positive attributes are mentioned.\n* **Opportunities:**  His opportunities appear limited, with a projection to potentially play in a lower-tier professional league (XFL/CFL/USFL).\n* **Weaknesses:**  Significant mechanical, technical, and accuracy issues are noted.\n* **NFL Player Comparison:** N/A (No comparison provided).\n* **Potential:** Low.  The assessment suggests he's unlikely to make it to the NFL.\n"
